Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,I like that idea. I think it would help with cutting down on crime and provide more safety.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","Overall, I think it would be positive. If people are committing crimes, the surveillance would show it."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,It would probably affect it in a good way by helping with increasing public safety and decreasing crime. Evidence doesn't lie - the surveillance would hold people accountable.
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"I think some people might feel like their privacy is being invaded but overall, I think it is worth it if it means less crime and less death."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,I think it would build trust. I think people would feel like there's a sense of security and they would feel like they can trust what's going on.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"I think government should regulate it in making sure that everything is going like it should. If anything seems off, then I believe government should step in and see what's going on."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"Of course, I believe accuracy and reliability should be at the top of the list regarding what we should consider. If it's inaccurate, then it doesn't really serve its purpose. And the purpose would be to provide protection and security."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","I think with the economic effects, the positives would be keeping people out of jail. And by that, I mean people not being wrongly persecuted. With surveillance, we can know for sure who did what, and that would keep the wrong people out of jail and hopefully save money. And the negatives would be if the surveillance isn't durable and it's not reliable, if it needs to be maintained all the time, that could be a negative and cost a lot of money."
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"The decrease in crime should always be a priority. With privacy, it might be uncomfortable feeling like one does not have it, but I think we should learn to somewhat overlook that in place of security."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,"I don't think it plays a huge part, or any part at all. I think as long as the surveillance is not being tampered with, it would be okay. It is hard to have bias when it comes to evidence."
11,"Would small changes in Crime reduction lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",When it comes to cameras I think it would take large changes to see large positive support. If people aren't seeing any real change I don't think they would support it and they would be against it.
12,"What do you think are the main causes of Support for surveillance camera, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The main causes of support for surveillance cameras would be seeing a decrease in crime, and I'm pretty certain about that relationship, and it would be a positive effect."
13,"Would small changes in Crime prevention lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think when it comes to crime, it would take a big change to see a big change in support for the surveillance cameras, and that would be a positive effect."
14,How confident are you that changes in Public safety lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I'm fairly confident that changes in public safety would lead to a strong support for surveillance cameras and it would be a positive effect.
15,"Does Personal Privacy have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it depends on the person. Some people prefer privacy and some probably don't care about it. Like celebrities, they don't care too much about their privacy. So I think it just depends on the person and their personality, what they prefer. And it could be positive or negative, again, just depending on the person."
16,"Would small changes in Community trust lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it could be either small changes or moderate changes to see positive support for surveillance cameras, and again, it would be maybe like a moderate effect."
17,"Is the effect of Reliability on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think overall it could be somewhat immediate if people are seeing that the surveillance cameras are reliable and they're doing what they are supposed to do then there could definitely be a positive change, a positive effect and it would be fairly strong."
18,"Would small changes in Purpose of surveillance systems lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think if there are small changes in purpose of surveillance systems, there would be not very noticeable changes in the support. And the change, depending on what it is, could be positive or negative. And the effect could be strong or not very strong. It just depends."
19,"Does Cost savings from reduced incarceration have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It would be positive. I think people would see that as being a good thing, and it would be very significant and positive and very strong."
20,"Is the effect of Security over privacy on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It takes time to develop in my opinion, but I think it would be positive and it would be somewhat strong for the effect."
21,"Would small changes in Positive support for surveillance cameras lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think small changes would be noticeable. I don't think it would take a large shift, and depending on what the changes are, it could be positive or negative, and if they are big changes, then it would probably have a strong effect."
22,How would you describe the relationship between Positive effect and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"If there's a lot of positivity, then I believe there will be strong support for the surveillance cameras, and it would be positive."
23,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Surveillance cameras in public spaces, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","With the surveillance cameras, I think there will be a decrease if people are just uncomfortable with having them. And if there's safety, then I think it would lead to an increase. And with the safety, it would be positive. And if people are uncomfortable, then it would be negative."
24,How would you describe the relationship between Immediate Effect and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"And with the immediate effect, if it's a great and positive one, then that would bring about a lot of support for it."
25,"Is the effect of Strength of Effect on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I'm not really sure when it comes to this question. It's not clear to me. I'm not really understanding what it's asking.
