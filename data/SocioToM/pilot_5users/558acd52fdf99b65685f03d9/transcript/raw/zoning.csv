Based on your responses, the system may generate follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific topics. These new questions will be added to your interview flow automatically. This helps us capture your thinking process more thoroughly.","Okay, that's fine."
6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Okay.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"Me, personally, I support it. I feel like it would help with housing availability and help people to find affordable housing."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","As far as positive impacts are concerned, I feel like it would help, again, with available housing, but with the negatives, I feel like there will be a lot of traffic, like crowding and noise, probably, and just a lot of stuff going on that would probably be undesirable."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"I think with the policies, there would be more housing available that would be affordable. I think it is similar to buying groceries in bulk. With that, stores can afford to sell things cheaper. I think the same applies with housing: if more people are together in one space, it would probably be possible to rent out the spaces with a discount."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"In a way, I think it could be bad because with a lot of people all in one area, others have less control of who joins the community and the behaviors that people exhibit. So I think in a way it could be negative. But if all of the same type of people are around each other, like good people being around each other, then I think it could help the area and it would be a good area. It just depends on the people in the area."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"I definitely think there would be more demand for transportation and there would probably be more congestion because more people would be in an area and that area would need more transportation need. So with transportation, it will probably be more of a demand for it because of more people being in one area."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"I think the local government should play some part in it, maybe providing some oversight, but at the same time letting some of the people have some control and responsibility over it and managing it."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"Well, with something like that, I think smoking would have to be taken into consideration. If a lot of people are around each other and they're all smoking, that could be bad. So that's something to think about. And also, pollution and littering. If people are throwing trash around, that could be bad as well. And it would also look bad."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","I think it would help the people who are renting the spaces because it would probably be cheaper for them. I don't know how good it would be for the people, I guess it would be called realtors or something. I don't know if there would be many positives for them, but definitely positives for the people renting the spaces. But for the landlord people, I think it would help them to make more money if they can gather a lot of people and just have them all in one space and they're all paying like they're supposed to. I think it could help the landlords in that way. And I can't really see too many negatives as far as economic effects are concerned. I think overall it would be positive."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"I think the interest of current residents should be the first priority since they were there first, but also think about the future residents somewhat because they, too, need a place to stay."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,I think it plays a role in that everyone should be treated fairly and no one should be shown favoritism when it comes to housing and the zoning policies.
17,"Does Housing availability have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think housing availability has a positive effect on support for upzoning because I think the more houses available, the more people will be in support of it. They'll feel like they have a place to stay and that they're taken care of when it comes to housing."
18,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for Upzoning, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think what would lead to a decrease in the support is if people are being negatively affected by it. For example, if there's a lot of crime going on or like a lot of noise, that could decrease the support for it. And for increases of upzoning, I think if people feel like they're being heard and listened to and taken care of, then they'll support it. And that would be a positive thing."
19,"Would small changes in Traffic congestion lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it would take at least a moderate change in traffic congestion to see any changes. And with the changes, it would be a positive effect that would be fairly good."
20,How confident are you that changes in Community control lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm pretty confident in that regarding the changes in community control. If there are good changes, then I definitely believe the support will be strong. I think overall people just want to see positive changes. And if there are positive changes, then I really believe that it'll be supported."
21,How would you describe the relationship between Increased Demand for Transportation and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"As I'm reading this description, I don't really see a connection between the two things. If there is one, it's not obvious to me."
22,"Does Pollution have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think with pollution it would have a negative effect. I don't think people want to live in an area where it's polluted all the time. So it would definitely be a negative thing and it would probably be moderately negative.
23,"Does Economic benefits overall have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think economic benefits has a strong effect regarding support for upzoning. If the benefits are good, which they should be, since that's what benefits typically are, they're good, then people will support it. I think we as people all care about economic effects, and so I really feel like it would play a large part in the whole process."
24,"Does Zoning decisions have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it would depend on what the zoning decisions are. It's hard to say if it would be positive or negative without knowing what they are specifically.
25,"Would small changes in Fair Treatment lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think small changes would yield small results for the support and large changes would bring about large or strong support.
26,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Upzoning policies, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think what would lead to increases or decreases in the policies is if people are requesting the changes in the policies and as far as how significant they would be. I think if they are life-changing, then they would be significant, and if they're not life-changing, then they would be insignificant, and regarding if they would be positive or negative, I think it would just depend on the changes in the policies."
27,"Is the effect of Positive effect on support for upzoning on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think with some things, it could be immediate, but overall, I do think we as people have to have patience. So with some changes, it would probably take a good amount of time to see any real change or effect from it. And I do believe, overall, it would have a positive effect and the effect would probably be somewhat strong."
28,How confident are you that changes in Negative Effect lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm fairly confident that if the changes are decreasing negative effects, that would largely increase the support for it in a positive way."
