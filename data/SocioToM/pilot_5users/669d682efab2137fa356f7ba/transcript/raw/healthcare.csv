Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,"Fully support universal health care. Health care is a human right. And in advance, I'll be a bit blunt on these answers because on Prolific, it said that the survey should last about an hour. But it's been well over an hour, and it's very late at night, so I'm getting very tired. But explanation aside, yes, health care is a basic human right. Everyone has a right to it. It's essentially absolutely terrible to decide who deserves to live and who deserves to live well based on how much money they have or the history their family has, what kind of privilege they come from. That's about it."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","I can't see anything negative aside from very many people are going to bitch about it, especially the rich. I suppose it's negative for the rich. Positive, it'll give people the care that they need. Basically every successful nation I can think of has universal health care. We will be following the morality of the basic principles of human rights, which is that every person deserves to live. We are not valuing life based on its financial worth, that's a positive. Those are a couple of the more significant impacts that I can see."
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,"I think it would make healthcare far more accessible. There are so many people who put off seeking care who decide not to treat things when it could be life-saving otherwise because they can't afford it. It will absolutely improve accessibility. Of course, there's something to say about quality. Hospitals will need some time to adjust to everything, but once they do, it'll absolutely be beneficial. I think that once everything is put into place, it will absolutely improve quality as well. For instance, right now, quality is terrible because if you can't afford something, then you're not getting the best treatments that you could. If everyone got the treatment they needed, that's already better quality."
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,"I mean, I think it would be great. There would be less private insurance, less funding going to those corrupt, horrible people. I think that there would be a lot more time and money not being spent on terrible things like that to go towards actually innovating and helping and knowing what problems people have and what needs to be solved. I definitely am not as well versed on this topic. I don't know very much about medical research. I can't see it having a negative effect that more people are getting care on medical innovation. If anything, maybe we get some new case studies or maybe we'd even find some new cures to things. We'd find different people who are immune to different things and we'd be able to find the causes. There are so many different benefits to actually keeping people alive and treating them."
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,"It would be a significant weight lifted, especially for people of lower income. I can't imagine the burden lifted. There are so many people who are in such significant medical debt. There are people who save their entire lives for retirement and then end up getting cancer and lose everything because of the cost of the treatment, even with insurance. It would be such a burden lifted. There are people who die for this every single day. Private insurance is quite literally murdering people. So the burden of not worrying that you're going to lose everything or die because you get sick is a significant burden lifted from individuals and families alike."
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,"I mean, I'm pretty sure that that's how it should be, is that the government takes care of its people. Is that what's happening? No. Do I trust this current administration to do it? Absolutely not. But, um, I'm not entirely sure about financing. I'm pretty sure that, just, yeah, I would assume the government would be in charge of that. There would be a total subset of it to do that, and people would be voted in for it. Um, even if it were put down to, like, local governments, I'd be fine with that, as long as there's some sort of regulation, and taxpayer dollars are going towards that, and not the military. I'm fine with it, you know?"
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,"I don't really fully understand what that means, health care provider concerns. I mean, I think that health care providers are in it to save lives. I guess maybe if health care providers want to make more money from private insurance, then that's not great for them. But at that point, I think we just understand who deserves to become a doctor and who's just in it for money, who's not going to take care of their patients properly. So I don't think it should very much factor into it unless potentially health care providers are worried that they won't be able to give care as well, in which case we should listen to them. I'm not a health care provider, so I don't know what concerns they would come into. I don't know if it would be positive or negative or what. So I can't really answer that in good faith or with knowledge."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?","I mean, again, taxes might be higher because we're paying for some sort of universal healthcare system. Um, so that would be a negative for most people. Positive, you know, maybe you wouldn't have to pay as much to survive. So on an individual basis, that's pretty great. More money can go towards local businesses or generally other things. Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount. I would say perhaps rather than a significant amount of our taxes going towards that they could go towards this instead, and we wouldn't even have to pay a significant amount more because taxes are already pretty up there."
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,"This is a weird question because taxpayers are health care consumers. The general public is what it is. And I don't, I mean, if the question is people who are rich talking about people who are disabled or need medical care, then of course, people who need health care should be prioritized. People have a right to live. It's already been like, you people have a right to housing. You people have a right to food. The answer is yes to all of it. But of course, people have a right to survive. People have a right to their health and to live, to live. You can't say someone deserves to die because you don't want to pay taxes. That's a disgusting, cruel thing. And people like that should not be prioritized."
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,"A thousand percent, that's everything. The fact that you shouldn't be told you have the right to survive or not based on your equity, based on how much you have. The rich shouldn't survive just because they're rich and the poor shouldn't have to suffer or be in debt or die just because they can't afford care. That's the basis of universal health care is that everybody is equal in their right to survive. No matter what kind of person you are, no matter how much you have, no matter what you own, you have a right to survive. That's the basis of it. It's more that morality and humanity has a role in health care policy."
11,How confident are you that changes in Universal healthcare lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I don't understand this question. Changes in universal health care lead to changes in support. Well yes, any changes in universal health care would lead to changes in how people feel about it, be it positive or negative. I don't know how strong the effect would be because I don't know what changes are being made to universal health care. This question doesn't make sense."
12,"Is the effect of Equity in healthcare on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I mean, that's pretty much the entire basis of supporting universal healthcare as it is. Equity is the main point, as I've said before. It's already an immediate effect. Is it like, oh, by equity, do you mean money? I was thinking equality. So equity is like how much you own. I mean, it's already immediate. If you have a lot of money, you can survive, you can afford to live. That's already an immediate thing that everybody knows. It's a very, depending on how you're looking at it, negative thing that people with more money can afford to live and can afford to pay for treatments. It's a very strong effect, which has already been discussed."
13,How confident are you that changes in Negative public reaction lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"answers itself. Changes in negative public reaction will lead to changes in health care. Yes. Support for it, I mean. Yes. Negative public reaction will have a negative effect. Yes."
14,"Does Human rights and moral principle have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It depends on what side you're on. If you believe in human rights and morals, then it would have a positive effect on support. And if you don't believe that humans have a basic right to health and survival, then they would have a negative effect. This just fully depends on the kind of person that you are. So yeah, it has an effect. It just depends on your own morality."
15,"Would small changes in Healthcare accessibility lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I mean, yes, I suppose small changes in the right direction would lead to changes in support. I don't know what kind of changes they would be, if it was positive or negative changes. If we were going towards accessibility for all, then maybe people wouldn't be as persistent on universal healthcare, but that would be because things are getting better. I think that no matter what, we should be fighting for universal healthcare because rather than things getting just a little bit better, they should be equal."
16,"What factors affect Support for universal healthcare, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think that we've already discussed these factors for the most part. It would be, um, the biggest factor would be for horrible people who don't care about human life would be, Oh, but taxes, it would be how much taxes are. That's definitely the biggest effect in one direction. Um, that has a big influence on lots of people who care about money more than human life. So that would be negative towards universal healthcare. I would say something positive for it would be believing that human life is equal and how much money you have doesn't have an effect on if you deserve to live or not. That's pretty much the biggest thing. And of course there's just moving towards a better society. I would say that's pretty much the biggest thing is just the right to life."
17,How confident are you that changes in Less private insurance lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I mean, this question is also redundant because if there's less private insurance, then yeah, people would probably want universal health care. Like if there's less private insurance, it means that we're moving towards universal health care. So yeah, it would have a positive effect on supporting universal health care. I don't fully understand this question."
18,How would you describe the relationship between Relief from financial worry and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"an incredibly strong effect. I think if people didn't have to worry about paying to survive, they would prefer to have universal health care. It is a very strong connection because, you know, not having to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for your cancer treatment is definitely a lot better than going completely bankrupt. I would say that it increases support, yes."
19,How would you describe the relationship between Government responsibility for healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I would say I guess this has a bit of an effect in both directions, because number one, yes, the government has a right to, or not the government has a right, the people have a right to have a government that takes care of them. However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration. So I'm not sure if people would trust the government entirely. So it could be positive, it might be negative. However, the government definitely should be responsible, that's what I can say for certain."
20,How confident are you that changes in Healthcare provider motivations lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Personally don't think it would have a really big effect. I don't know what their, like I said, I have no idea what their motivations would be. I'm not a healthcare provider. I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there. So yeah, not much of an effect, but I don't know if this is a positive or a negative thing because I don't know what their motivations would be."
21,How would you describe the relationship between Individual Financial Relief and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"So, I think this is the same question that was asked before, which is relief from financial worry. So, I have already answered this and it would be the same answer as the question about relief from financial worry. It's the same answer."
22,How would you describe the relationship between Prioritization of vulnerable populations and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Once again, it completely depends on how you feel. It's a very strong connection. It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that. For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact. But I think that for people with morality and humanity who care about the sanctity of human life and understand that everyone deserves to live, whether they're born disabled or whether they become disabled or whether they are poor or whether they're anybody of any kind, if you are a human being, you have a right to live. If you are a creature, you have a right to live. And I would say people who believe that, it is a very strong effect in the right direction."
23,"Does Right to healthcare have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",fully understand what this means because yes if you have a right to health care if there is a right to health care then it would lead to support for it of course because right to health care means that everybody has health care and that is universal health care so it's kind of asking if universal health care has a positive or negative effect on universal health care.
24,How would you describe the relationship between Human right to survival and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"So this is the same as the last question because the right to survive is the right to health care. It's the right to be saved without worrying about money. It's the same answer as the last one, yes."
25,"Would small changes in Access to Care lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I mean, yes, if people had more access to care, then maybe they wouldn't be as worried about immediately having universal healthcare, but universal healthcare would lead to everybody having access to care. So I think that maybe potentially, once people realize how nice it is for everybody to have access to care and how it really doesn't affect them that much, perhaps more people would be in support of it. I would hope so, realizing that it benefits absolutely everybody."
26,How confident are you that changes in Universal Health Care lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Reading this question does not make sense. How confident that changes in universal health care lead to changes in support for universal health care? It depends on the changes. I don't know what they would be. I can't answer this question because I don't understand this question.
27,How would you describe the relationship between Moral Right to Survive and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,So this would be the exact same answer as the same question asked with human right to survival and the right to health care. So this is the same question asked for a third time and it's the same answer.
28,"Is the effect of Equality in Healthcare on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I mean, the effect would be immediate, but of course it would take time to develop. For instance, transportation to get to hospitals, hospitals and how well funded they are in poorer areas. Equality is something that takes a long time to develop fully. But universal healthcare will definitely help step in the right direction towards it. So I hope that people who care about equality in healthcare will very much support universal healthcare as a step in the right direction towards equality. I would say it has a pretty strong effect on people who believe that people are equal, yes."
29,What causes changes in Healthcare as a human right? Are these influences strong or weak?,I don't think anything changes the fact that healthcare is a human right. There's no such thing as change. I don't understand this question at all because it's just a moral fact that healthcare is a human right. That doesn't change.
