Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"do not support it. Reason being, I don't trust the police to begin with. I think that surveillance is an invasion of privacy, and while yes, it might increase safety because people are worried about being recorded, it's not a foolproof means, and if you watch any true crime documentaries or anything of the sort, then it definitely does not deter people, and people can easily disguise their faces, and people can easily disappear or figure out where it is, and of course police can abuse that, knowing where they are, if police are the ones in charge. Either way, it's an invasion of privacy, and I would be very uncomfortable being surveyed everywhere I walk or go or drive."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","I think the most positive impact is probably just extra safety. Maybe it'll make people feel a bit safer, it might deter people from committing some very obvious crimes. I think that negative is it is an invasion of privacy, it can be used against people, it can be used for blackmail, it can be used in nefarious ways, and it's really difficult to trust the people in charge. I wouldn't personally."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"I think that it would definitely make things a little bit safer. It might deter crime just a bit. In lots of cities that do have very good surveillance, crime is still pretty up there. I don't think it would really deter anybody. I mean, people already know that DNA evidence, like, most crimes will get figured out for the most part. I would say it would decrease maybe petty crimes like car break-ins in areas where there's surveillance. But even then, people can just wear hoods. There will still be really dumb people. I think that crime rates would go down, but it wouldn't be significant enough to be worth the breach of privacy."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"it would have a significant effect. As I've mentioned before, personal privacy would be jeopardized. It would be very difficult to believe that you are not being watched. If you have a stalker, for instance, in the police force, if they're the ones regulating it, that would be absolutely terrible. I think it would make me feel more unsafe and it would make me feel safe, honestly, especially in my own neighborhood where I feel relatively safe a lot of the time. I think that it can definitely be used for things like blackmail. It can be used against people and it would definitely take away liberty, but I don't know how to explain that as well as I do just a breach of privacy."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"I think it would have community trust, I think, would not be affected. I think that within communities in some areas, it's already a good amount of trust. If anything, I think the idea of needing surveillance cameras might make people a little bit more weary of others, just considering it's there. Like, yeah, you might feel personally safer, but it's already like, wow, I really can't trust the people around me, huh? That's why we have these cameras, that kind of energy. As for police community relations, they're already pretty terrible for the most part. I'm generalizing there, but from my experience, they're absolutely terrible to begin with. It's a corrupt organization, in my opinion, already. So adding more power to that would be absolutely devastating to police community relations."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"Absolutely none. It's similar to police. I don't think that people in power should have this sort of data on civilians. It is a huge breach of privacy and it does not make me feel safe. I would not want that. I think it would be absolutely terrible. I think that if this is going to be a thing, if there is going to be some sort of surveillance, it absolutely should be community elected individuals. It should be people who are seen generally as trustworthy, who can prove they are trustworthy, who are seen by the general public as trustworthy. Not just the government. I think that that's absolutely terrible. It should be a local thing. It should not be a nationwide thing. And of course, people think organizations like the FBI are absolutely going to have access to it. It just feels like this can easily be used to turn things into a fascist state if we don't disallow the government from being involved in that."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"I mean, it absolutely factors in. For instance, it could be like, oh, well, we saw the person who committed this crime was a big black man, for instance. And of course, the wrong person might be absolutely convicted. Or for instance, they might see somebody, it might look dark. And of course, with stereotypes and with the way that this racist judicial system works, they'll be like, oh, oh, it might totally just be some white dude who looks dark in the image, you know? Or like some white dude who looks tanned. They'll be like, oh, it was a Latino or oh, it was a black man, you know? Something like that. And absolutely, it'll be used to profile. There's no way, it's going to be really bad. The grainy footage, it's not like we're gonna have HD cameras on every street. It's going to be grainy, especially at night. And I wouldn't even say they're that reliable. Yeah, it might be helpful, but there's no way it would be used for profiling. There's no way it wouldn't be used for profiling, I mean."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","I can't see any economic effects coming out of it. Like, yes, the crime rate might go down. I don't know what effect that might have economically. I kind of just see a negative effect in the terms of this is going to cost cities to keep going. It costs money to keep this going. If anything, I can just see a negative economic impact and potentially a positive social impact, although it disrupts too many private liberties or personal liberties, and I can't really say that there's a positive economic impact to it, not in my opinion."
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"I am certainly biased in this because I think that law enforcement is a very corrupt organization as is. I think it needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up to be an institution that is not prejudiced and violent and lawless. So I think that privacy advocates should absolutely be listened to far more because so far the people don't have power when it comes to fighting against law enforcement, speaking out against law enforcement. Already law enforcement should be turning on their body cameras for things when they just don't. They turn it off and they commit crimes, things like that. I think that we have to deal with law enforcement and how corrupt it is first before we even consider giving them any sort of extra leverage on innocent people who they are just destroying the communities of."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,"it would have a significant impact because of course there's going to be more surveillance in poor communities, of course there's going to be more surveillance in areas where there are primarily people of color living. There's no way there's not going to be a bias added to this surveillance. It's going to be absolutely terrible. In the same way that there's more police surveillance in areas where there are poorer people or people of color, the same thing's going to happen with surveillance technology. There's no way it's not going to be prejudiced against people, absolutely none. I think it should have a significant effect on discussions about it. I think it's going to be something incredibly contentious if that's what it gets down to, especially in this sort of political climate, but the reality is it's going to be used in nefarious ways. It's not going to be used equally."
11,How would you describe the relationship between Privacy Invasion and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think I already described that pretty well. Privacy invasion is something that people will take very seriously. Either you don't care or you feel very strongly about it. I don't really think there's much of an in-between. Those are two extremes. Or at the very least, if you're not feeling like an extreme, black or white, you're in a gray area in the middle, it's you're gonna be uncomfortable with it, knowing that you're being watched at all times and that potentially something can be used against you. Or maybe if you have a stalker, especially someone who's in law enforcement, you might worry about what that'll do. Or if you have someone in law enforcement who has a vendetta against you, there are absolutely evil people in law enforcement. Not everybody, but very many. And that would absolutely be concerning. Privacy invasion, people are already paranoid with the intranets and how things can be tracked back to them and how they can be stalked or things like that. It's going to be so much worse with just cameras pointing at you everywhere. I would say it's a pretty strong connection and it has a very negative effect."
12,"What factors do you think influence Support for surveillance camera, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The factors that I can imagine influencing support are pretty much what we've already discussed. Safety, privacy, corruption, potentially economic factors, though I can't see people caring about that one as much as the other three. I think that this question is a bit repetitive because those are what we've been discussing so far."
13,How confident are you that changes in Crime Deterrence lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"that's pretty much the only positive that I can see is that potentially less crime in areas where there's more crime would lead to support for it for sure. I would say it has a positive effect and support and I would say not the strongest effect ever, but definitely a strong effect. Yeah, it would definitely help people feel like if something happens to them, they're more likely to get justice and might deter people. But once again, it's very easy to just disguise yourself and someone else might get blamed and then there's all those other things. But in regards to this, yes, this is a positive thing."
14,"Would small changes in Invasion of Privacy lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think that whether it's small or all at once, it would still be pretty bad, especially because if it was small, I can see it really, really very evidently affecting poorer communities, lower income communities, or areas with more people of color. I can see it immediately being something that people would be able to very easily mark as a sort of bias, some sort of discrimination. If things happened all at once, maybe it would actually be less obvious. I really can't imagine how it would go, and I think this completely depends on the area that you are in and the way that things are where you are. Like, it's completely dependent. I can't answer this question for absolutely everywhere. It's too much of a generalization."
15,"Is the effect of Trust Issues on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't fully understand what this question means, like trust issues for what? For the surveillance or for the people in charge, for law enforcement or for the government? I don't think the question is clear enough for me to know how to answer it."
16,"Does Deterrence of Crime have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","This question was asked earlier as well, when it was asked, how confident are you that changes in crime deterrence lead to changes for support for the surveillance cameras? Does it have a positive effect increasing it or a negative effect decreasing it? How strong is this effect? It's the same question, just worded differently. So there's already an answer to that."
17,How confident are you that changes in Public Safety lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"that this is actually on the exact same vein as crime deterrence, like it would lead to more public safety in terms of, hey, things might not happen to you as easily. Maybe it'll make you feel safer just walking along the street. I think this falls into the exact same vein, like yes, public safety and crime deterrence fall hand in hand. And it's pretty much the only positive effect there is. And it's the only strong effect I can think of."
18,"Is the effect of Breach of Privacy on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Oh, that's absolutely immediate. Yeah, your privacy is breached the moment that you're being filmed without your consent. And it's not like every single person is consenting to being filmed every moment of their lives in the area that they're in. And even if you know it's there, like you can't opt out of it, you can't say yes or no, you just exist in those areas and don't have a choice. So I would say it's an immediate effect. I don't understand how it would take time to develop if the cameras are just there already. And of course it has a negative effect, a very strong effect. That's one of the biggest reasons that people would despise it or dislike it or not want it."
19,"Is the effect of Personal privacy on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe this is the same question as the last one, breach of privacy and the effect of personal privacy. It seems like the exact same question. I'm sorry to keep repeating that, but I would just give the exact same answer. I don't know what else to say, so it's the same answer. Yes is the last one."
20,"Does Weary of others have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think that this question is worded very oddly. Does weary of others have a positive or negative effect? I mean, being weary of others is a pretty, I guess it's important to be weary of others. I think we should be weary of others even without surveillance cameras. I don't understand what this question is pointing to. I think it may be one of the questions that is like added because of one of the answers that I gave and I don't quite know how to answer it. So I apologize there. I think that being weary of others sounds like a negative thing generally, but it's something important that we should be doing now even without surveillance cameras."
21,"Does Privacy Concerns have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Once again, I'm pretty sure this question was already asked when it was asked, is the effect of personal privacy on support? And back when it was also asked, is the effect of breach of privacy on support in the last few questions? So it's the exact same answer that I would give. I apologize for repeating that, but it's the same answer. A very negative effect because it's a breach of privacy and people can use that against you."
22,"Would small changes in Racial Profiling lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think that generally racial profiling would lead to very, I don't understand what small changes in racial profiling means. It's already something that exists and something that, I mean, if it were getting worse or better, there's no way it would get better with surveillance cameras. It would just be getting worse. Of course it would have a negative effect on it. And of course it would be strong depending on the community in which you live. It's totally dependent on where you live and what things are like in your area. I think the only people that would be pleased that more racial profiling was happening are likely incredibly right-wing or potentially racist. I don't see any positive unless somehow racial profiling were getting better, which it wouldn't be if you're trying to find criminals on cameras."
23,"Would small changes in Negative economic impact lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","This question answers itself, small changes in negative economic impact. So I assume this would mean economic impact is getting worse. If negative economic impact is becoming more negative, it's going to have a negative effect. If small changes in negative economic impact means it's becoming less negative, then it will have a positive impact. This question answers itself, so it's kind of redundant."
24,How would you describe the relationship between Dismantling and rebuilding law enforcement and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Oh, for sure. If law enforcement were less corrupt and more trustworthy and had a better relationship with communities, then yes, definitely it would be easier for people to accept them as enforcing surveillance, which again is still a breach of privacy. But I think taking out the effects of a corrupt law enforcement is definitely a very positive impact, and it's a pretty strong effect because I think one of the biggest recoils is distrust for the police. So if that were definitely restructured and made better, if it were reformed, so to say, I think that that would be good for everybody, not even just in this effect, just altogether. So it would be a net positive if the laws of law enforcement were reformed, for sure."
25,How would you describe the relationship between Power imbalance between law enforcement and privacy advocates and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think this is based on one of the questions I was asked, which is, yeah, I would say this is law enforcement has a say in absolutely everything. They have more power and are completely lawless. It's like cops can get away with so many horrific things and the judicial system is not all that much better for the most part. I would say that if law enforcement has this kind of insane power, then of course there's an imbalance between them and just the general population, which is where privacy advocates would be, unless, A, it would be great if there were a privacy advocate in government or local governments. But aside from that, no, the general public do not have as much power as law enforcement. It's a very strong connection to it and has a very negative effect against surveillance."
26,"Does Nefarious Use have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","this question answers itself to in and of the definition of nefarious. Nefarious is not a good thing. So it would definitely have a negative effect on support for surveillance. Because yes, using something for a bad thing is bad. And I think most people would see it as bad. So I think that this is a question maybe the AI picked up on, but it answers itself right there."
27,"What do you think are the main causes of Privacy Invasion, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I mean, privacy invasion happens for very many reasons. It's political surveillance, potentially surveillance by law enforcement that feels scorned or even an individual that feels scorned. It can be stalking, obsession. There are a multitude of reasons, financial reasons, financial, personal, political. Those are the big three. And of course I'm certain about these relationships. They happen all the time. There's tons of privacy invasion over the internet constantly to begin with. There's always stalking. Things like this just make them significantly more dangerous. So it's like already pre-existing privacy invasion made so much easier for the offenders. And of course they're a very negative thing. I can't imagine privacy invasion would ever be a positive thing. And you can even argue in cases of like, oh, well they find criminals through that. Yeah, okay, well also regular people are hurt through that very significantly. So it's not for the greater good, not at all."
