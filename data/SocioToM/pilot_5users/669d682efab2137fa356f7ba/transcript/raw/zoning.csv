6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,All right. Ready.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"So, I think this significantly interrupts things. Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","I think that overcrowding is a big concern for me. I also think that older people would not be able to adapt as well. I think that the already existing businesses, which are doing just fine, would have a hard time competing with all the new ones that came in, maybe more modern ones. It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems. I don't see how it could be beneficial in very many areas."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"I think that it would make things more affordable, again maybe in terms of rent, but then I think about places like New York City where the apartments are, I mean there are plenty of them, but they're ridiculously expensive. I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"I think it would definitely absolutely change neighborhoods, especially in neighborhoods that have single-family housing. It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it. Neighborhood in particular, yeah, it would be absolutely horrific for several years, maybe even a decade or so. I don't think it's worth it."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"There are some cities that have good transportation systems, but again, these are areas that already have Very many apartments areas like New York or Chicago with you know subways or trains Metros for instance things like that like there are plenty of there's public transportation in cities that already need it. However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort. I don't see how this would be a beneficial thing Unless it's in cities. They've already established some sort of public transportation"
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"I mean, I think it would be entirely up to them to make up for absolutely everything. The public would not have to make up for this if they're doing something like that. It is up to them to fix public transportation. It is up to them to figure out how to manage schools. It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established. It would be totally up to local government to establish new things, not just the general public. I don't understand how it would be up to them."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"Oh, I am significantly concerned about that. Already trying to get resources for like the general population of a city, like things like the natural gases that you would need, things for energy, electricity, power. I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."
17,"Would small changes in Higher density housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."
18,"Does Disruption to community have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."
19,How would you describe the relationship between Adaptation of older people and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."
20,What causes changes in Support for Upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?,"think that I've been pretty clear on what causes changes in support. For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer. And these influences are both strong and weak, depending, I think that this is all the questions that have already been answered before, basically, I can't like list them all over again."
21,How would you describe the relationship between Housing affordability and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in. It's unfortunate."
22,"Does Neighborhood character have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","So I would say it has a negative effect because Every neighborhood again already is kind of established. There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"
23,"Is the effect of Public Transportation on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope. It has an extremely negative impact unless the city already has an established and efficient public transportation system."
24,"Does Environmental Concerns have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."
25,How confident are you that changes in Natural Gas Usage lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think that this goes hand-in-hand with environmental issues. It's unfortunately not something that people think about. I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer. Depending on how environmentally ethical you are, it either has a strong negative effect or other people won't even think about it."
26,How confident are you that changes in Monopolies lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I don't understand what changes in monopolies means. I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."
27,How confident are you that changes in Current residents' interests lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it. So I would say it has a pretty strong effect because content people are more likely to accept change than people who are already having a hard time or are already angry about something.
28,How would you describe the relationship between Right to Shelter and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Oh, it's an extremely strong connection. Every human being has a right to live. They have a right to shelter. They have a right to water. They have a right to food. They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."
29,"Does Negative effects on population and economy have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","that this question answers itself. Do negative effects on population and economy have a positive or negative effect on support? Well, there are negative effects. So of course, they have a negative effect. I think that this is an extended question that didn't really come out quite right, or maybe wasn't necessary to ask because this is already, it answers itself."
30,How confident are you that changes in Older residents lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I don't really understand what changes in older residence means. I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way. So again, not a super clear question, but that's the answer I think I can give."
31,"Is the effect of School capacity on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Oh, this is for sure an immediate concern. Schools are already really full and there are not enough teachers generally all over the nation. So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already. Adding even more weights to something that's breaking is not going to be efficient or effective or good."
32,"What do you think are the main causes of Single-family neighborhoods, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.
