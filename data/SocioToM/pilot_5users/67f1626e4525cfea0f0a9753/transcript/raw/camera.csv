Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"I’m somewhat cautious about widespread surveillance cameras. On one hand, they can help reduce crime and make people feel safer. But on the other hand, there are big concerns about privacy, misuse of data, and the chance that certain groups might be unfairly targeted. So, I support using cameras carefully, with strong rules to protect privacy and prevent abuse."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","Increasing surveillance cameras can improve public safety by deterring crime and helping solve cases faster. However, it also raises privacy concerns, risks misuse of data, can unfairly target marginalized groups, and may make people feel less comfortable in public spaces."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,Surveillance technologies can help reduce crime by making it harder for criminals to act unnoticed and by providing evidence for investigations. But they aren’t a complete solution and must be balanced with privacy protections to avoid misuse.
