Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,This is a hard one for me because I do support it because I have received public health insurance before I'm in a situation now I can't get it and but I don't want to rely on other people's taxes paying for my health care so I'm 50-50
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","I think the most significant aspects is people will be getting care, like me, who can't afford it.

6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,"I've been offered lower health care, but it's not profitable enough for me. Paying out of pocket for the health care that the government provides now, it's not much cheaper than paying out of pocket, and it's not something that is desirable for me because you can't have the doctor you want. Your medicines that you rely on are not covered. So it would have to be very specific advantages for me to be for it."
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,the choice of the people would make a difference.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?","I don't know. I know that eventually someone's going to be paying for it, whether it be through taxes or whether it be out of pocket from the people. I don't know."

11,"Does Government-funded healthcare have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect?

12,"What factors do you think influence Support for universal healthcare, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think the factors that play into it is the advantage is everybody would have health care. Sick people would be provided with the care they need. Now, I can go into a hospital now and I will be treated. Will it be the best treatment? I don't know because I would be there as an uninsured, out-of-pocket individual. But the other aspect of it, morally, I think as a doctor, they would take care of me and do what they're supposed to do. But on the other aspect of it, my credit score would be affected. So, we all have to take responsibility for ourselves. So, the less government and the more the people, but the positive aspects of the factor, the influence, the support of the universal health care system is people that need help would be getting it."

I don't know how it works. This area, on this respect, I really don't have a lot of opinions because I'm actually going through it right now, so you think I would have opinions, but I'm at a point where I don't know what to do, so I'm going without and paying out of pocket."
