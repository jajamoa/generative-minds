6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,"Okay, I'm ready."
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,I'd say I support it about 75%.
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","I would hope that the most important impact would be lowering the cost of living for the housing crisis for individuals, I would say in my area especially, the cost of renting or owning a home has skyrocketed."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"Well, from my understanding, from what I read, upzoning would help lower the cost of rent. I forget what it said, but I'm thinking 10-15%, which is an excellent advantage for those who are desperate for housing."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"There would be problems with traffic, school systems, and the crowding is a worrisome part. Small towns lose that small town feel and become more of a hustle and a bustle. So finding a middle ground for keeping things at a slower pace but allowing for more homes would be the goal."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"Well, transportation would have to be overhauled, traffic signals, roadways, sidewalks, public transportation if it's not there needs to be brought into the city. So these are bringing upzoning in would involve multiple other areas, but it's still vital to be done."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"Well, the local zoning group, the city council members, all of these people would be involved. Things would have to be overhauled. People maybe have to be brought in that haven't been a part of it before so that all the statistics and issues can be figured out. For example, currently in my city, we have an overcrowding. For some reason, the city has been allowing more and more and more and more apartments to come in, but none of these are affordable apartments. These are high-end apartments, and the lower-income families are becoming homeless."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"I suppose environmental factors like sewage, making sure the water and sewage is dealt with is highly important because without the abilities to deal with that, that could cause major issues. So that environmentally is important for that, electricity, enough power, enough electricity, enough fuel for fueling cars. And then the, you know, the byproduct of all of that, including refuge, trash."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","Well, both positive and negative results would be positive for the changing the laws would be allowing for lower cost of living, lower rent, lower, more affordability. That would be an excellent, positive, very important aspect about bringing up, you know, allowing the changes for zoning to be made. And then you have the negative, which is the cost of changing and making sure roads, trash, utilities, schools, all of these things have to be addressed, which take time and money."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"I think current residents should have a say. I really do, especially in the smaller communities. Now on the outskirts of town where there's more property, more availability to put in some taller buildings that wouldn't obstruct some of these housing districts, would be a better option. So I think involving the community in each separate housing district, getting the views of the people, and making sure that there's a middle ground for everybody."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,I don't think they play a role.
17,"What factors do you think influence Support for Upzoning, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I'd say the biggest influence for supporting upzoning is housing affordability is number one.
18,"Is the effect of Lowering the cost of living on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It has a positive effect. Bringing in more people that can afford to live, all these people will be paying for utilities, paying for sewage, paying for their trash and refuge, paying to shop for their necessities. So this brings in multiple aspects of influencing and bringing money back into the community."
19,How would you describe the relationship between Reduction in rent costs and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It has a strong connection because it it will bring in funds for we're talking middle class affordability, middle lower class affordability of homes is a is a support of upzoning because it's strong connection because it brings money back into the community. Taxing brings money back into the government for structures, street care, utility care to up build it all."
20,"Would small changes in Transportation overhaul lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, I believe small changes in transportation would make a big difference. It could bring in people that choose to use public transportation rather than overcrowding with different cars and such in apartment, especially in upzoning a lot of people would rather walk, drive, or use public transportation."
21,How would you describe the relationship between Overhaul of Current Systems and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I say changes in transportation and the relationship between overhauling the current system and supporting for the upzoning system is a positive thing. I think it would bring in multi-million dollars to the community, to the shopping, to the small businesses, to the utilities, to the sewer, to the local government. It's a positive aspect."
22,"Does Affordable Housing have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It has a positive aspect, it has a positive influence upon it. The effect is increasing the homes to bring in the money to bring the people to support the community."
23,How would you describe the relationship between sewage management and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It's a big connection, the connection between sewage and upzoning. Upzoning and sewage will definitely have to collaborate and make sure that the infrastructure is there, and if it's not, it will require building and providing the sewage and the water capabilities. And then from that, the money would be brought back in because the people would be paying for the sewage and utilities that that all involves."
24,"Would small changes in Affordability lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think the small changes in affordability will lead to noticeable changes in support. If people are actually able to see that, say we start with one building, and it doesn't cause the issues that people are concerned about. That the issues of the overcrowding have been dealt with. The roads, the lights, the sidewalks, the trash, the utilities. All of it's dealt with, and the building, the people that are brought in, actually contribute to the community and not cause a problem. So if the attributes that need to be dealt with before the building comes in, and they see that the community is actually flourishing, then more buildings can come in, but at a limit."
25,How confident are you that changes in Community involvement lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Yes, it has a powerful effect. The community, the trust, I believe the trust is what makes it a positive."
26,"Does Housing affordability have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","This is kind of a repetitive question you're asking, but yes, I believe that housing affordability has a positive effect in supporting upzoning, and I believe it's a significant effect. If the housing affordability in this, my local area, was reduced by 10%, it would make a huge impact on support of the community and the people that surround the community and live in the community that are struggling to find and afford their homes."
27,"Would small changes in Positive Effect lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, because a strong effect would occur with the trust of the people and the money that's brought in would influence the small businesses."
28,"Would small changes in Economic Contributions lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, I believe the economic contributions would lead to a strong noticeable change, a big impact in the support of upzoning."
29,"Does Middle class affordability have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Middle class affordability has a positive effect. Middle class, when you say middle class, most likely you're speaking about the majority. Majority of the middle class, the people, will make a positive impact if they're for it."
30,"Is the effect of Public transportation usage on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Absolutely, public transportation and the availability of it would be a huge support for upzoning because one, it brings in business and two, it will help with crowding of cars if you're talking about a building and where the cars would be kept, parking area and so forth. Absolutely, yes, large impact."
31,How confident are you that changes in Utilities lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Well, I don't know for sure if the changes in utility would lead to support of the upzoning. What I do know is if the changes in the utilities are addressed before and put into effect of more housing coming in when they're dealt with not just one building but in the future if you're looking in and building for the future the utilities will be a plus. It will be in support of upzoning because you're saying hey we're prepared if this is something that our community wants to do we are ready and prepared. You can trust in our government. You can trust that we're doing the right thing."
32,What causes changes in Lowering the cost of living? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Yes, lowering the cost of living is an absolute plus, especially when there are people homeless living on the street, or lower middle class people that should be able to afford a home are not able to afford a home, and living with family, living in tents, and living in hotels. Yes, it's a positive, strong positive effect."

Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The economy has a huge effect bringing in the upzoning in support of the upzoning because you're bringing in Like from what I read the upzoning you would have the first floor would be small shops that people could support small Businesses and it brings money to the community It brings the small businesses the people they shop they bring money. They need necessities This requires money which the community of the upzoning from the people living in the homes Can give to the community it is a strong positive
34,How would you describe the relationship between Strong connection and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I don't understand the question.
