Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,you
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?",I think it would impact crime. I think it would detour theft and assault.
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,I think it would lower the crime rate. I think it would impact local businesses and it could even increase local businesses coming to the area because they feel more secure.
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"Now, there are concerns about personal privacy and individual liberties. I do understand that, and I do understand that certain things could be misconstrued, misunderstood, looked at wrongly, not the whole picture taken into effect. That is the down part of it, and, you know, you're looking at 25% chance of something wrongly being viewed, in my opinion. I don't know the exact percentage, but I'm just estimating. The other 75% of the time, you're detouring crime, or you're actually providing evidence to prove crime, and that's what's most important."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"I think it would increase the trust of the community. I think, hey, I mean, there's cameras everywhere anyway. You're being videotaped somewhere, somehow. People have surveillance in the palm of their hand you can be recorded. Why not provide the surveillance that can be used in a court of law, absolutely important, and it would increase trust."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"Boy, this is tough. I say, you're talking regulation of surveying small children could be a problem and misused. And the security of the security would have to be very high. There have to be some intelligent security systems put in place that these can't be broke into, that the local government has control over that and has implementation of strong security measures to protect the security systems."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"Well, I'd say as long as they're put into place that technology is protected, that it can't be hacked, that all of these things are in line, and the percent of the chance of it being hacked being very low, I would say it outweighs the positive of having the system in place. The technology, the availability of viewing and seeing a crime that has occurred, plain in sight of a video, seeing somebody's face, seeing somebody being abused, seeing a car stolen, seeing something being broken into, all these things are important and part of the reason to have the technology."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","I think it would have positive economic effects because businesses would be more trustworthy of the community and the area and feel secure, therefore bringing their businesses into the community."
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"There should be a balance. There should be what do the people want? What does the community want? So if the government wants to put in the surveillance, take it to the people. Vote on it. Bring it to city council. Make an agreement. Have the police bring it into city council or the local judicial system. Bring it into a vote and let the people decide."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,"I don't think much social equity is important. I believe there could be potential bias, but I also believe that the positive of protecting the people with actual visually seeing a crime and protecting people from facial recognition and, you know, wanted people for violent crimes can be captured. It's way more, it outweighs any of that."
11,"What do you think are the main causes of Support for surveillance camera, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I would say the main cause for support for surveillance is trust of the people and safety. Safety and trust, I think, kind of go hand in hand. And the community feels safe. You're going to have increased economy, increased trust, increase of community participation, and it's positive."
12,"Would small changes in Deterring theft lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I do believe that small changes, implementing a few cameras in a few areas of the town, of the community, and showing the people how even in the small area, bringing forward data, showing that the decrease in crime or the actual conviction of the crime in the area, all these data assets and putting all that into a chart or what may be and bringing it to the people would show how important and how good of a system it is. So I think that small steps, a few cameras, bringing in more cameras after that, building the system which would build the trust in the people."
13,How would you describe the relationship between Crime rates and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,It has a positive impact on crime rates and it supports surveillance cameras.
14,"Would small changes in Misinterpretation of Data lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, working out any glitches of any misconstrued data and showing that it's been fixed or if there was a problem and showing how easily it is to adjust it to make it better. These are positive and strong positives."
15,"Would small changes in Increased community trust lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, small changes would increase the community trust or the trust of the people would include would increase support for the surveillance system in a big way."
16,"Is the effect of Protection of children on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, protection of children and showing that it has an aspect of security for the technology, that it can't be hacked, and protecting children is very imminent and a huge positive."
17,"Is the effect of Security of surveillance systems on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe both. I believe it can be an immediate, if you make small changes with just a few cameras, and that would build the trust. So it would take time, but there can be immediate trust because as soon as the camera's installed, you have boom, you have security. Instant security."
18,"Does Strong security measures have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Strong security measures have a positive effect and a huge positive effect. The whole point is for the security and the strong security to protect the community.
19,How confident are you that changes in Reliability of surveillance technology lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I am very confident that if it is proven that the reliability of this surveillance technology is there, then absolutely huge impact and it would make it even a stronger, positive and supportive surveillance capability."
20,"Does Positive economic effects have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","positive economic effects of people bringing their businesses because they feel more secure and You know, it may even lower insurance rates because you're protected From robbery and so forth. So yes, I believe it has a huge impact for support positive support for surveillance surveillance cameras"
21,"Is the effect of Balance between law enforcement and privacy on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, there has to be a balance. We can't have surveillance. The technology, if the technology is reliable, uneditable, then, you know, if it's straightforward, this is it, this is what you see, this is what you get, and this is the proof, yes."
22,"Is the effect of Voter decision-making on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it's imminent.
23,How would you describe the relationship between Crime Prevention and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think crime prevention is the number one support for surveillance cameras, a strong support."
24,"Would small changes in Social Equity lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't know.
25,"Would small changes in Safety lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Absolutely. If the people feel safe, there's trust that's built, which would be in support of surveillance and the trust of the system."
26,"What factors affect Impact on crime, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The factor of proof. Proof of the crime being visually seen. Proof of a facial recognition of a criminal on the run, a violent criminal that could possibly kill you, rape you, maim you, rob you, and that person being caught, that's proof."
