Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"I’d say I’m kinda mixed on this. On one hand, surveillance cameras can help with safety—catching crimes, deterring bad behavior, that sort of thing. So that’s a big plus.
But on the other hand, there’s a real worry about privacy and how the footage might be used or misused. Plus, cameras don’t always solve the root problems and can make some people feel watched all the time, which isn’t great.
So yeah, I support them to some extent—like in spots where safety is a big issue—but I think there should be clear rules and limits to protect people’s privacy too. What about you?"
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","The most significant positive impact is improved safety—cameras can help deter crime, assist police, and make people feel more secure.

On the negative side, they can reduce privacy, create a sense of being constantly watched, and may be used unfairly or lead to over-policing in some neighborhoods."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"Surveillance technologies can definitely help improve public safety by deterring some crimes and making it easier to investigate incidents after they happen. People might behave better if they know they’re being watched.

But the effect on actual crime rates can vary—it might reduce things like theft or vandalism, but not necessarily more serious or hidden crimes. Also, if people don’t trust how the tech is used, it can hurt community relationships with law enforcement."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"Increased surveillance can have a pretty big impact on personal privacy and individual freedoms. When people know they’re being watched, even in public, it can change how they act—like they might feel less free to protest, gather, or just move around without feeling judged."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"Surveillance camera systems can help community trust if they’re used fairly and transparently—like showing they're meant to protect everyone, not just monitor certain groups. That can improve police-community relations by making people feel safer and more supported."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"The government should play a big role in regulating surveillance technologies. It needs to set clear rules on how data is collected, stored, and used—so people’s privacy is protected.

There should be transparency, limits on who can access the footage, and consequences if the tech is misused. Plus, the public should have a say in decisions, especially in their own neighborhoods. So yeah, strong oversight is key to making sure surveillance helps, not harms."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"Technological concerns like accuracy and reliability are super important when deciding on surveillance systems. If the tech isn’t accurate—like misidentifying people or missing important events—it can lead to false accusations or missed threats, which hurts both safety and trust."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","Positive economic effects could include job creation in tech, security, and system maintenance, plus more business confidence if areas feel safer. It might also reduce costs related to crime over time.
Negative effects might be the high upfront costs for installation and upkeep, and possible harm to local economies if people feel uncomfortable or over-policed and avoid certain areas. There’s also the risk of spending big money on tech that doesn’t deliver clear results."
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"The key is transparency and accountability—letting law enforcement use surveillance when necessary, but with clear rules, oversight, and limits. Privacy advocates should have a seat at the table to make sure policies respect civil rights."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,Social equity and bias play a huge role in surveillance tech discussions. These systems can sometimes be used more heavily in certain neighborhoods—often lower-income or communities of color—which can lead to unfair targeting or over-policing.
11,"Would small changes in Safety benefits lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Small changes in safety benefits might cause some increase in support for surveillance cameras, but usually it takes larger, visible improvements—like clear drops in crime or faster police response—to really shift public opinion."
12,"What do you think are the main causes of Support for surveillance camera, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","People mostly support surveillance cameras when they think they make places safer—that's the biggest reason. If they trust the police, support goes up. But if they worry about privacy or feel targeted, support drops. So yeah, safety and trust help, privacy concerns hurt."
13,How confident are you that changes in Crime deterrence lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Pretty confident. When people believe cameras help deter crime, support for them usually goes up—so it's a positive effect.
