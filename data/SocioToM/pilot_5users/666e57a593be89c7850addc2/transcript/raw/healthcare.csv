Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,"I’d say I mostly support universal healthcare. I just think access to basic medical care shouldn’t depend on how much money someone has. Like, people shouldn’t go into debt just because they got sick, you know? Of course, I get that it’s a big system to manage and there are costs, but overall I think it’s the kind of thing that can make a society healthier and more fair."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","One big positive is that more people would actually go to the doctor when they need to, instead of waiting until it’s an emergency—so it could improve overall public health. It could also reduce stress for folks worrying about medical bills. On the flip side, a possible downside might be longer wait times or strain on the system if it’s not funded or managed well. But honestly, the idea of everyone having access to care feels like a pretty solid win overall."
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,"I think universal healthcare would definitely make healthcare more accessible—like, more people could see a doctor without worrying about the cost. That’s a big deal. As for quality, it kinda depends. Some people worry it could go down if doctors are overworked or if funding is tight, but in countries with universal healthcare, the quality still seems pretty good overall. So I guess I’d say accessibility would go way up, and quality could stay solid if the system’s well-run."
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,"That one’s tricky. Some folks argue that universal healthcare might slow down innovation because there’s less profit incentive, especially for big pharma. But honestly, a lot of medical research is already funded by governments and universities, not just private companies. So I don’t think innovation would stop—it might just shift a bit. Plus, if more people are healthier and can participate in trials, that could actually help research in the long run. So yeah, I think the impact might be mixed, but not necessarily negative."
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,"It’d probably ease the burden a lot. Less out-of-pocket costs, no surprise bills. Families wouldn’t have to choose between rent and a hospital visit."
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,"I think the government should make sure everyone has access, and help cover costs. Not do everything, but definitely play a big role."
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,"They matter a lot—if doctors feel overworked or underpaid, that could mess with care quality. Gotta make sure their voices are part of the plan."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?","Positives: people save money, less medical debt, maybe healthier workforce.
Negatives: higher taxes, big upfront costs. It’s a trade-off, really."
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,"It’s tricky but I think both matter. Taxpayers want fair spending, but consumers need good care. So policies should try to keep costs reasonable without cutting people off. Balance is key."
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,"Huge role. If care isn’t fair and equal, the whole system falls short. Access for everyone should be a top priority."
11,"Does Access to medical care have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The effect’s pretty immediate and positive—when people get better access to care, they tend to support universal healthcare more. The effect is pretty strong too."
12,"What factors do you think influence Support for universal healthcare, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","People mostly support universal healthcare if it means easier access and good quality. But if it feels too expensive or slow, support drops. Personal experiences and politics also mess with opinions. Access and cost are the big ones."
13,"Would small changes in Improved public health lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Improved public health definitely has a positive effect on support for universal healthcare. When people see health getting better overall, they’re more likely to back it. I’d say the effect is pretty strong."
14,"Is the effect of Accessibility on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Accessibility has a positive effect on support for universal healthcare, and it’s a pretty strong one. When care’s easier to get, people are way more likely to support the system."
15,How would you describe the relationship between Profit incentive and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I’m kinda unsure, but I think if private innovation drops, support for universal healthcare might dip a little—so a slight negative effect. But it’s probably not super strong."
16,"Is the effect of Economic burden on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Pretty confident changes in economic burden affect support. If people feel less burdened financially, support goes up—a pretty strong positive effect."
17,How confident are you that changes in Universal access to healthcare lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Even small changes in access can boost support, so yeah—it has a positive effect, and I’d say it’s a fairly strong one. People notice when care becomes more available."
18,"Is the effect of Higher taxes on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Doctor workload probably has a negative effect—if people think universal healthcare makes doctors overworked, support might drop. The effect isn't super strong, but it’s noticeable."
19,"Would small changes in Care quality lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Not super confident, but it’s fair to say higher taxes usually lower support for universal healthcare. It’s a negative effect, and it can be pretty strong—people tend to care a lot about out-of-pocket costs."
20,How would you describe the relationship between Fair spending and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Even small changes in perceptions of fair spending can boost support for universal healthcare. It has a positive effect, and while the impact isn’t huge, it’s noticeable—people want to know their money is being used wisely."
21,"Would small changes in Balance as a key principle lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Even small changes in perceptions of fair spending can boost support for universal healthcare. It has a positive effect, and while the impact isn’t huge, it’s noticeable—people want to know their money is being used wisely."
22,"Would small changes in Doctor workload lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Small changes in doctor workload likely wouldn’t shift support much — it would take larger increases in workload for people to notice and potentially decrease support. So, the effect is negative but generally moderate in strength unless the workload becomes a major concern."
23,How would you describe the relationship between Doctor compensation and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"The relationship between doctor compensation and support for universal healthcare is generally weak to moderate. If people believe compensation will be fair, it can have a positive effect by increasing support. But fears of pay cuts could have a negative effect. Overall, the effect is moderate and depends on public perception."
24,How confident are you that changes in Inclusion of healthcare providers in planning lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I’m fairly confident that including healthcare providers in planning has a positive effect on support for universal healthcare. When doctors and nurses are part of the conversation, people feel the system will be more practical and balanced. The effect is moderately strong—it helps build trust and makes the policy feel more workable."
25,How would you describe the relationship between Fairness in Healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The relationship between fairness in healthcare and support for universal healthcare is strong and positive. When people believe the system is fair—meaning everyone gets access regardless of income or status—they are much more likely to support it. The effect is significant because fairness is a core value that resonates across political and social lines.
26,"What factors affect Universal healthcare, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think support for universal healthcare really depends on whether people feel the system is fair and actually helps everyone, not just a few. When folks see it improving access and reducing out-of-pocket costs, they're more likely to back it. On the flip side, worries about higher taxes or overworked doctors can turn people off. Overall, fairness and affordability seem to have the biggest impact on how strongly people support the idea."
27,How would you describe the relationship between Access and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Access and support for universal healthcare are closely linked. When people see that more access means more people getting the care they need, support tends to grow. So, it’s a strong, positive relationship—greater access generally increases support, and that effect is pretty noticeable."
28,"Does Positive effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","A positive effect naturally leads to increased support for universal healthcare.
