# Individual Casual Graph Samples

This repository contains 15  Individual Casual Graph samples representing different demographic perspectives on urban development issues, particularly focusing on upzoning decisions.

## Overview

Each graph models how different stakeholders make decisions about urban density by capturing:
- Key considerations unique to each demographic
- Causal relationships between factors
- How these relationships lead to final positions on upzoning
- Cognitive biases present in decision-making processes

## Sample Descriptions

### Sample 1: Community Resident Perspective

**Decision Structure:**
- Moderately complex network (14 nodes, 17 edges)
- Balances economic concerns (studio affordability) with cultural considerations
- Exhibits mixed stances based on competing priorities (gallery access vs. displacement)
- Emphasizes collective creative identity more than individual impacts
- Cognitive biases: status quo preference with conditional acceptance of change

### Sample 3: Commuter Perspective
Charts how transportation users evaluate development based on transit service, traffic congestion, commute times, and mode choices. Demonstrates links between urban density, transportation options, and commute satisfaction.

**Decision Structure:**
- Detailed transportation-focused network (15 nodes, 18 edges)
- Multiple parallel evaluation paths based on mode choice
- Pragmatic utility-maximizing approach to density evaluation
- Minimal emotional attachment to neighborhood aesthetics
- Less susceptible to status quo bias, more open to change that improves functionality

### Sample 4: Elderly Resident Perspective
Analyzes how older residents prioritize access to healthcare, emergency services, and familiar community resources when evaluating neighborhood change.

**Decision Structure:**
- Moderately complex reasoning (12 nodes, 13 edges)
- Safety and medical accessibility as primary concerns
- Heavy emphasis on predictability and stability in immediate environment
- Shows concern about service disruption during development phases
- Cognitive biases: present bias and heightened loss aversion

### Sample 5: Young Family Perspective
Models decision-making of parents with young children focusing on education quality, safety, and family-friendly amenities.

**Decision Structure:**
- Well-developed network (14 nodes, 17 edges) 
- Multiple evaluation criteria centered on child well-being
- Strong consideration of long-term neighborhood trajectory
- Balances concerns about school crowding with access to family amenities
- Shows willingness to accept density if child-specific needs are addressed

### Sample 6: Low-Income Tenant Perspective
Examines how economically vulnerable residents evaluate development based on affordability, displacement risk, and access to opportunity.

**Decision Structure:**
- Complex vulnerability-focused network (13 nodes, 16 edges)
- Demonstrates economic precarity as central decision factor
- Strong emphasis on tenant protections and anti-displacement measures
- Evaluates development primarily through economic security lens
- Cognitive pattern: acute sensitivity to promises vs. reality gap

### Sample 7: Environmentalist Perspective
Captures how sustainability-focused residents evaluate development through ecological impact, resource efficiency, and climate considerations.

**Decision Structure:**
- Detailed environmental impact network (15 nodes, 19 edges)
- Multiple parallel environmental evaluation criteria
- Demonstrates sophisticated systems thinking about urban ecology
- Values density for efficiency while concerned about green space loss
- Shows principled rather than self-interest driven decision path

### Sample 8: Small Business Owner Perspective
Maps how local entrepreneurs evaluate neighborhood change based on customer base, commercial rents, and business visibility factors.

**Decision Structure:**
- Business viability focused network (13 nodes, 16 edges)
- Practical economic considerations dominate decision structure
- Shows how customer demographics interact with business model
- Balances opportunity from increased foot traffic against rent concerns
- Cognitive pattern: adaptability with pragmatic constraints

### Sample 9: Homeowner Perspective
Models how property owners (often with NIMBY tendencies) evaluate development through property values, neighborhood exclusivity, and perceived status impacts.

**Decision Structure:**
- Property-focused reasoning (12 nodes, 14 edges)
- Strong emphasis on financial investment protection
- Shows status maintenance as significant decision factor
- Clear pattern of social identity preservation reasoning
- Cognitive biases: loss aversion and endowment effect prominently featured

### Sample 10: Elderly Resident (Simplified)
Extremely simplified decision path focused on mobility challenges. Shows straightforward connections between tall buildings, elevator access, and personal mobility needs with minimal decision complexity.

**Decision Structure:**
- Highly simplified linear path (5 nodes, 5 edges)
- Focused exclusively on personal mobility limitations
- Direct causal chain: tall buildings → elevator reliability → personal mobility
- These factors directly determine stance without broader considerations
- Lacks understanding of wider urban planning implications
- Cognitive biases: status quo bias and concreteness bias

### Sample 11: Parent with School-Age Children (Simplified)
Linear single-path reasoning focused exclusively on classroom crowding concerns. Demonstrates tunnel vision where neighborhood density directly impacts school quality and child success.

**Decision Structure:**
- Completely linear single-path thinking (6 nodes, 5 edges)
- Tunnel vision focusing on single factor: children's education
- Simple chain: density → school crowding → class size → education quality → child success
- Catastrophizing thinking, equating development directly with educational decline
- Ignores potential mitigating factors, exhibits zero-sum thinking

### Sample 12: Pro-Density Millennial (Simplified)
Minimal decision structure showing basic supply-and-demand understanding of housing economics. Illustrates oversimplified reasoning that more housing automatically means improved affordability.

**Decision Structure:**
- Minimal logical pathway (4 nodes, 3 edges)
- Oversimplified economic understanding
- Focus solely on supply-demand relationship, ignoring complex factors
- Simplistic understanding of housing construction and affordability
- Cognitive biases: confirmation bias and single-cause fallacy

### Sample 13: Immigrant Family Perspective
Complex network incorporating cultural preservation, community support networks, and multigenerational considerations. Shows how neighborhood attachment forms through interconnected factors of language accessibility, cultural continuity, and family stability.

**Decision Structure:**
- Rich multifaceted network (17 nodes, 21 edges)
- Balances cultural preservation with economic opportunity
- Strong emphasis on mutual support networks and community resilience
- Highlights importance of language accessibility and multigenerational housing
- Demonstrates sophisticated integration of cultural, economic and social factors

### Sample 14: Student Perspective
Decision structure focused on housing affordability, campus proximity, and academic impacts. Links rental costs to study space, part-time work requirements, and ultimately to academic success and graduation timelines.

**Decision Structure:**
- Education-centered network (17 nodes, 21 edges)
- Multiple pathways connecting housing to academic outcomes
- Shows how housing costs affect study environment, work hours, and stress
- Clear prioritization of proximity to campus and transportation options
- Strong connection between housing stability and overall college experience

### Sample 15: Sustainable Business Owner
Integration of business viability with environmental and community values. Maps relationships between urban density, customer foot traffic, transportation options, operational decisions, and alignment with sustainability mission.

**Decision Structure:**
- Sophisticated value-aligned business network (20 nodes, 25 edges)
- Balances profit considerations with environmental commitment
- Shows complex interplay between transportation, carbon footprint and business operations
- Demonstrates how community integration supports business model
- Cognitive pattern: principled approach with practical business constraints
