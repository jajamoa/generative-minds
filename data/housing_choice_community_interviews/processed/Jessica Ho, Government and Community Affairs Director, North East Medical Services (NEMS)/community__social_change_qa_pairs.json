    "question": "Are there communities in San Francisco that are more well-resourced than others?",
    "answer": "Yes, there are communities that are more well-resourced, but it doesn't necessarily correlate with wealth. For example, Seacliff has nice houses and views but lacks nearby amenities like restaurants and transportation. In contrast, Chinatown is well-resourced but many residents live below the poverty level. The goal for people in Chinatown is to move out and find their own space.",
    "category": "Community & Social Change",
    "source_text": "so the question is do I think that there are communities in San Francisco that are more well resourced I mean I would be a fool to say no um I wouldnt say that they have everything that you listed like transportation and public services and restaurants and dining and entertainment all in one area but I definitely think certain areas are more well resourced because of the people who occupy them right and so for instance lets just take a Seacliff for instance right there are no nearby restaurants nearby hair salons nearby cultural centers is just a lot of nice houses and nice views right in the China Beach but um does that mean they want more well researched theres no transportation that goes there really I mean they actually dont want that so I dont know if being more well resourced necessarily translates to a wealthier wealth well-off Place per se whereas lets say Chinatown is extremely well resourced but the people who occupy a lot of units in the Chinatown sros make less than minimum wage less than federal poverty level so does that better I dont I dont think so I think that the point of people coming through Chinatown is not to stay in nsro but to move out and and be able to find their own place in in space and not only physically but you know in the world"

    "question": "How did the Charm City bus program impact Jessica's life in Baltimore?",
    "answer": "The Charm City bus program, started by then-mayor Stephanie Rawlings Blake, provided free bus circulation from where I lived to safer areas like Fells Point and downtown. It allowed me to do my shopping and access things I needed, changing my life significantly. I could run to Fells Point and the harbor and take the bus back when it got dark, which made me feel safer.",

    "question": "What challenges are associated with planning festivals in San Francisco?",
    "answer": "The planning process for festivals can be very difficult, and more festivals would happen if the costs and logistics were not so prohibitive.",
    "category": "Community & Social Change",
    "source_text": "I would say that as someone who helped plan the North Beach Festival this year the planning process can sometimes be very difficult and actually I would think that more festivals would happen if the costs and the logistics were not so prohibitive"
