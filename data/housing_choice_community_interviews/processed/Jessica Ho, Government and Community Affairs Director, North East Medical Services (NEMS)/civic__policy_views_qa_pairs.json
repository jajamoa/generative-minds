    "question": "What are Jessica Ho's views on the housing situation in the Sunset District?",
    "answer": "Jessica Ho believes that the Sunset District has not grown with the times in terms of housing development. She notes that there has been a lack of proposed and approved housing, and while building more housing is part of the solution, the price of housing is also a significant issue.",

    "source_text": "I think the problem with the sunset is that it hasnt changed over the years it hasnt grown with the times um like we I think I mentioned earlier in this interview that in 1880 there were no Realms and in 1980 by then Chinese people could own homes and in between then was a lot of other stories that Im sure youll cover it with your other interviews and I think that now we are in its been 50 years 50 plus years and that I live in one of the newest homes in the sunset that was built in 2000. so I mean that just speaks to how the lack of of growth in the sunset in terms of housing um is where it was the reality we faced today"

    "question": "What are your views on public transportation in San Francisco?",
    "answer": "Public transportation is crucial, but current systems are inadequate. Improvements are needed, such as faster and more reliable services. The Sunset District, in particular, is far from the city's core, making it difficult to access other areas. Better public transportation would greatly enhance the quality of life.",
    "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
    "source_text": "transportation please for the love of God please for the love of God we of our public transportation out there is oh yeah all of it I want faster I and I and I think this is actually very timely because El terrible Im on the board of people peroxide Sunset um I worked for Katie when she was supervisor and we really did not like that plot project or we wanted to make sure that it didnt impact businesses and nems has four sites on terrible uh and yeah it impacts businesses and its terrible and its really something that we cant help because it has to get done but I mean thats the the conundrum right we need better transportation but then do people really have what it takes to endure what all the the construction and changes that need to happen for it to happen right and we just dont know because we havent experienced it yet and we havent at least in my lifetime I would love to take the 28 every day to work but sometimes if I miss the bus its like 10-15 minutes Ill take it back because I dont have a time constraint but you know I I just dont have that or the 7x isnt come back since the pandemic or the NX which I really love those are probably some of my favorite lines the 28x was also great like these rapid lines that are meant to move people around on I think those need to come back to the sunset because we are really far away from the central core maybe of other places that we want to visit in the city its also extremely impossible or extremely difficult if not impossible to get to the southeast side and the mission to public transportation its really just I I tried it doesnt work um I actually think its easier to get to San Jose at this point from the sunset than it is get to the mission because Ive done it because we have a clinic in Lundy which is close to the new Milpitas BART station so I took the 67 bus to the Milpitas BART station to the muni took the N home and I was within like an hour and a half and I couldnt do that for from getting the sunset to the mission like I could technically take the end down to downtown and then transfer but like its just a security circuitous way right whereas like driving does in fact take less time which unfortunately is why you know if theres no parking out there either which is its a conundrum its all difficult so I think public transportation would be a really great asset to the Sunset and there are a lot of people for better for worse that dont drive who live in the sunset and really rely on buses like my husband I share a car so at least we have that um but and I really like the scooters those are really cool and all other alternative ways of um biking or skating or however people get to where they need to go but it also is nice just to have a workable public transportation system it can really change the quality of life"

    "question": "What improvements does Jessica suggest for new buildings in San Francisco?",
    "answer": "I would recommend that new buildings be built with elevators because there are no elevators in the Sunset, and as people age, getting up those stairs is not easy. Movable chairs that go up and down stairs don't seem like a long-term solution.",
    "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
    "source_text": "I would say for the purposes of this question if I could recommend anything that you guys as planning could do to improve our lives it would be whatever new buildings are built to build elevators in them because theres no elevators in the sunset and as people age getting up those stairs are not easy and so Ive seen a lot of people use these these like movable chairs that kind of move up and down the stairs but its not doesnt seem very uh like a long-term suit it doesnt seem like a long-term solution"

    "question": "What is Jessica's idea of affordable housing?",
    "answer": "My idea of affordable housing is that someone can afford housing by paying 30% of their income on it. I think we make it difficult sometimes, but it's not a difficult concept.",
    "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
    "source_text": "my idea of affordable housing is someone who can afford housing I mean its not that difficult concept I think we make it difficult sometimes but its if we really want to just look at the data um whoever someone may like whoever you ask whatever they make um find out what they make and make them pay 30 of their costs on housing and I would consider that affordable housing"

    "question": "What are Jessica's views on building heights and smart growth in San Francisco?",
    "answer": "I would like to see smart growth along the transit corridors. We have an opportunity to grow along Irving, Noriega, Taraval, and parts of Judah and Lawton. However, we need to ensure there is enough transit to serve the increase in people. I don't think 50-story buildings near the ocean are a good idea due to environmental factors and the possibility of the area becoming the beach.",
    "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
    "source_text": "I would like to see smart growth along the transit corridors I think that we already have an opportunity to do that because the Zoning for Irving and Noriega and Taraval I think even parts of Judah and Lawton we havent reached those high intensity limits yet so theres already room there to grow along Transit corridors I think the caveat is do we have enough transit to serve the increase in people who live in those Transit corridors and around those Transit corridors but I also think that if we could make it easier for seniors to go up and down I dont see why we cant increase the heights of most of our buildings and just have maybe four stories not necessarily I dont think I think 50 stories near the ocean where its expected to be under the ocean at some point is maybe not the best planning choice not only because it may not I dont know like factors of wind and rust and you know how the ocean eats things but also there theres a high possibility that it may be the beach soon so I dont know if thats really the smartest plan but I do think that there are ways to increase density in a Smart Way in the sunset district for sure"
