      "question": "What challenges did Jessica face when she first moved to Baltimore?",
      "answer": "When I first moved to Baltimore, I lived on the hospital campus, which was one of the worst places in Baltimore. I didn't have a car, and I didn't know how to survive there. I ate pretzels out of the vending machine because every restaurant, even in the hospital, closed at 10 pm. I couldn't get quarters to do my laundry because the bank closed earlier than I expected. It was a pretty dangerous area, and it was not uncommon to be attacked.",

      "question": "How did the Charm City bus program impact Jessica's life in Baltimore?",
      "answer": "The Charm City bus program, started by then-mayor Stephanie Rawlings Blake, provided free bus circulation from where I lived to safer areas like Fells Point and downtown. It allowed me to do my shopping and access things I needed, changing my life significantly. I could run to Fells Point and the harbor and take the bus back when it got dark, which made me feel safer.",

      "source_text": "Stephanie Rawlings Blake the current the then mayor of Baltimore started the charm bus program Charm City bus program and where she would just have buses circulate for free from where I live to Fells Point to Federal triangle hill whatever Federal Hill and to the to the to the downtown area and it just circulated every you know so I was able to take the bus down to places that I felt safer in and do my shopping and and get access to things and it changed my life it really did like I dont know what I would do it without that bus system and I would sometimes run and I could you know because running is safer than walking so I could run to Fells Point and the harbor and then take the bus back when it got dark and I felt safe that way"

      "question": "What improvements does Jessica suggest for new buildings in San Francisco?",
      "answer": "I would recommend that new buildings be built with elevators because there are no elevators in the Sunset, and as people age, getting up those stairs is not easy. Movable chairs that go up and down stairs don't seem like a long-term solution.",
      "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
      "source_text": "I would say for the purposes of this question if I could recommend anything that you guys as planning could do to improve our lives it would be whatever new buildings are built to build elevators in them because theres no elevators in the sunset and as people age getting up those stairs are not easy and so Ive seen a lot of people use these these like movable chairs that kind of move up and down the stairs but its not doesnt seem very uh like a long-term suit it doesnt seem like a long-term solution"

      "question": "Why did Jessica choose to move to San Francisco?",
      "answer": "I came to San Francisco because I felt free and able to express myself in ways I couldn't in other places. I think that might be the case for other people as well, and it adds to the uniqueness of San Francisco.",
      "category": "Race, Gender, and Identity",
      "source_text": "I came to San Francisco because I felt of the way I felt free and able to express myself in ways I couldnt express myself in other places I think that might be the case for other people as well so I think that in that sense were always going to hopefully attract like-minded people who are more open-minded maybe than people who are just the general population and I think that does add to the um uniqueness of San Francisco"

      "question": "What role do community events play in San Francisco according to Jessica?",
      "answer": "Community events like festivals, public libraries, and large festivities such as Chinese New Year, Pride, and the North Beach Festival celebrate the uniqueness of different cultures and people in San Francisco. They help show who we are, what we value, and what we want in life.",
      "category": "Community & Social Change",
      "source_text": "I think the events like the festivals um the community events things that are open to the public our public libraries everything that our city tries to make accessible to people including large festivities like for Chinese New Year like um just the Han for the philam community like Pride like you know the North Beach Festival these are all just some examples of events that really celebrate the uniqueness of different cultures and different people and different ideas in San Francisco and I think thats a its its really nice to see that I think that thats really helps show not only ourselves but others who we are and what we value and what we like and what we what we want in life"

    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with planning festivals in San Francisco?",
      "answer": "The planning process for festivals can be very difficult, and more festivals would happen if the costs and logistics were not so prohibitive.",
      "category": "Community & Social Change",
      "source_text": "I would say that as someone who helped plan the North Beach Festival this year the planning process can sometimes be very difficult and actually I would think that more festivals would happen if the costs and the logistics were not so prohibitive"

      "question": "What is Jessica's idea of affordable housing?",
      "answer": "My idea of affordable housing is that someone can afford housing by paying 30% of their income on it. I think we make it difficult sometimes, but it's not a difficult concept.",
      "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
      "source_text": "my idea of affordable housing is someone who can afford housing I mean its not that difficult concept I think we make it difficult sometimes but its if we really want to just look at the data um whoever someone may like whoever you ask whatever they make um find out what they make and make them pay 30 of their costs on housing and I would consider that affordable housing"

      "question": "What are Jessica's views on building heights and smart growth in San Francisco?",
      "answer": "I would like to see smart growth along the transit corridors. We have an opportunity to grow along Irving, Noriega, Taraval, and parts of Judah and Lawton. However, we need to ensure there is enough transit to serve the increase in people. I don't think 50-story buildings near the ocean are a good idea due to environmental factors and the possibility of the area becoming the beach.",
      "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
      "source_text": "I would like to see smart growth along the transit corridors I think that we already have an opportunity to do that because the Zoning for Irving and Noriega and Taraval I think even parts of Judah and Lawton we havent reached those high intensity limits yet so theres already room there to grow along Transit corridors I think the caveat is do we have enough transit to serve the increase in people who live in those Transit corridors and around those Transit corridors but I also think that if we could make it easier for seniors to go up and down I dont see why we cant increase the heights of most of our buildings and just have maybe four stories not necessarily I dont think I think 50 stories near the ocean where its expected to be under the ocean at some point is maybe not the best planning choice not only because it may not I dont know like factors of wind and rust and you know how the ocean eats things but also there theres a high possibility that it may be the beach soon so I dont know if thats really the smartest plan but I do think that there are ways to increase density in a Smart Way in the sunset district for sure"
