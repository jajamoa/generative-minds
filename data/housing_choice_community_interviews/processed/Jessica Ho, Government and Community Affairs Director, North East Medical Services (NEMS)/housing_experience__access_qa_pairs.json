    "question": "How does the availability of affordable housing affect the social dynamics in San Francisco?",
    "answer": "The availability of affordable housing changes the dynamic of people living in San Francisco because we spend time with those closest to us geographically. Now that the pandemic is over and activities are in person, physical proximity influences relationship building. Where you live affects how you live your life, shaping San Francisco's culture and views on children and families.",
    "category": "Housing Experience & Access",
    "source_text": "e South Bay to the north however they can find affordable housing and I think that does change the dynamic of people who are living in San Francisco just because as anyone knows we we spend our time with the people who are closest to us geographically and now that the pandemic is over and were doing things in person if youre not physically there youre not going to build the same type of relationship with someone as if you were physically there so I think where you live does make a difference in how you live your life so I do think that where you live will or where people live will definitely shape and influence how San Franciscos culture becomes and also how we see and view Children and Families and I think its actually a story yet to be seen I think were still writing it as we as we speak"

    "question": "What challenges do renters face in San Francisco?",
    "answer": "Renting is difficult because newcomers to the city don't have the privilege of rent control, leading to outrageous prices. Even though some prices have come down during the pandemic, paying rent is seen as paying down someone else's mortgage, which is not beneficial in the long run.",
    "category": "Housing Experience & Access",
    "source_text": "sure um so I renting is difficult because is a person whos trying to come in the city we dont necessarily have the privilege of rent control or rent control prices per se and so um theyre a little outrageous and I know that Ive heard some of the prices have come down through the pandemic which is great but yeah I think once no matter if youre paying a thousand or two thousand or even 5 000 for rent um my familys philosophy is if youre paying rent to someone else youre paying down their mortgage and not paying on your own which over time its just not going to be a beneficial thing for you"

  {
    "question": "Why did you decide to buy a home in San Francisco?",
    "answer": "I always knew I wanted to buy a place because paying a mortgage benefits you in the long run. Initially, I didn't think I had enough funds, but after attending a finance literacy event and speaking with financial counselors, I was inspired to think creatively about achieving my goal. With my parents' experience in real estate, we developed a plan, applied for a loan, and eventually bought a home.",
    "category": "Housing Experience & Access",
    "source_text": "so thats why its always better in our opinion to buy a home because whatever we pay to the mortgage company eventually does benefit us so thats why I always knew I would want to buy a place but when I started looking I didnt think I had enough funds because I had you know just started a new job and wasnt really didnt I mean I tried saving but you know its hard in these times and I actually went to just randomly because I used to intern for Carmen too she had when she was an assessory quarter this uh like Finance literary event in like this South East quadrant of San Francisco like somewhere in the Bayview I think and I was like all right well Ill come to support like Carmen but um not that interested or live in the Bay View but I went and they made you sit down with financial counselors and theyre asking you questions Im like look Im just here to volunteer I dont know what you want me to do like well youre here so like lets talk about your finances Im like okay and Im like hes like whats one of your reach dreams like I would love to buy a home hes like why dont you do it now Im like well because I dont have enough funds and hes like lets like think about that right and be creative with what you have and how you want to achieve that goal and start your plan today and because of that I think it really inspired me to like think about it because I was like no Im not I was 31 at the time I was like Im not gonna buy a home like no one else though I dont know anyone else whos who has a home in San Francisco like Ive already bought a place in Sacramento but thats like you know very very different prices at that point so yeah like I didnt really think about it um but I talked with my parents who Ive you know have um a lot of experience in real estate and we came up with a plan and figured out you know what I could potentially get in a mortgage we applied for a loan which was a long process but at the time we had really good interest rates I think thats not the case right now but I was able to lock in a very good uh interest rate and um after that first phase is complete and you have the financing I think then the rest is just finding the house"

  {
    "question": "What challenges did you face when buying a home in San Francisco?",
    "answer": "We faced challenges such as being outbid on offers, with homes selling for much higher than the asking price. It was a seller's market, so buyers couldn't ask for contingencies, and many homes were sold as-is, often in poor condition. Additionally, many homes in the Sunset had unpermitted in-laws, which was a concern.",
    "category": "Housing Experience & Access",
    "source_text": "and so we went to maybe like 20 open houses um all around the sunset District I even looked at places outside the sunset District that were potentially cheaper like Ingleside um the Portola like I looked at other locations but um we put down three offers and every time we put on an offer at that time we were completely outbid and it was like ridiculous that I think there was one that was listed for 1.2 million dollars and you know of course you want to put something better than that but then it eventually got sold for 1.6 million cash and so were like theres no way that we would have been able to compete with that um and I think another really difficult situation at least when I was buying in 2020 was that because it was a sellers market the buyers really couldnt ask for any contingencies if the the house was in complete dilapidated state they wouldnt do anything to fix it it would be sold as is you wouldnt know really sometimes about the structure of the house and why theyre selling it they would just have to take it at face value like you wouldnt know if you inherited like a ticking Time Bomb so that was always a concern a lot of the homes in the sunset are unpermitted there were a lot of unpermitted um houses that have in-laws which automatically excluded my interest because I didnt want to go through the planning process of of right um writing that process so yeah that was also a problem too"

    "question": "What does living in the Sunset District mean to you?",
    "answer": "Understanding what the Sunset means to me is hard to verbalize; it's more of a feeling than something I can explain. When I first moved into my place on 29th Avenue, I felt for the first time like I could be myself and breathe, a feeling I've never had anywhere else.",
    "category": "Housing Experience & Access",
    "source_text": "I think understanding what the sunset means to me is a hard thing to verbalize because as with maybe other people I its more of a Feeling more than something I could really explain I think theres just this magical feeling and Im not usually into Im Im a pretty scientifically minded person so I I typically like to follow up my statements with reasoning and um but when it comes to where you live and personal choices like who you love those are things that you cant really explain logically sometimes and I think thats kind of what the sunset is to me its when I first when I first moved in to my place um our place in 23 34 29th Avenue I felt for the first time like I could be myself and I could breathe and Ive never felt that anywhere else"

    "question": "What challenges did Jessica face when she first moved to Baltimore?",
    "answer": "When I first moved to Baltimore, I lived on the hospital campus, which was one of the worst places in Baltimore. I didn't have a car, and I didn't know how to survive there. I ate pretzels out of the vending machine because every restaurant, even in the hospital, closed at 10 pm. I couldn't get quarters to do my laundry because the bank closed earlier than I expected. It was a pretty dangerous area, and it was not uncommon to be attacked.",
