      "question": "What challenges does San Francisco face in building more housing?",
      "answer": "There are plenty of places where you could build more housing, but the bureaucracy is insane, making it difficult to get anything done. Projects often face opposition, and while some objections are reasonable, others are not. Despite the need for 80,000 units by 2030, the current rate of progress makes this goal seem unattainable.",

      "source_text": "nd I see it a lot I think there are plenty of places where you could build more housing um there are all sorts of times when Im driving around the city when Im going different places where I see Big Lots that are sat back in forever and I just oftentimes wonder why theyre still in the making um San Francisco Im gonna start working for the city I kind of knew this to an extent beforehand but I feel like just the bureaucracy and of everything here is just insane and it is insane to get everything done to get anything done almost like its just it has to jump through so many hoops and then obviously there are some crazy things like that um the skyscraper that theyre proposing over by the zoo that is just like nuts but there are a lot of things where it can win on a lot of different fronts and one that I can think of is um right next to the giant stadium that one that theyre building where its kind of like everybody signed off on it right because it hit all the right notes um Ill just feel like people need to its a give and a take and a lot of people need to give ground and just come to a commonality where stuff can get done because I believe its 80 000 units that supposedly were supposed to build by 2030 at the rate that things are going I see no way that thats going to happen because every project that you hear of you have people fighting it and then sometimes you know theyre kind of crazy and sometimes theyre pretty reasonable but it doesnt matter theres always going to be people that are fighting it but I mean from my perspective there are plenty of spots where we can build just everybody needs to come in agreement that it has to happen"

      "question": "What is the importance of housing for first responders in San Francisco?",
      "answer": "It would be beneficial to have housing priced specifically for first responders and city workers, as many are moving out due to high costs. If a disaster occurs and first responders have to commute from outside the city, it could be problematic. Allocating funds for down payments could make working for the city more enticing.",
      "category": "Housing Experience & Access",
      "source_text": "I think what were referring to kind of like in in first responder middle class type of range it would be nice if they made housing that was priced specifically tailored towards people that are in a certain demographic percentage which I dont see too much its usually theyre very low or very high um and housing for First Responders maybe not necessarily like a community of housing but like setting some aside to have First Responders reside there otherwise theres a lot of people that are just going to continue to move out that work for the city specifically First Responders and as we were talking about earlier if there is a disaster and we dont have any First Responders and they have to commute all the way in here whos to say somethings not wrong with the bridge somethings not wrong with our things youre stuck here with you know a way less amount of First Responders and that could be a disaster in the making so also just the importance of people that work in for the city reside and in the city I think that is very important and maybe for city workers its a whole you know having some money allocated to you towards put towards a down payment something along those lines to make it more enticing to work for the city"
