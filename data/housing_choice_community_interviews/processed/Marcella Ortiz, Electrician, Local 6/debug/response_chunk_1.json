They decided to save more money and eventually received guidance from a family friend to navigate the home-buying process.",
      "category": "Housing Experience & Access",
      "source_text": "so we moved back to my parents house and we saved and we were saving and saving saving and um we had uh you know a pretty good chunk of money saved and we had to ask ourselves um what do we want to do you know do we want to save to buy a house where do we want to live first right we wanted to stay in San Francisco and everybody said youll never be able to buy a house in San Francisco like literally people say you will never buy a house in San Francisco um and so anyway uh we we knew we wanted to stay in San Francisco so our options were um save up to buy a market rate house or to try to um get a below market rate house with my brother bought a below market rate house through the um San Francisco housing authority in that agency or we can just rent and be renters um my mom always instilled in me ever since I was younger that it was just kind of like we had to buy a house and it was instilled in us at a very young age that was just something that you did my husband grew up differently my husbands mom was an immigrant from Mexico my my husbands an immigrant he came from Mexico when he was one years old hes been here for 32 years so hes you know pretty much American but um you know his you know he comes from a place where youre just trying to make it you know owning a home anywhere is you know you just theres no conversation about that but since were coming from different economical backgrounds I was like hey lets try to do this you know so we saved up um and we try to get a below market rate house so we went to every single class we went to the one-on-one the 101 Council we we went to all the classes we went to the one-on-one Council the uh consultant where they give you a counselor then we submitted all the paperwork I had a big binder like this of all my taxes all my my pay stubs all Martins pay stubs everything and then we figured out that okay with the amount of much money I make and he makes were we will only qualify for like 100 media income so that means that all these houses you know only a set few are for 100 medium income right so we said screw it like we come this far with this Pro process lets just try right after you do all this work then you can uh get into a lottery right like so we do all this work and now its just a lot bait Lottery based right so we get in the lottery but while youre going to through the lottery you have to try to find lender right or even to get into a lottery you have to have lenders and you can only go with the specific lenders that that San Francisco housing authority gives you right so my husband has a federal tax ident number he doesnt have a social hes in the process of getting his social were in the Pro doing that whole process but theres no banks there was only one bank that will allow him to be on the loan and if youre getting a below market rate house every single person whos over 18 has to be on the loan so that means if youre a family of a family trying to get a home with a below market rate housing and you have you have your your first son is 18 just turned 18 and then your daughters 16 another daughters 14 that 18 year old has to be on the loan that means his income bumps up your median income even if hes working at Taco Bell and so I just I I dont know if thats fair um anyway so uh make the long story short we we went through that whole process which was extremely um we were pulling out our hair we were just you know it was a hard process to go to and I am English is my first language I graduated high school I went to a little bit of college I would say that Im you know an educated person and it was hard for me so I know that if somebody is English is a second language or is a mom a single mom or a single parent they will not have time to do that that whole process so anyway um uh we did the whole thing and then we couldnt get a lender we couldnt get a lender so even if we won the lottery we won we were out of the drawing um so the only other option and maybe it was a godsend was to buy a home in San Francisco so were like all right well we have to save up more so we saved up my parents were like cool with it right theyre all like whatever you know if you guys paying rent you could save stay and save and thats a blessing a lot of people who are in San Francisco and you know you know young families young couples you know they dont have a place to sit and stack and save you know um so weve we finally saved up a good chunk and then uh my my best friends mom um Rocio um her her mother Leticia Luna she owns a lot of property in San Francisco and she says when youre ready Ill hook you up with the right people and I hooked up with her lady and she guided me through the process and the lady was like Hey look everybodys gonna say that you cant afford this everybodys gonna say you cant do this everybodys gonna say its not worth it but if you look at the numbers its worth it and I just I just stuck with the people who done it you know and so it gave me confidence you know"
