    "question": "What is your view on the cost-effectiveness of preventing homelessness?",
    "answer": "A little bit of money when someone's about to become homeless or about to leave would be much more cost-effective than having the person become homeless. Giving them five thousand dollars to help with two months of rent is much cheaper than having to care for a person when they become homeless.",

    "source_text": "I also think that we need to really stop like a little bit of money when someones about to become homeless or about to leave would really be so much more cost effective than having the person become homeless so like its like that long like stepping back and looking like this like okay yes you might be giving them five thousand dollars to help with two months of rent but thats much cheaper than having to Care House feet like all of these things for a person when they become homeless"

    "question": "What is your stance on the current affordable housing policies?",
    "answer": "I don't understand why we have to make someone stay in a certain income bracket for affordable housing. If they need help, help them, but don't force them to stay at an income level to keep this housing. It makes no sense and keeps people down.",
    "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
    "source_text": "I know an issue that I deal with a lot is that you know we provide vouchers or housing for employee or for people here in the city and like with my non-profit Im trying to get these girls like head and if they make too much money they lose their housing thats messed up were keeping people down like I cannot I dont understand that so she cant work more because then she loses her housing but the housings not really that good so she doesnt want to work more because theres like rats in it and her like peoples like thats not a good house for her especially when shes a recovering addict like she shouldnt be there she shouldnt be in that location but thats the only house that we can give her but if she tries to do better she loses that there is something messed up in that whole scenario that is really you know I am dealing with a non-profit who houses women coming out of prison and they dont want to work with me anymore because Im getting them out of that house too quickly and theyre losing some of their funding so theres theres something wrong thats like way bigger that needs to be fixed as far as budgeting and how we allocate money and who we allocate the money to and like if someone qualifies for affordable housing do we really need to make sure that they continually like because if theyre going to be able to move out they probably want to move out a millionaire is not going to try to live in affordable housing and if they do props you know like I just dont understand why we have to make someones like stay in a certain bracket for affordable housing that makes absolutely no sense to me like if theyre in it and they need help they need help help them but dont force them to stay at an income level to keep this housing that seems ridiculous to me and I dont think I think if we allowed the people who are in the affordable housing to stay in affordable housing and still build a better income bracket the like actual affordable housing might become better because these people would have money to actually put into their house to improve it or their living situation to improve it and who wouldnt want to do that I mean look at us as humans we want to be comfortable you know why not help people do that its ridiculous you shouldnt have to you know what I am sure that it wants youre in a spot where you can move out you will move out exactly yeah and I mean its not wire we keep on like I just cant I dont"

    "question": "What issues do you see with the current parole and housing policies?",
    "answer": "If a family of an incarcerated person is in Section 8 Housing and the person gets out of jail, visiting their family violates parole and they lose the Section 8 housing. This policy doesn't make sense and keeps families apart.",

    "source_text": "or you know if um a family of an incarcerated person is in Section 8 Housing and the person gets out of jail if they want to go see their family it actually violates the parole and they lose the Section 8 housing as well its really dumb so like are we just supposed to keep families like that doesnt even make sense to me I understand if they need to maybe move to a different Section 8 housing that has a different Schnoodle schwarf with the snorf you know that I get but to just lose housing because you want to see someone that you havent seen in the while is not good"
