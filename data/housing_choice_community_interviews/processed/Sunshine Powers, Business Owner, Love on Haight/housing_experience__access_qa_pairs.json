    "question": "How does Sunshine Powers support her employees' housing needs?",
    "answer": "Sunshine offers a housing credit to employees who have been with the company for over six months, and she has housed employees in apartments above the shop.",
    "category": "Housing Experience & Access",
    "source_text": "were now offering a housing credit to anyone thats been here for over six months because I cant at this point provide affordable housing for them all I would like to um but that doesnt mean that I should treat other people differently if I cant like because I get a housing credit if they live above the shop and I might as well give the people that dont live above the shop that same housing credit because thats fair"
