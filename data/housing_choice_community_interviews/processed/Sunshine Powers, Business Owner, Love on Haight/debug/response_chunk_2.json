      "question": "How has the housing crisis affected the community in the Haight area?",
      "answer": "The housing crisis has changed the Haight over the years, shifting the community. Long-term residents being forced to leave takes away the sparkle that is part of the Haight. We are a tight-knit community and it's hard on us when one of them has to leave because rent goes up or some ridiculous thing is happening.",

      "source_text": "the hate has changed over the years because of the housing crisis so be it shifts the community and like people like whove only been here for five years they really freak out about stuff and its like yeah man you need a few more years on you like literally I had someone complaining about the doom and Loom thing of the city and I was like you werent here in the 80s whats going on like this is great uh its like the cycle that we go on as a city like its gonna and um but the idea that some of the long-term residents are forced to leave it takes away that Sparkle that is part of the hate we are a community here more than any place I have ever lived we are like this tight-knit community and we take care of each other we take care of our neighbors and its really hard on us when one of them has to leave because rent goes up or some ridiculous thing is happening that doesnt make sense"

      "question": "What is your view on the cost-effectiveness of preventing homelessness?",
      "answer": "A little bit of money when someone's about to become homeless or about to leave would be much more cost-effective than having the person become homeless. Giving them five thousand dollars to help with two months of rent is much cheaper than having to care for a person when they become homeless.",
      "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
      "source_text": "I also think that we need to really stop like a little bit of money when someones about to become homeless or about to leave would really be so much more cost effective than having the person become homeless so like its like that long like stepping back and looking like this like okay yes you might be giving them five thousand dollars to help with two months of rent but thats much cheaper than having to Care House feet like all of these things for a person when they become homeless"

      "answer": "A thriving community is one where people use the community as much as possible, where you can get everything you need and feel safe. You know your neighbors, and everyone does their part. It's about community involvement and support.",
      "category": "Community & Social Change",
      "source_text": "my idea of a thriving Community is honestly going back to what I said before people that really use the community as much as possible I wanted to open up a shopping Union Square like I love Union Square I want to help Revitalize it it needs more rainbows why not but I was like is there a way I can link up with some sort of affordable housing here because Im not gonna open up a shop if I cant get laid Im not asking for free housing Im asking for affordable housing Im asking for like where everyone can live together maybe walk home so they feel safe and all that like little other action you have to have food and grocery stores clutch you have to have parking if its not a walkable neighborhood and the reality is that you should have some parking we have keys our stadium so like theres some sort of parking area and there should be that that is its not good on peoples human existence have to find a parking spot for like two hours thats just not safe and if theres any way that there could be um secured you know so you dont have to worry about getting your stuff broken into total side random your dad kind of thing I went to the dead and Co show and they had a truck that had um stored your stuff like they searched it but it was a locker thing I dont know why we cant do that in the neighborhood so like people who are traveling can put their stuff in there and not have to worry about their car being broken into that seems very logical to me but sorry not what we were talking about dude Im just thriving no thats right just the writing Community is what like what it looks like in terms of resources in terms of a driving Community as a place that you can get everything that you need and you feel safe that you know that you know not only do you know your beat cops not only do you know your police ambassadors your community ambassadors but you know your neighbor you know your neighbors name um if you need an egg you can go you know grab to the grocery store or knock on your neighbors door like when the 89 earthquake happened and I was in the Richmond District everyone came out in the street and we all like had our gassed up like our little campfire stoves and we all cooked for each other you know my dad wasnt located for like eight hours and the neighbors made sure our gas was turned off like they made sure we were taken care of so San Francisco has always had this community"

      "question": "What is your stance on the current affordable housing policies?",
      "answer": "I don't understand why we have to make someone stay in a certain income bracket for affordable housing. If they need help, help them, but don't force them to stay at an income level to keep this housing. It makes no sense and keeps people down.",
      "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
      "source_text": "I know an issue that I deal with a lot is that you know we provide vouchers or housing for employee or for people here in the city and like with my non-profit Im trying to get these girls like head and if they make too much money they lose their housing thats messed up were keeping people down like I cannot I dont understand that so she cant work more because then she loses her housing but the housings not really that good so she doesnt want to work more because theres like rats in it and her like peoples like thats not a good house for her especially when shes a recovering addict like she shouldnt be there she shouldnt be in that location but thats the only house that we can give her but if she tries to do better she loses that there is something messed up in that whole scenario that is really you know I am dealing with a non-profit who houses women coming out of prison and they dont want to work with me anymore because Im getting them out of that house too quickly and theyre losing some of their funding so theres theres something wrong thats like way bigger that needs to be fixed as far as budgeting and how we allocate money and who we allocate the money to and like if someone qualifies for affordable housing do we really need to make sure that they continually like because if theyre going to be able to move out they probably want to move out a millionaire is not going to try to live in affordable housing and if they do props you know like I just dont understand why we have to make someones like stay in a certain bracket for affordable housing that makes absolutely no sense to me like if theyre in it and they need help they need help help them but dont force them to stay at an income level to keep this housing that seems ridiculous to me and I dont think I think if we allowed the people who are in the affordable housing to stay in affordable housing and still build a better income bracket the like actual affordable housing might become better because these people would have money to actually put into their house to improve it or their living situation to improve it and who wouldnt want to do that I mean look at us as humans we want to be comfortable you know why not help people do that its ridiculous you shouldnt have to you know what I am sure that it wants youre in a spot where you can move out you will move out exactly yeah and I mean its not wire we keep on like I just cant I dont"

      "question": "What issues do you see with the current parole and housing policies?",
      "answer": "If a family of an incarcerated person is in Section 8 Housing and the person gets out of jail, visiting their family violates parole and they lose the Section 8 housing. This policy doesn't make sense and keeps families apart.",

      "source_text": "or you know if um a family of an incarcerated person is in Section 8 Housing and the person gets out of jail if they want to go see their family it actually violates the parole and they lose the Section 8 housing as well its really dumb so like are we just supposed to keep families like that doesnt even make sense to me I understand if they need to maybe move to a different Section 8 housing that has a different Schnoodle schwarf with the snorf you know that I get but to just lose housing because you want to see someone that you havent seen in the while is not good"
