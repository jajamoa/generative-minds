    "answer": "Ariana suggests more loans for first-time home buyers, better management and distribution of taxes towards housing, and more open-mindedness around diversifying the city.",
    "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
    "source_text": "I know that we have a program in place for firsttime home buyers in the city which really creates an amazing opportunity but that isnt enough based on the budget that they have for the majority of people in the city that do not make an income that matches the the needs of match it doesnt match the pricing of the housing market and so Id love to see more loans like that that were put in place Id love to see um I guess more of an attempt to manage and kind of disperse taxes that were paying towards housing because we pay very very steep expensive taxes in the city and we dont really see it reflected in how they provide affordability in housing um Id love to see there be more agreement and cohesiveness among people that are kind of preventing development in neighborhoods that they are trying to preserve um and more opened more open-mindedness around diversifying a city that really used to be extremely diverse and inclusive"
