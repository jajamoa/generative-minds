      "question": "What are your thoughts on the public transportation system in San Francisco?",
      "answer": "I really like Muni because it is convenient and runs frequently. However, BART should run more often, especially during peak times when buses are crowded. Overall, San Francisco does a good job with transportation, and I rely on public transit a lot.",

      "source_text": "usually I would drive but more recently Ive been like taking Bart and the muni I really do like the moon because it is really convenient and it does run really frequently so awesome sometimes yeah most of the time it does run pretty frequently but I do feel like the BART should run more because its like every like 15-20 minutes um and the bus um I feel like they probably should have a little bit more buses because especially like around where people around the time people get off school and work and everything is super crowded its like probably and everything um and but I feel like San Francisco um does do a good job of like the transportation um for me I usually rely on public transit since I live across the city from where I go to school yeah so Im I use public transit a lot"

      "question": "What are some challenges you face with the Muni system?",
      "answer": "Sometimes it is difficult to get on a bus, especially the 29, which is slow. There are issues with reliability and safety on Muni, but they are making progress with outreach and improvements.",
      "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
      "source_text": "I personally rely on like the 29 for example and I know it goes from like the baby all the way up to all the way through the sunset to like um to like Richmond where Washington is and theres a lot of kids who rely on the route and sometimes it is difficult to get on a bus but um I definitely agree with Ariana where I think Community is um or I guess to rephrases I think Muni is doing um quite a good job especially compared to like a lot of other cities um if you look at like a Muni map where you see that its we have routes throughout the city um and yeah were all like connected to the financial district downtown on the downtown area um yeah and I like especially like as someone who like serves on their youth Transit Advisory Board I see that theyre making a lot of progress too in terms of trying to do more Outreach to young people trying to alleviate some of the issues that um still exists on uni yeah but once again like I think theyre doing a pretty good job of connecting our city um yeah and I guess to speak on the other side of things I think theres still definitely are issues that um could be improved um on with Muni in terms of like reliability just getting more writers to um ride Muni and in terms of safety on Muni"

      "question": "What are your thoughts on biking in San Francisco?",
      "answer": "I think biking across the city is a great way to get to destinations, but it is expensive. There should be a push to make biking more affordable for youth, and the city should incentivize companies to make bikes cheaper.",
      "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
      "source_text": "I think if anything thing Id like to talk more about like riding bikes around the city I think with so many more like bike Lanes being added and like with JFK being closed now I think thered be more of like a push for bikes I know like theres like lift wheels and theres like bay wheels which is um a program that allows to rent out bikes for like I think minutely pay but I think there should be like a more push for the city to actually like incentivize these companies to come in and like make their bikes cheaper because I think biking across the city is a great way to get to like destinations but it is really expensive for example the other week I rode for 90 minutes and it was 30 dollars so it was pretty bad but I love biking and I think biking should be more affordable for all the youth around our city and also I guess different neighborhoods down our city"

      "question": "How does the public transit system in San Francisco compare to other American cities?",
      "answer": "Muni is pretty good compared to other American cities where public transit isn't as good. Getting to downtown from any part of SF is nice, but routes to residential neighborhoods like the Sunset or Richmond can be slow.",
      "category": "Civic & Policy Views",
      "source_text": "yeah I totally agree with you guys that uh Muni is pretty pretty good when uh in America oh and comparing it to like other American cities a lot of times the public transit isnt that good so Im very appreciative that we have the muni system but yeah uh I noticed that getting to downtown like basically any quarter at any uh part of SF getting to downtown is pretty uh nice but then like from my from my experience in my area like going to the sunset or the Richmond uh I have to catch the 29 and it takes quite a while and then also like if I want to go to like Bayview um the 54 or like the 44 isnt as reliable so like the ones that go to the residential neighborhoods arent that great but its its still possible and then downtown is very nice"

      "category": "Community & Social Change",
      "source_text": "I can kind of start so I went to school at Marina middle school and also I go to Galileo now so its like in that little District where its like kind of the marina and I always say that the marina is so like there are a lot of like nice resources there for the community members but I will say the same type of really like applicable to my neighborhood like for example they have the whole like Moscone Park its really nice um the people that run it are also really nice theyre part of like I think the Rex and Parks team but I also say their neighbor theres like libraries are really nice and its really close to the water which is I guess you cant really have that in mind neighborhood because mines like Nautica all close to the water but its like the whole neighborhood in general just theres so many like nice like like I dont know wide streets and theres like theres a lot of like nice I guess like trees and like bushes like that where I cant like say the same thing for my neighborhood but I will say that like after like going to school there for so long Ive like noticed a drastic change between the two neighborhoods"
