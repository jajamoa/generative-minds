uh  Patrick  Allen  Deputy  probation

officer  for  San  Francisco

I  was  born  and  raised  in  San  Francisco

um  lived  here  the  majority  of  my  life

um

worked  for  the  city  for  10  years

full-time  now  maybe  13  years  part-time

and  I  still  reside  here  most  of  my  life

is  around  San  Francisco  so

my

moms  dad  my  grandfather  immigrated  here

maybe  in  the  40s  from  Ireland

um  my  parents  died

same  thing  maybe  a  bit  earlier

um

both  my  parents  born  and  raised  in  the

sunset  districts

I  still  reside  out  there  now

I  mean  the  sunset  is  great  its  got  a

great  community  of  people  theres  people

that  are  Generations  residing  there

right

um

I  live  next  to  Ocean  Beach  I  love  Ocean

Beach  Ive  been  surfing  since  my  teenage

years

um  Im  an  avid  Runner  San  Francisco  is  a

great  running  City  I  enjoy  the  great

Highway  being  closed  on  the  weekends  and

running  in  that  running  through  Golden

Gate  Park  running  down  JFK

um

theres  a  lot  of  great  food  out  there

the  neighborhood  has  really  developed

when  I  was  growing  up  it  was  just  like

Irish  pubs  and  Chinese  restaurants  I

guess  like  a  few  and  far  between  but  now

it  has  turned  into  you  know  a  place  with

a  real

diverse  Network  restaurants  and  places

to  go  theres  actually  stuff  to  do  out

there

um

but  its  just  a  very  homey  neighborhood

um

man  Ive  been  living  there  for  the  past

like

10  years  now  I  lived  in  the  Excelsior

before  which  was  also  a  really  cool  kind

of  feels  like  its  one  of  the  work  the

last  working-class  neighborhoods  in  San

Francisco

but  you  know  a  lot  like  with  the  sunset

and  the  Excelsior  you  find  a  lot  of

people  that  are  Generations  living  there

and  people  that  have  pride  in  their

neighborhood  which  is  really  cool  you

know  a  lot  of  people  that  grew  up there

rather  than  a  lot  of  people  that

transplanted  over  him

uh  I  mean

Ive  traveled  all  over  the  world  been  to

a  lot  of  places

and  sometimes  you  have  to  leave  San

Francisco  to  come  back  and  actually

appreciate  it  for  what  it  is  I  mean  it

is  a  world-class  city

um

I  was  riding  my  bike  around  the  Presidio

the  other  day  on  a  beautiful  morning  and

just  looking  out  over  the  water  into  the

Marine  Headlands  and  everything  and  I

just  think  like  people

from  all  over  the  world  look  around

searching  for  something  like  this  and

sometimes  you  know  you  forget  that  you

have  that  in  your  own  backyard

um

youre  such  an  Eclectic  mix  of  people

here

um  so  much  to  do

its  just  such  a  beautiful  city  and  I

think  we  have  a  lot  of  problems  that

need  to  be  solved

but  at  the  same  ends  you  know

the  national  Narrative  of  San  Francisco

doesnt  really  describe  but  people  that

grew  up  here  and  take  pride  in  our  city

and  love  it  we  know  what  we  have  here

its  a  beautiful  city  but

so  much  going  on  but  you  know  theres  a

lot  to  solve  at  the  same  time  but  I

would  never  give  up  on  this  city  you

know

currently  I  ran

um

pretty

thats  what  Im  looking  for  Im  pretty

lucky  pretty  fortunate  that  I  have  a

friend  that  rents  me  a  place  at  a  pretty

decent  rate  its  Ive  kind  of  found  that

a  lot  of  people  that  grow  up  in  San

Francisco  how  youre  able  to  stay  here

and  afford  stuff  A  lot  of  times  if

youre  working  a  job  or  youre  not

making  an  insane  amount  of  money  is  to

kind  of  just  have  family  and  friends

that  are  able  to  help  you  out  one  way  or

the  other  I  mean  I  think  when  I  was

growing  up  I  couldnt  have  imagined  how

much  expensive  housing  would  get  here

um

you  know  maybe  when  I  was younger  I

didnt  realize  it  as  much  but  it  seemed

like  there  were  a  lot  more  working-class

families  there  are  a  lot  more  families

period  in  San  Francisco  a  lot  more  kids

um

and  you  know  the  past  man  I  dont  know

15  years  something  like  that  like  you

just  see  everything  exploding  its  like

you  know  any  anytime  I  look  into

purchasing  something  its  just  so

daunting  because

everythings  so  expensive  I  looked  at  an

earthquake  Shack  that  was  built  after  19

the  1906  earthquake  in  the  sunset

because  I  want  to  keep  residing  in  the

neighborhood  that  I  grew  up in  I  want  to

be  a  part  of  the  community  still  stuff

like  that  they  were  asking  eight  hundred

thousand  dollars  for  something  that  is

one  bedroom  one  bath

and  that  was  bigger  than  this  room  to  be

honest  and  I

probably  couldnt  afford  that  and  then

even  when  I  asked  the  realtor  after  she

said  it  went  for  70  something  thousand

dollars  over  that  800  000  asking  thing

so  I  mean  housing  here  is  still  critical

and  I  think  for

middle  class  earners  if  theyre  even  his

middle  class  anymore  people  that  work

for  the  city  doing  jobs  such  as  myself

youre  kind  of  stuck  between  a  rock  and

a  hard  place  because  you  dont  make

enough  money  to  buy  a  home  outright  but

you  do  not  qualify  for  many  things  that

will  give  you  assistance  to  purchase  a

home  because  technically  they  make  too

much  money  so

and  its  its  a  weird  place  to  be  in  to

be  honest  and  frustrating  for  sure  have

you  seen  like  many  of  your  co-workers  is

that  something  that  youll  discuss  is

the  ones  that  Ive  had  to  leave  if

theyre  going  to  these  farther  up  places

and  theres  other  places  and  you  know  I

mean  Petaluma  Sacramento  and  then

commuting  right  yeah  exactly  what  youre

saying  and  I  see  some  people  Tracy  I

mean  crazy  places  where

I  mean  the  toll  on  yourself  commuting

every  day  like

I  couldnt  imagine  it  so  I  suck  it  up

and  I  pay  my  rent  here  not  only  because

I  want  to  live  in  San  Francisco  but  I

just  cant  imagine  living  that  far  and  I

see  how  difficult  it  is  for  people  that

grow  up  here  that  live  so  far  away  now

and  commute  every  day  its  just  its

daunting  its  tough  parents  were

fortunate  enough  to  purchase  our  house

in  1979  I  think  when  you  know

obviously  stuff  was  much  more  attainable

so  Im  fortunate  to  have  them  stay  here

and  you  know  and  be  able  to  see  them  a

lot  um

I  know  my  sister  had  to  move  away

because  she  couldnt  really  afford  a

place  that  she  would  have  wanted  in  San

Francisco  shes  not  too  far  away  but

shes  out  of  the  city

um  my  extended  family  the  majority  of

them  have  moved  away  a  lot  of  cousins

everyones  buying  and  conquered

Sacramento

like  youre  saying  Petaluma  so

places  that  are  far  out  of  the  city  my

friend  group  a  lot  of  people

same  thing  Nevada  Petaluma  places  where

like  a  nice  house  and  a  nice  Community

is  more  attainable

um

a  lot  of  times  just  people  cannot  afford

a  house  here  in  the  community  that  they

grew  up in  no  matter  what  neighborhood

it  is  it  just  seems  like  everybodys

priced  out

personally  I  think  as  a  first  responder

like  you  know  I  work  with  the  community

on  a  daily  basis  and  I  find  it  important

to  reside  in  San  Francisco  because  not

only  is  my  own  family  here  but  I  intend

on  just  setting  Roots  here  I  intended

being  here  for  the  long  term  and  I  like

living  in  the  community  that  I  work  with

um

Im  not  afraid  of  seeing  anyone  that  I

deal  with  on  a  daily  basis  within  the

community  because  I  treat  everyone  with

respect  dignity  and  the  way  that  I

wouldnt  want  to  be  treated

so  I  also  think  its  important  when

youre  working  with  people  that  reside

in  the  community  to  live  there  as  well

theres  a  sort  of  mutual  respect  between

that

especially  for  people  that  were  born  and

raised  here  that  still  reside  here  I

think  people  recognize  that  for  sure  and

you  think  that  builds  like  a  sort  of

trust  between  the  department  or  First

Responders  and  the  community  by  you

being  able  to  live  here

I  think  it  definitely  helps

especially  in  my  job  just  relating  to

people  and  understanding  the  problems

the  Dynamics  within  San  Francisco  that

we  can  can  relate  on  that  level  but  also

being  a  first  responder  if  there  was  a

disaster  to  happen  here

you  can  respond  quickly  rather  than  if  I

went  and  bought  a  house  45  minutes  to  an

hour  away  from  here  and  had  to  respond

during  that  time  frame  during  this

disaster

tough  you  know  seconds  matter  during  a

situation  like  that  and  if  you  can  be  in

San  Francisco  and  respond  right  away

youll  actually  be  able  to  help

for  us  for  probation  like  I  always  say

that  if  youre  on  probation  in  San

Francisco

you  have  every  option  to  be  successful

if  you  want  it  and  that  includes  housing

we  have  multiple  different  places  that

we  can  provide  people  housing  for  that

are  coming  involved  with  the  justice

system  here  so  theres  a  lot  of  options

with  that  but  I  mean  at  the  same  time  I

see  people  struggle  for  sure  some  people

that  you  know  they  dont  want  to  take

the  housing  options  because  there  is

stipulations  such  as  a  curfew  and  stuff

like  that  theres  rules  that  you  got  to

abide  by  and  understandably  if  someone

has  a  family  you  know  they  want  to  live

with  their  family  so

you  know  I  have  guys  that  work  in  the

trades  that  maybe  work  in  Hospitality

that  its  kind  of  just  the  same  I  try  to

help  them  as  much  as  possible  but  I  have

some  people  that  are  grinding  you  know

trying  to  make  an  honest  living  trying

to  walk  a  straight  line  and  not  go  back

to  the  path  that  they  were  walking

before

and  you  know  its  tough  for  them  when

you  got  a  family  of  four  or  five  and  you

got  to  provide  for  them  its

its  its  hard  to  make  a  living  here  no

doubt  to  live  here  and  make  a  living  is

tough

I  mean  from  my  vantage  point  personally

speaking  like

whatever  middle  class  there  is  nowadays

honestly  I  think  are  the  ones  that  are

overlooked  so  were  talking  about

firefighters  police  officers  probation

officers  teachers

plumbers  electricians  people  that  are

making  money  that  would

be  classed  as  middle  class  in  San

Francisco  whatever  that  is  because

everythings  astronomical  here  but  I

feel  like

theyre  the  people  that  get  the  short

end  of  the  stick  on  a  lot  of  things

because  theres  just  when  we  talk  about

a  hundred  percent  affordable  housing  who

is  it  affordable  for  because  as  I  was

alluding  to  earlier

technically  I  make  too  much  money  to

qualify  for  that  affordable  housing  but

on  the  other  Spectrum

I  cant  afford  anything  else  because

its  like  I  dont  make  enough  money  to

get  other  things  so  people  in  my

situation  is  kind  of  what  how  who  I  feel

for  and  what  I  think  about  a  lot  when  we

talk  about  people  getting  squeezed  out

of  San  Francisco  obviously  people  of  all

demographics  you  know  all  neighborhoods

are  but  definitely  people  in  my  position

its  just  relatable  to  myself  and  I  see

it  a  lot

I  think  there  are  plenty  of places

where  you  could  build  more  housing

um  there  are  all  sorts  of  times  when  Im

driving  around  the  city  when  Im  going

different  places  where  I  see

Big  Lots  that  are  sat  back  in  forever

and  I  just  oftentimes  wonder  why  theyre

still  in  the  making

um

San  Francisco  Im  gonna  start  working

for  the  city  I  kind  of  knew  this  to  an

extent  beforehand  but  I  feel  like  just

the  bureaucracy  and  of  everything  here

is  just  insane  and  it  is  insane  to  get

everything  done  to  get  anything  done

almost  like  its  just  it  has  to  jump

through  so  many  hoops  and  then

obviously  there  are  some  crazy  things

like  that  um  the  skyscraper  that  theyre

proposing  over  by  the  zoo  that  is  just

like

nuts  but  there  are  a  lot  of  things  where

it  can  win  on  a  lot  of  different  fronts

and  one  that  I  can  think  of  is

um right  next  to  the  giant  stadium  that

one  that  theyre  building  where  its

kind  of  like  everybody  signed  off  on  it

right  because  it  hit  all  the  right  notes

um

Ill  just  feel  like  people  need  to

its  a  give  and  a  take  and  a  lot  of

people  need  to  give  ground  and  just  come

to  a  commonality  where  stuff  can  get

done  because

I  believe  its  80  000  units  that

supposedly  were  supposed  to  build  by

2030  at  the  rate  that  things  are  going  I

see  no  way  that  thats  going  to  happen

because  every  project  that  you  hear  of

you  have  people  fighting  it

and  then  sometimes  you  know  theyre  kind

of  crazy  and  sometimes  theyre  pretty

reasonable  but  it  doesnt  matter  theres

always  going  to  be  people  that  are

fighting  it  but

I  mean  from  my  perspective  there  are

plenty  of  spots  where  we  can  build  just

everybody  needs  to  come  in  agreement

that  it  has  to  happen

um  I  think  what  were  referring  to  kind

of  like  in

in  first  responder  middle  class  type  of

range  it  would  be  nice

if  they  made  housing  that  was  priced

specifically  tailored  towards  people

that  are  in  a  certain  demographic

percentage  which  I  dont  see  too  much

its  usually  theyre  very  low  or  very

high

um

and

housing  for  First  Responders  maybe  not

necessarily  like  a  community  of  housing

but  like

setting  some  aside  to  have  First

Responders  reside  there  otherwise

theres  a  lot  of  people  that  are  just

going  to  continue  to  move  out  that  work

for  the  city  specifically  First

Responders  and  as  we  were  talking  about

earlier  if  there  is  a  disaster  and  we

dont  have  any  First  Responders  and  they

have  to  commute  all  the  way  in  here

whos  to  say  somethings  not  wrong  with

the  bridge  somethings  not  wrong  with

our  things  youre  stuck  here  with

you  know  a  way  less  amount  of  First

Responders  and  that  could  be  a  disaster

in  the  making  so

also  just  the  importance  of  people  that

work  in  for  the  city  reside  and  in  the

city  I  think  that  is  very  important  and

maybe  for  city  workers  its  a  whole  you

know  having  some  money  allocated  to  you

towards  put  towards  a  down  payment

something  along  those  lines  to  make  it

more  enticing  to  work  for  the  city

all  right  San  Francisco  has  an  addiction

problem  but  its

blatant  anyone  who  spends  time  here

spends  time  downtown  when  youre  in  my

position  unfortunately  you  see  a  whole

lot  of  it

um  we  go  in  the  field  a  couple  times  a

week  checking  on  our  clients  trying  to

help  people  and  just  unfortunately  its

a  day-to-day  reality  of  being  here

um

treatment  a  lot  of  people  need  treatment

and  then  I  mean  personally  I  think  like

tiny  home  Villages  you  know  with  social

workers  counselors  drug  detox  all  sorts

of  things  that  are  in  play  for  them

there  and  then

like  here

this  is  the  cast  Community  assessment

resource  center  and  we  provide

everything  that  anyone  is  on  probation

could  need  so  you  have  access  to  jobs

you  have  access  to  treatment  here  um  we

have  access  to  our  housing  which  is

funded  through  our  department

you  can  get  individual  therapy  you  can

get  a  case  manager  we  have  five  keys  if

you  need  to  get  your  high  school  diploma

GED

um  does  she  support  the  word  stuff  here

you  can  get  lunch  here  every  day  so  I

mean  there  is  a  lot  of  things  out  there

but  we  as  a  city  need  to  do  better  of

trying  to  take  care  of  most  of  the

people  that  are  struggling  do  you  have

an  idea  of  where  most  of  the  people  that

you  deal  with  on  a  daily  basis  come  from

that  are  having  to  experience  probation

like  which  neighborhoods  what

neighborhoods  yeah

um

I  mean

the  tenderloin  for  sure  I  mean  Soma

um

those  are  a  large  demographic  of  people

to  deal  with  um  Unfortunately  they  deal

with  a  lot  of  transient  people  theyre

struggling  with  substance  abuse  issues

and

its hard  to  get  them  into  housing

because

from  my  perspective  its  housing  isnt

going  to  solve  the  homeless  issue

because  people  need  treatment  as  well

um  Ive  seen  that  firsthand  where

you  can  get  a  person  a  room  but  it

doesnt  mean  theyre  going  to  stop  using

and  unfortunately  you  know  youve  seen  a

lot  of  sros  that  people  are  overdosing

and  passing  away  in  these  sros  so  there

needs  to  be  kind  of  some  oversight  with

people  as  well

I  mean  in  terms  of  housing  like  yeah

affordability  we  create  on  all  levels

being  able  to  own  a  home  here  without

really  struggling  to  get  it  done

um

but  hopes  for  San  Francisco  just  to

clean  up  some  of  the  problems  we  have

help  people  that  need  it  and

just  continue  to  push  towards  being  the

great  City  that  we  are  weve  always  been

known  as  a  world-class  City  and  I  feel

like  the  reputation  here  has  taken  a  hit

in  recent  years

and  Im  really  hoping  that  thatll

bounce  back  tourism  keeps  growing  we

keep  bringing  in  money  to  the  city

and  just  good  things  keep  happening

because  I  know  that  the  city  is  capable

of  it  like  I  said  the  people  that  grew

up  here  we  take  a  lot  of  pride  in  that

so
