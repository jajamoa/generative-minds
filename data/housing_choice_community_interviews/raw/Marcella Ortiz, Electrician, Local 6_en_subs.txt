Im  Marcella  Ortiz  Im  born  and  raised

in  San  Francisco  Im  a  electrician  for

local  six  I  work  for  San  Francisco  power

um  I  come  from  a  long  line  of

electricians  inside  of  Wireman  from  for

that  worked  in  San  Francisco

and  yeah

so  both  of  my  parents  were  born  in  San

Francisco  and  then  I  believe  on  my

mothers  side

her  mother  was  actually  born  in  San

Francisco  and  then  her  mothers

you  know  I  think  its  like  my  great

grandparents  came  and

um

and  uh  and  then  my  fathers  side  he  was

born  in  San  Francisco  and  then  my

grandfather  came  from  Texas

and  um

he  came  and  uh  and  he  lived  in  Texas

until  until

we  traced  back  and  my  familys  roots  and

started  in  Texas  so

um  yeah  I  think  they  were

like  in  Texas  when  they  were  it  was

still  Mexico  probably

but  yeah  so  they  came  over  my

grandfather  was  looking  for  work  and

came  and  he

um  settled  in  the

Day  Street  area  now  they  call  it  the  Noe

Valley  but  he  lived  on  28th  and  what

20th  in  church  for  my  whole  life  and

then

um  he  actually  got  evicted  when  he  was

in  his  80s  and  after  he  got  evicted  he

died  a  couple  months  later

um  and  uh  we  my  parents

they  got  married  they  met  in  San

Francisco  they  were  both  City  kids  they

met  they  got  married  they  bought  a  house

in  the  Sunnyside  area  kind  of  by  like

you  know  um  City  College  area

and  thats  where  I

um  I  spent  the  majority  of  my  life  well

into  my  adulthood  we  lived  in  uh  in  on

one  two  two  Detroit  Street  it  was  a

single  family  dwelling  unit

um  and  since  I  was  one  years  old  it  was

me  my  mom  my  dad  and  my  two  brothers  so

there  was  five  of  us  and  it  was  a

um  it  was  like  a  two-bedroom  like  a  very

it  was  a  shack  you  know  I  remember  it

before  they  remodeled  it  when  I  was  like

15.  my  both  my  parents  worked  so  um  they

both  were  electricians  my  mom  too  so

they  were  able  to  afford  to  save  up  and

Remodel  and  extend  the  house  and  do  all

that  stuff

but  for  a  long  time  up  until  I  was  like

15  it  was  about  two  bedroom  and  it  was

like  five  of  us  living  in  in  that

you  know  a  small  house

they  did  they  bought  the  house  in  the  18

in  in  the  80s  in  the  80s  1989

and  do  you  remember  was  there  process

difficult  buying  a  house  like  did  they

have  any  barriers  or  you  also  remember

how  much  they  paid  for  the  house  I  think

they  paid  a  hundred  and  no

how  much  do  they  pay

they  paid  like

I  dont  want  to  mess  it  up  but  they  paid

something  like

like  not  that  much  like  I  want  to  say

like  a  hundred  thousand  dollars  or

something  like  that  and

um  it  wasnt  hard  for  them  to  buy  the

house  I  think  they  were  a  little  a

little  bit  short  on  the  down  payment  and

then  my  grandfather  like  lent  them  some

money  there  wasnt  an  issue  in  the  loan

loan  process

um

um  it  was  a  very  quick  thing  and  then  I

feel  like  now  the  house  is  worth  like

2.5  because  they  extended  it  out  and

theres  people  knocking  out  the  door

leaving  leaving  things  on  the  door  if

you  know  asking  them  if  they  want  to

sell  and  and  um  so  its  kind  of  crazy

its  one  of  those  its  one  of  those

neighborhoods  that  got  really  expensive

over  the  time  like  when  we  grew  up  it

was  just  like  basketball  hoops  on  the

corner  of  you  know  the  light  poles  and

it  was  a  fam  it  was  so  many  kids  you

know  there  was  kids  in  the  neighborhood

um  and  then  you  know  slow  slowly  but

surely  As  Time  passed  it  was  just  like

you  know  the  Mercedes  moved  in  and  the

Porsche  moved  in  and

um  the  families  kind  of  were  moving  out

different  different  demographic  was

coming  in  the  area  and



um

you  know  no  one  really  talks  to  each

other  back  when  I  grew  up  everybody  all

the  neighbors  knew  each  other  you  know

um

so  yeah

and  where  did  you  move  to  next  after

your  family  home

so  I  was  with  my  family  I  met  my  my

husband  now  and  we  bounced  around  I  mean

we  we  rented  a  home  through  a  family

friend  who  was  like  extremely  generous

renting  is  like  house  like  two-bedroom

house  for  like  1600  bucks  in  the  Portola

um that  of  course  came  to  an  end  because

he  was  gonna  wanted  to  do  something  with

that  then  we  we  moved  to  like  Hunters

Point  we  rented  like  a  room  that

shouldnt  probably  by  law  not  even  have

been  on  the  market  for  a  room  it  was

extremely  small  it  was  like  it  just  was

like  it  was  like  not  up  to  code  or

anything  you  know

um  and  then

um  we  moved  back  and  forth  to  my  my  my

parents  house  and  his  parents  his  mom

lived  in  the  mission  he  he  she  lived  in

um  a  um

an  apartment  in  the  mission  and

um  there  was  always  a  bunch  of  people  in

that  apartment

um  but  finally  me  and  my  husband  said

hey  like  we  gotta  figure  out  what  were

gonna  do  financially

um I  know  we  wanna  we  wanna  just  do

Playhouse  and  do  this  whole  uh  you  know

lets  move  out  and  do  our  thing  but

were  lets  be  realistic  do  we  want  to

stay  in  San  Francisco  if  we  want  to  stay

in  San  Francisco  and  we  want  to  be  on

our  own

we  had  to  you  know  make  a  choice  so  we

moved  back  to  my  parents  house  and  we

saved

and  we  were  saving  and  saving  saving  and

um  we  had  uh  you  know  a  pretty  good

chunk  of  money  saved  and  we  had  to  ask

ourselves

um

what  do  we  want  to  do  you  know  do  we

want  to  save  to  buy  a  house

where  do  we  want  to  live  first  right  we

wanted  to  stay  in  San  Francisco  and

everybody  said  youll  never  be  able  to

buy  a  house  in  San  Francisco  like

literally  people  say  you  will  never  buy

a  house  in  San  Francisco

um  and  so  anyway  uh  we  we  knew  we  wanted

to  stay  in  San  Francisco  so  our  options

were

um  save  up  to  buy  a  market  rate  house  or

to  try  to

um get  a  below  market  rate  house  with  my

brother  bought  a  below  market  rate  house

through  the  um San  Francisco  housing

authority  in  that  agency  or  we  can  just

rent  and

be  renters

um  my  mom  always  instilled  in  me  ever

since  I  was  younger  that  it  was  just

kind  of  like

we  had  to  buy  a  house  and  it  was

instilled  in  us  at  a  very  young  age  that

was  just  something  that  you  did  my

husband  grew  up  differently  my  husbands

mom  was  an  immigrant  from  Mexico  my  my

husbands  an  immigrant  he  came  from

Mexico  when  he  was  one  years  old  hes

been  here  for  32  years  so  hes  you  know

pretty  much  American  but  um  you  know  his

you  know  he  comes  from  a  place  where

youre  just  trying  to  make  it  you  know

owning  a  home  anywhere  is  you  know  you

just  theres  no  conversation  about  that

but  since  were  coming  from  different

economical  backgrounds

I  was  like  hey  lets  try  to  do  this  you

know  so  we  saved  up

um  and  we  try  to  get  a  below  market  rate

house

so  we  went  to  every  single

class

we  went  to  the  one-on-one  the  101

Council  we  we  went  to  all  the  classes  we

went  to  the  one-on-one  Council  the  uh

consultant  where  they  give  you  a

counselor  then  we  submitted  all  the

paperwork  I  had  a  big  binder  like  this

of  all  my  taxes  all  my  my  pay  stubs  all

Martins  pay  stubs  everything  and  then

we  figured  out  that  okay  with  the  amount

of  much  money  I  make  and  he  makes  were

we  will  only  qualify  for  like  100  media

income  so  that  means  that  all  these

houses  you  know  only  a  set  few  are  for

100  medium  income  right  so  we  said  screw

it  like  we  come  this  far  with  this  Pro

process  lets  just  try  right  after  you

do  all  this  work  then  you  can  uh  get

into  a  lottery  right  like  so  we  do  all

this  work  and  now  its  just  a  lot  bait

Lottery  based  right  so  we  get  in  the

lottery  but  while  youre  going  to

through  the  lottery  you  have  to  try  to

find  lender  right  or  even  to  get  into  a

lottery  you  have  to  have  lenders  and  you

can  only  go  with  the  specific  lenders

that  that  San  Francisco  housing

authority  gives  you  right  so  my  husband

has  a  federal  tax  ident  number  he

doesnt  have  a  social  hes  in  the

process  of  getting  his  social  were  in

the  Pro  doing  that  whole

process  but  theres  no  banks  there  was

only  one  bank  that  will  allow  him  to  be

on  the  loan  and  if  youre  getting  a

below  market  rate  house  every  single

person  whos  over  18  has  to  be  on  the

loan  so  that  means  if  youre  a  family  of

a  family  trying  to  get  a  home  with  a

below  market  rate  housing  and  you  have

you  have  your  your  first  son  is  18  just

turned  18  and  then  your  daughters  16

another  daughters  14  that  18  year  old

has  to  be  on  the  loan  that  means  his

income  bumps  up  your  median  income  even

if  hes  working  at  Taco  Bell

and  so  I  just  I  I  dont  know  if  thats

fair

um  anyway  so  uh  make  the  long  story

short  we  we  went  through  that  whole

process  which  was  extremely

um  we  were  pulling  out  our  hair  we  were

just  you  know

it  was  a  hard  process  to  go  to  and  I  am

English  is  my  first  language  I  graduated

high  school  I  went  to  a  little  bit  of

college  I  would  say  that  Im  you  know  an

educated  person  and  it  was  hard  for  me

so  I  know  that  if  somebody  is  English  is

a  second  language  or  is  a  mom  a  single

mom  or  a  single  parent  they  will  not

have  time  to  do  that  that  whole  process

so  anyway

um

uh  we  did  the  whole  thing  and  then  we

couldnt  get  a  lender  we  couldnt  get  a

lender

so  even  if  we  won  the  lottery  we  won  we

were  out  of  the  drawing

um  so

the  only  other  option  and  maybe  it  was  a

godsend  was  to  buy  a  home  in  San

Francisco

so  were  like  all  right  well  we  have  to

save  up  more  so  we  saved  up  my  parents

were  like  cool  with  it  right  theyre  all

like  whatever  you  know  if  you  guys

paying  rent  you  could  save  stay  and  save

and  thats  a  blessing  a  lot  of  people

who  are  in  San  Francisco  and  you  know

you  know  young  families  young  couples

you  know  they  dont  have  a  place  to  sit

and  stack  and  save  you  know

um  so  weve  we  finally  saved  up  a  good

chunk  and  then  uh

my  my best  friends  mom

um  Rocio

um  her  her  mother  Leticia  Luna

she  owns  a  lot  of  property  in  San

Francisco  and  she  says  when  youre  ready

Ill  hook  you  up  with  the  right  people

and  I  hooked  up  with  her  lady  and  she

guided  me  through  the  process  and  the

lady  was  like  Hey  look  everybodys  gonna

say  that  you  cant  afford  this

everybodys  gonna  say  you  cant  do  this

everybodys  gonna  say  its  not  worth  it

but  if  you  look  at  the  numbers

its  worth  it  and  I  just  I  just  stuck

with  the  people  who  done  it  you  know  and

so  it  gave  me  confidence  you  know

um  so  we  started  looking  for  homes  and

we  started  you  know  house  shopping  right

and  me  and  my  husband  will  walk  into

some  of  these  homes  you  know  if  you  go

to  different  parts  of  the  country  and

people  are  selling  their  house  and

um  you  know  Nevada  or  something  the

agent  will  welcome  you  and  try  to  sell

the  house  and  be  a  good  salesperson  not

in  San  Francisco  they  are  on  their  phone

theyre  on  the  computer  and  they  dont

care  who  coming  because  they  know  they

dont  need  to  even  do  any  work  you  know

um  my  husband  actually  got  kicked  out

once

my  husband  they  said  excuse  me  sir  like

this  is  an  open  house

um  we  need  you  to  leave

I  said  were  here  to  look  at  the  home  we

we  have  we  have  money  like  we  have

enough  money  to  purchase  this  home  you

know  and  um

it  was  like  they  didnt  even  believe  us

so  I  dont  have  to  you  dont  have  to

read  the  through  the  lines  to  say  that

the  the  to  buy  a  home  its  just

extremely  you  have  to  be  like  you  know

Rich  you  know  um  anyway  so  um  we  finally

found  a  home  in  Hunters  Point  right  on

Third  and  Revere

um

it  was  a  rough  neighborhood  but  it  still

sold  for  1.1  and

um  we  got  the  we  got  it

I  called  my  brother  I  said  I  need  to

hold  I  need  to  borrow  10.  my  mom  and  my

dad  they  helped  us  out  with  another  20

and  with  the  money  that  we  saved  we  had

enough  we  had  enough

and  so  we  got  it  and  I  was  like  the

happiest  day  of  my  life  you  know

um

because  uh  everybody  told  me  that  we

couldnt

you  know  everybody  told  me  that  we

werent  never  gonna  be  able  to  do  it  and

so

um

yeah  it  was  uh  thats  my  story  right  so

now  I  have  two  girls  and  me  and  my

husband  we  are  able  to  provide  them  with

the  roof  over  their  heads  and

um

yeah  it  was  a

it  was  a  it  was  a  stressful  a  very  very

stressful  experience  not  knowing  where

were  going  to  live  theres  been  times

um  where

you  know  that  stress  of  not  not  where  am

I  going  to  live  where  am  I  gonna  where

am  I  gonna  go  you  know  like  thank  God

that  I  had  my  parents  a  lot  of  people

dont  have  their  parents  you  know  a  lot

of  people  dont  have

um

that  that  um

its  a

its  a  its  a  privilege

yeah  you  know  a  lot  of  people  dont  have

that  privilege  and  they  just  they  got  to

get  it  out  on  their  own  and  its  hard

if  we  want  to  change  the  housing  dynamic

in  San  Francisco  and  make  it  equal  I

mean  I  feel  like  its  never  going  to  be

equal  because  its  always  theres  so

much  money  coming  into  San  Francisco

theres  always  going  to  be  that  that

that  uh  the  the  market  rate  housing  its

always  going  to  be  like  for  sharks  you

know  I  get  that  but  if  San  Francisco

wants  to  do  affordable  housing  they  need

to  implement  a  better  program  thats

actually  a  that  that  people  are  actually

able  to  do  you  know  like  my  brother  got

a  below  market  rate  house  when  he  got  it

when  he  was  26  years  old  and  he  um  got

it  when  it  was  like  the  the  the  program

had  just  started  it  was  like  three  years

old  and  there  was  not  a  lot  of  it  was  a

relatively  easier  process  to  go  through

and  um  he  was  able  he  was  able  to  do  it

but  um

you  know

um

now  this  is  another  thing  about

the  below  market  rate  homes  in  the

affordable  housing  its  like  another  big

thing  is  that  once  you  get  into  a  below

market  rate  home  youre  owning  that  home

but  youre  not  really  youre  not  really

because  youre  gonna  pay  youre  gonna

pay  for  it  youre  gonna  pay  for  it  and

then  at  the  end  youre  gonna  you  know

you  paid  off  your  loan  but  then  you  can

have  your  house  but  what  happens  when

you  die  they  tell  you  in  the  me  they

tell  you  you  learn  that  when  you  die

the  the home  can  go  to  your  kids

only  if  they  make  that  medium  income

and  that  income  is  going  to  change  to

the  years  so  if  your  children  dont  make

enough  or  make  too  much  then  its  going

to  be  taken  away  from  them  and  they  will

be  pushed  out  you  will  not  be  able  to

you  know  build  generational  wealth  for

your  family  you  will  not  be  able  to  give

your  kids  anything  so  thats  another

thing  its  like  are  we  is  affordable

housing  to  own  make  it  so  make  people

allow  them  to  have  their  home  and  keep

it  you  know

um  because  at  the  end  of  the  day  then

youre  just  renting  you  know  because

until  you  die  you  know  but  um  that  was

another  big  thing  and  also  with  the

below  market  rate  housing  you  know  like

um  there  has  to  be  the  lending  process

The  Lending  process  has  to  be

um  gone  through  and  and  changed  because

it  was  extremely  hard  to  get  a  new  any

loan  and  like  I  had  the  same  exact

problem  I  couldnt  get  lenders  to  give

me  a  loan  because  people  didnt  give  me

um alone  with  my  husbands  itin  number

when  I  went  into  market  rate  housing

that  I  had  no  problem  with  that  I  had  no

problem  with  that  it  was  the  specific

Banks  they  choose  say  no  not  the

specific  Banks  but  the  program

the  program  its  written  in  the  program

so  or  I  dont  I  dont  know  the  exact

language  so  I  think  that  language  has  to

be  addressed  because  if  you  say  that

people  without  socials  or  people  with  it

numbers  like  cannot  be  a  part  of  this

process  that  you  take  out  a  humongous

portion  of  families  and  people  who  are

now  unable  to  have  access  to  affordable

housing

and  so  thats  a  huge  thing  for  me

you  know  and  just  making  that  process  a

little  bit  easier  too  you  know  a  lot  of

people

um

uh  like  um  you  have  to  go  in  person  and

Im  not  saying  this  process  has  to  be

extremely  easy  but  like  these  are

families  these  are  moms  working  two  jobs

these  are  dads  working  three  and  four

jobs  you  know  that  have  to  pay  for  child

care  that  have  to  go  to  all  these

different  things  so

you  know

um

yeah  I  just  I  just  think  that  that  whole

process  has  to  be  changed  it  has  to  be

there  has  to  be  more  resources  for

people  who  have  a  harder  time  with

English  and  and  everything  thats  what

thats  what  I  feel  you  know

as  a  as  an  electrician  as  a  local  San

Francisco  electrician  who  builds

affordable  housing  right  who  builds  the

last  affordable  housing  project  I  did

was  1950  Mission  Street  I  you  know  San

Francisco  power  did  the  main  power

distribution  in  that  facility

um

is  it  its  a  Bittersweet  uh  feeling  for

me  because  when  theres  projects  when

theres  cranes  in  the  skies  that  means

that  I  have  work  and  that  that  that  I

wont  sit  at  home  right  but  its  its

bitter  for  me  because  I  know  that  all

these  buildings  are  going  to  go  up  and

theres  only  going  to  be  uh  x  amount  of

housing  for  low  income  and  whats  whos

really  going  to  move  in  right  what  is

what  what  how  is  it  really  going  to

change  the  city  what  what  is  our  city

gonna  you  know  look  like  after  this

project  you  know  thats  why  me  and  me

and  my  best  friend  whos  also  San

Francisco  negative  we  love  to  be  on  like

hospitals  and  schools  and  and  and

projects  like  that  because  when  were

building  homes  its  kind  of  like  we

dont  really  know  because

you  know  being  a  San  Francisco  native

um

and  and watching  the  city  change  its

been  rough  it  has  been  rough  I  mean  you

know

um  we  we  see  people  getting  evicted  our

families  are  getting  evicted  my  you  know

my  my  grandparents  were  evicted  and

shortly  passed  away  after  once  they  had

to  move  all  the  way  to  Dixon  you  know  my

my  best  friends  mom  who  lived  on  19th

and  Grill  she  was  evicted  you  know  and

um

and  um  so  many  these  stories  are  just

its  just  the  displacement  it  does

something  it  does  something  to  community

because  its  like  it  really  hurts  it

hurts  people  you  know

um

and  uh

I  think  that  what  I  realized  because

um  when  you  grow  up  in  San  Francisco  and

you  see  the  city  change  so  much  and  you

have  that  you  have  that  sense  of  Pride

right  like  when  you  meet  somebody  from

San  Francisco  youre  like  oh  where  where

are  you  from  whered  you  go  to  high

school  right  like  um  and  you  and  you  see

it  change

when  I  was  younger

I used  to  get  upset  right  I  used  to  get

upset  like  man

um  with  the  gentrification  it  comes  all

the  different  the  different

types  of  racism  right  oh  now  all  of  a

sudden  you  cant  play  your  music  loud  in

the  park  or  theres  different  people  in

the  park  and  it  makes  you  feel  unsafe

you  know  or  people  look  at  you

differently  or  people  look  at  your  kids

differently  because  youre  a  different

skin  tone  you  know

um

thats  how  I  felt  like  things  kind  of

changed  I  I  really  felt  the

gentrification  in  terms  of  like  like

with  the  racism  I  I  felt  that  I  felt

that  especially  in  the  mission  you  know



um

but  I  also  understand  that  San  Francisco

is  you  know  its  a  its  constantly

changing  and  thats  the  beauty  of  San

Francisco  its  always  going  to  be

changing  theres  always  going  to  be

people  moving  in  and  out  bringing  their

different

um  beliefs  their  philosophies  and  thats

the  beauty  of  San  Francisco  people  come

here  because  they  cant  be  who  they  are

where  they  come  from  so  they  come  here

because  they  know  its  safe

you  know  and

um I  think  that  one  thing  that  happened

with  the  housing  with  I  feel  like  its

the  tech  industry  the  tech  industry

industry  came  jacked  up  all  the  prices

we  have  a  different  type  of  people

coming  in  the  city  now  and  its  its  not

really  safe  because  these  are  the  people

that  are  calling  the  police

for  every  little  thing  right  and

and  that  you  know

um  goes  into  a  different  whole  you  know

problem  right  like  I  live  in  Hunters

Point

and  they  said  that  this  this  part  of  the

city  is  the  hardest  roughest  part  of  the

city  this  part  of  the  city  youll  hear

gunshots  in  the  night  time  you  know  but

I  can  tell  you  right  now  that  I  know  my

my  next  door  neighbor  I  talk  to  him

every  day  my  next  door  neighbor  on  the

left  of  me  I  talk  to  him  every  day

everybody  knows  the  next  sober  across

the  street  has  mental  illness  the  other

next  door  neighbor  right  here  we  know

his  family  everybody  talks  to  each  other

I  dont  know  why  is  that

why  is  that  they

um

you  know  uh  theres  kids  running  in  the

street  people  are  helping  up  each  other

people  are  making  sure  they  can  get  in

and  out  of  the  parking  lot  I  I  dont  I

dont  know  why  that  is

they  say  its  the  roughest  neighborhood

in  the  street  the  neighborhood  in  San

Francisco  but

its  been  the  most  welcoming  to  me

and  its  the  last  gentrified  I  feel  like

in  San  Francisco  so

I  feel  like  I  derailed  a  little  bit  but

um  yeah  this  is  the  city  changed  so  much

um

the  biggest  thing  the  biggest  thing  that

I  uh  have  a  hard  time  with  is  I  know

that  a  lot  of  people  that  I  grew  up  with

they  dont  have  the  luxury  of  staying

home  with  their  parents  and  they  have  to

go  and  buy  a  house  in  Oakley  and  Hayward

or  and  all  these  they  they  get  they  have

to  they  be  pushed  out  they  will  get

pushed  out  and

um its  really  um  its  really  a

disheartening  feeling  when  you  grow  up

in  a  place  and  you  you  cant  you  want  to

raise  your  kids  in  this  place  you  want

to  raise  your  family  here  but  you  have

to  be  pushed  out  that  feeling  is  you

know  its  a  hard  feeling  its  a  hard

pill  to  swallow

you  know

um

the  pandemic  has  changed  a  lot  of  things

in  Tech  and  its  really  um  its  gonna

Im  really  interested  to  see  how  moving

forward  in  2023  what  our  housing  looks

like  I  mean  I  work  downtown  Im  an

electrician  and

um  the  office  buildings  are  empty

everything  is  empty  a  lot  of  a  lot  of

these  buildings  right  now  theyre  empty

I  dont  know  I  mean  maybe  we  can  convert

some  of  those

those  its  a  housing  to  you  know  to

units  Im  just  saying  that  theres  a  lot

of  theres  a  theres  a  lot  of  real

estate  in  San  Francisco  and  now  with  the

the  changes  and  the  different  Dynamics

with  that  the  pandemic  brought  to  San

Francisco  you  know  we  learn  it  and  we

adapt  I  mean  this  might  just  be  a  way

for  us  to  get  some  more  affordable

housing  in  the  city  you  know  um  because

these  are  buildings  that  are  already  up

and  vacant  so  I  dont  know  what  that

would  entail  with  our  economy  or

whatever  but  just  a  thought

yes  that  is

a  question  you  know  that  right  there  is

so  we  are  like  Union  electricians  and

like  a  lot  like  a  lot  of  other  trades

and  industries  its  a  very  family

oriented  trade  right  like  my  parents

were  electricians  a  lot  of  guys  are

third  generation  electricians  and  a  lot

of  a  lot  of  electricians  have  crazy

routes  to  building  this  city  the

majority  of  electricians  move  out

and  they  they  move  up  north  to  Petaluma

they  move  uh  to  places  like  Brentwood

because  they  cant  afford

um  on  their  single  on  their  single  um

income  as  an  electrician  they  cant

afford  to  buy  a  home  you  know

um  I  I you  know  me  and  my  husband  both

work  so  you  know  were  able  to  to

scrounge  up  enough  money  right  to  make

it  but  a  lot  of  people  we  feel

its  unfair  right  and  its  very

disheartening  right  and  you  get  that

that  that  whole  vibe  of  like  uh  you  know

um

let  me  just  think  about  it  real  quick

its  really  yeah  like  I  without  for  a

lack  of  better  words  its  its  really  BS

it  is  because  you  know  were  putting

were  coming  every  day  to  to  build  San

Francisco  but  we  cant  even  get  a  piece

of  the  rock  you  know  the  majority  of

people  cant  even  get  a  piece  of  the

rock  you  know  and  um

it  uh

it just  pushes  everybody  out  you  know

and

its  a

Its  just  sad  you  know  its  really  sad

we  combat  that  when  our  contract  comes

up  we  cant  combat  that  like  hey  look  we

want  to  race  you  know  every  time  our

contract  comes  up  we  we  go  to  bargain

with  our  Collective  bargain  agreement  we

say  hey  look  cost  of  living  is  going  up

if  we  our  wages  should  reflect  how  you

know  one  should  live  in  San  Francisco

and  how  much  we  should  make  we  should

reflect  that  you  know  so  we  are  getting

raises  and  we  do  we  make  we  make  great

money  and  we  are  one  of  the  most  highest

paying  trades  trades  worker  Craftsmen

out  there  yet  we  can  we  cant  afford  it

we  cant  afford  it  you  know  so  um

thats  thats  how  it  is  in  our  industry

you  know  its  like  everybody  knows  where

are  you  going  to  buy  how  oh  you

Brentwood

everybodys  moving  to  Brentwood  right

now  you  know

um  theres  some  theres  some

electricians  that  like  I  say  have  these

privileges  to  to  stack  and  stay  safe

with  their  parents  and  theyre  coming

from  you  know  families  who  have  who

already  have  it  you  know

but  the  majority  of  Tradesmen  not  just

electricians  plumbers  pipefitters

everybody  they  uh  their  their  commuting

everybodys  Community  you  know

I  I  think  the  only  reason  why  I  I  feel

like

a  little  bit  strange  about

like  erecting

um  a  multi-family  dwelling  unit  or  like

units

um

in  a  residential  neighborhood  were  a

single  family  dwelling  unit  is  because  I

can  just  imagine  I  could  just  imagine

like  you  know  single-family  homes  and

then  all  of  a  sudden  one  day  they  block

off  the  area  and  all  of  a  sudden  a

Cranes  there  and  a  six  six  story  you

know  housing  complex  is  like  right  next

to  this  one  home  right  that  is  just  you

know  maybe  a  grandmother  lives  there  and

then  all  of  a  sudden  its  its  just  this

big  edifice  just  kind  of  like  sticking

out  like  a  sore  thumb  you  know  and  uh

like  literally  literally  changing  what

it  looks  like  right  literally  changing

what  its  like  is  that  a  residential

neighborhood  anymore  its  a  big  building

you  know  like

um  are  the  kids  gonna  come  out  on  the

street  and  play

um  you  know  uh  I  think  that  theres  so

much  space  that  can  be  utilized  in  San

Francisco  to  make

multi-dwelling  units  but  I  I  dont  know

if  allowing

um  allowing

buildings  like  over  six  I  think  theres

a  theres  a  I  think  theres  a

uh  I  think  theres  like  a  code  of  like

if  youre  in  a  residential  area  you

cant  go  over  six  feet  uh  six  floors

um but  even  like  six  floors  and  like  the

sunset  say  like  youre  looking  at  the

sunset  right  and  then  all  of  a  sudden

you  know  they  they  wipe  out  like  four  or

five  homes  and  they  build  like  six

stories

um

I  dont  know  I  dont  know  how  I  feel

like  I  feel  like  it  might  be  it  it  might

take  away  a  little  bit  from  San

Francisco  the  single  family  dwellings  is

just  its  one  of  those

its  like  its  like  an  Antiquity  thing

you  know  like  and  thats  why  the  housing

market  is  so  hot  thats  because  they

dont  build  single  family  dwellings

anymore  you  know

um  but  yeah  I  I  I  would  have  to  do  more

research  before  I  say  Im  totally

opposed  of  it  but  I  do  I  do  feel  that

theres  theres  different  parts  of  San

Francisco  that  that  can  be  utilized  for

for  housing  in  areas  that  already  look

like  that  in  terms  of  like  the  Soma  the

Bay  View  too  even  the  Bay  View  they

started  you  know  erecting  larger

buildings

um but  in  those  areas  I  guess  because  it

seems  so  foreign  to  me  because  theyre

putting  these  these  uh  buildings  in  all

these  other  places  and  I  get  used  to

that  I  guess  maybe  Im  just  not  used  to

it  but  I  I  could  go  both  ways  I  could  go

both  ways  I  just  dont  want  a  little

Grandma  to  like  walk  outside  and  like

all  of  a  sudden  see  all  this  this

humongous  you  know  big  building  you  know

but

hey  if  its  gonna



give  more  affordable  homes  to  people  in

San  Francisco  like  San  Francisco  natives

maybe  its  something  to  look  into  you

know

oh  I  think  the  most  vulnerable  I  think

the  most  vulnerable  right  now  is  the

black  and  brown  Community

um

like  um

honestly  I  feel  like

um

I  feel  like

Im  going  to  talk  about  as  like  human

beings  you  know  like  in  my  experience  in

San  Francisco  and  seeing  seeing  my  uh

seeing  fellow  human  beings  suffer  and

Ive  seen  a  lot  of  the  Ive  seen  a  lot

of  the  immigrant  immigrant  Community

people  who  moved  into  San  Francisco

whos  been  living  in  San  Francisco  for

years  now  but  theyre  immigrants  you

know  suffer  the  most  because  they  didnt

get  any  money  with  the  pandemic  they

theyre  under  the  radar  theyre

undocumented  because  so  they  dont  they

dont  get  any  stimulus  money  they  dont

get  any  rent  relief  money  I  mean  they

dont  get  any  help  its  on  them  all

their  jobs  are  have  been  taken  away

because  a  lot  of  these  workers

um  clean  houses  and  all  all  that  stuff

is  going  to  care.com  you  cant  get  on

care  I  got  home  without  a  social  like

the  um you  know  the  Immigrant  community

in  San  Francisco

um  you  know  they  they  I  feel  like  uh  it

is  a  is  a  community  that  that  that

suffers  the  most  also  you  know  the  black

community  as  well  I  feel  like  the  black

community  as  well  is

um  with  the  thats  just  pushing  out  you

know  like  we  just  redid  Sunnydale  they

knocked  down  the  Sunnydale  projects  and

they  gave  everybody  vouchers

but  then  then  then  certain  people

couldnt  come  back  if  they  had

a  record  of  some  sort  there  was  there

was  some  language  in  there  that  only

certain  people  got  vouchers  to  come  back

and  it  was  just  a  way  to  get  the  black

community  and  push  him  out  and

um  I  think  thats  going  to  continue

going  on  theyre  going  to  continue  to

say  oh  were  going  to  redo  these  housing

complexes  were  going  to  redo  the

Potrero  theyre  doing  the  patreon  right

now  they  knocked  down  the  portrayal

housing  projects  and  theyre  giving

everybody  vouchers  but  theyre  pushing  a

lot  of  people  back  and  a  lot  of  people

are  not  going  to  come  back  they  are  not

coming  back  and  that  though  Im  not

trying  to  say  like  those  people  but

those  are  the  communities  those  are  the

communities  that  make  San  Francisco

the  the  communities  that  that  have  been

here  for  so  long  you  know  like  sorry  I

just  get  um I  get  emotional  when  I  talk

about  it  because  you  know  like

like  I  had  friends  who  lived  in  the

projects  lets  be  real  I  I  had  friends

who  lived  in  Hunters  Point  I  remember

going  to  sleepovers  at  Hunters  Point  I

remember  to  go  pick  up  my  friend  in  um

patrol

um  and  and  I  I  didnt  have  any  friends

in  Sunnydale  but  you  know  to  just  see

them  come  with  a  wrecking  ball  and  you

smash  all  these  housing  complexes  and

then  rebuild  new  new

um buildings  but  only  allow  certain

people  to  come  back  you  know  um

Im  not  down  with  that

I  I think  those  are  the  communities  its

almost  like  its  almost  like  people  who

are  living  in  the  housing  projects  are

being  targeted  right  now  like  they  know

theyre  coming  they  know  in  their  bones

that  you  know  theyre  gonna  theyre

gonna  theyre  gonna  you  know  knock  these

down

and  so

um  you  know  weve  seen  it  with  Fillmore

weve  seen  it  with

um

Sunnydale  portrayal  like  I  said  all

these  all  these  places  in  San  Francisco

that  bring  so  much  culture  so  much

culture  of  the  city  just  pushed  out

so  I  hope  those  those  that  Community

immigrate  The  Immigrant  Community

um

yeah  I  feel  like  those  are  the  two

that  are  really  having  a  hard  time  right

now  just  trying  to  make  it  you  know

um  in  San  Francisco  yeah  like  um

you  know  the  sunset  and  the  you  know

um  St  Francis  area  the  Richmond  area

theres  grocery  stores  theres  Parks

theres  theres  bus  lines  that  go  there

you  know  theres  schools  you  know  and

and  so  I  just  moved  to  you  know  Hunters

Point  that  area  man  theres  not  even  uh

theres  theres  a  Foods  call

theres  a  food  skull  you  know  and

um

I  hate  to  tell  you  that  they  dont  have

the  most  healthy  food  you  have  to  you

have  to  drive  at  least  30  45  minutes  to

get  to  a  you  know  a  rainbow  or  a  Whole

Foods  you  know

um  I  would  like  to  see  more

um  grocery  stores  that  are  healthy  like

good  life  rainbow  with  these  co-ops  that

uh  in  in

um  like  the  Hunters  Point

um

that  Hunters  Point  area  the  Sunnydale

area

you  know  over  there  where  the  Geneva

Towers  were  theres  theres  no  theres

barely  they  just  put  a  t  over  there  so

even  even  uh  it  would  be  nice  to  get  a

bus  more  buses  to  go  in  those  areas  too

um  but  more  buses  healthy  grocery  stores

stores  that  we  can  actually  feed  our

kids  and  I  I  know  foods  are  expensive

right  now  but  you  know

um  but  it  would  be  nice  to  see  more

grocery  stores  out  there  and  more

schools  more  schools  and  more  resources

like  after  school  programs  and

um  soccer  leagues  and  baseball  leagues

and  we  have  one  YMCA  thats  it  we  have

one  facility  that  offers  you  know

um  like  um

extracurricular  activities  to  our  youth

in  Hunters  Point  you  know  so  it  would

be  nice  to  see  more  resources  like  that

to  bring  communities  together  you  know

um

in  those  neighborhoods  more  like  I  would

say  like  Im  looking  at  the  map  like

South  the  Southwest  the  southwest  of  San

Francisco

you  know  its  just  theres  nothing  out

there  you  know  but  I  guess  its  still

being  developed  you  know

I  love  the  fact  that  that  the  Hunters

Point  is  there  theres  a  lot  of  its  a

black  and  brown  community

I  love  the  fact  that  its  a  black  and

brown  community  and  my  daughter  can  I

could  take  my  daughter  to  the  park  out

there  and

she  can  see  other  people  of  color  you

know

um

and  uh  it  would  be  really  nice

to  to

um  you  know

not  push  out  all  the  black  and  brown

people

you  know

um  it  would  be  really  nice  to  keep  that

that  aspect  you  know  Hunters  Point  has

always  been  you  know  its  its  a  black

and  brown  Community  you  know  and  um

I  uh

I  like  the  fact  that  everybody  is  very

social  in  my  neighborhood

um

theres  so  many  things  I  love  about  that

neighborhood  you  know

um  the  weather  and  stuff

I  would  like  to  see  more

um

extracurricular  activities  for  children

um  theres  Parks  but  theres  theres  no

clubhouses  theres  no  after  school

programs  theres  no  little  league

theres  no  t-ball  theres  theres  the

parks  are  dead  because  like  wrecking

Park  they  dont  they  dont  have  any

facility  like  theres  a  park  but  theres

you  know  you  go  into  like  the  Richmond

area  and

um  uh

close  by  there  is  Portola  and  they  have

baseball  Little  League  they  have  all

these  different  things  but  if  you  get

into  you  know  Hunters  Point  like  MLK

that  Park  is  always  dead  because  theres

nothing  popping  off  you  know  it  would  be

nice  to  have  some  extracurricular

extracurricular  activities  for  children

and  also  for  adults  and  seniors  seniors

like  to  get  out  too  you  know  people

always  forget  about  the  seniors  say  they

love  the  parks  I  used  to  work  for

Wrecking  Park  before  I  got  into  the

trade  you  know  I  was  for  SF  um  Wrecking

Park  I  worked  at  Mission  Rec  all  these

different  parks  and  Senior  seniors  love

to  get  out  just  give  them  a  ping  pong

table  you  know  but  if  we  dont  provide

these  resources  then  no  ones  going  to

come  and  then  the  community  is  just

going  to  be  divided  you  know  a  little

bit  so  it  would  be  nice  to  get  some  more

activities  happening  in  the  in  the  Parks

um

and  like  I  said  some  healthy  choices  for

food

and

it  would  yeah  I  think  thats  extremely

important  Im  really  actually  surprised

that  there  hasnt  been

you  know  hasnt  been  anything  else  going

out  there  you  know  I  think  there  might

have  been  a  Whole  Foods  out  there  one  of

these  I  I  Im  not  sure  but

um  it  would  be  nice  to  get  some  healthy

food  out  there

you  know

in  the  mission  I  have  been  dancing  in

carnival  since  I  was  six  years  old  and

that  is  a  big  celebration  that  is

theres  ever  since  the  birth  of  Carnaval

when  it  was  in  precedah  park  theres

always  been  an  Ortiz  in  the  parade  so  I

can  say  that

um  that  that celebration  and  and  that

coincides  with  you  know  the  jazz

festival  all  these  festivals  the  Cherry

Blossom  Festival  you  know  all  these

festivals  first  that  make  San  Francisco

unique  because  it  brings  all  its  such  a

Melting  Pot

um  we  have  to  preserve  those

celebrations  you  know

um  the  uh  even  the  history  of  just

celebrating  us  Community  you  know  its

so  important  to  come  together  and

celebrate  as  community  and  with  the

pandemic  we  really  seen  how

um

its  uh

how  delicate

how  delicate  uh  that  bond  is  you  know  so

the  the  the  parades  and  the  festivals

they  gotta  be  they  got  I  dont  even

think  I  dont  think  the  community  would

let  you  you  know  take  those  away  you

know  the  the  fact  that  San  Francisco  has

always  been  diverse  you  know  I  look

around  San  Francisco  nowadays  its  not

really  that  its  not  really  that  diverse

anymore  only  in  certain  parts  of  the

city  you  know

um  uh  it  would  be  nice  to  preserve  some

of  that  diversity  you  know

um  I  dont  know  how  you  do  that  Im  not

you  know  Im  just  electrician  but  it

would  be  nice  to  send  my  my  kids  to  a

school  and  see  you  know  have  a  wide

range  of  different  cultures  you  know

thats  how  I  grew  up  I  grew  up  I  had

black  friends  I  had  white  friends  I  had

Asian  friends  and  we  had  no  idea  we

didnt  have  any  idea  we  didnt  know  what

racism  was  until  we  like  graduated  high

school  and  got  into  the  real  world

because  thats  San  Francisco  for  you  you

know  like  we  talk  about  that  with  my

friends  for  a  long  time  like  we  didnt

even  like  experience  racism  until  like

we  got  like  real  jobs  because  thats  the

beauty  of  San  Francisco  like  as  a  child

you  know  like

um  I  dont  know  I  dont  know  what  its

going  to  be  like  for  my  kids  to  go  to

school  now  you  know  because  its  so

expensive  and  the  the  demographic  is

changing  so  much  in  the  public  school

system  in  San  Francisco  so  it  would  be

nice  to  to  preserve  the  diversity  you

know  I  think  thats  the  that  because

once  you  preserve  the  diversity  the

culture  the  the  the  the  festivities  all

that  stuff  comes  with  it  all  that  stuff

comes  with  it  you  know  the  minute  you

start  pushing  people  out  and  its  only

one  type  of  people  only  two  type  of

people  thats  when  you  start  getting  the

problems  you  know  thats  when  people

start  just  thats  when  you  lose  you  lose

the  essence  of  San  Francisco  you  know

and  thats  what  I  kind  of  feel  like  its

changed  but  you  know  this  new  generation

and  its  not  too  late  its  not  too  late

to  like  I  said  San  Franciscos  always

going  to  be  changing  its  like  a  living

wreath  breathing  organism  its  always

going  to  change  things  are  always  gonna

its  always  gonna  look  different  its

con  its  going  to  be  constantly  evolving

and  um  I  think  the  best  thing  we  could

do  is  continue  to  get  all  different

types  of  people  and  all  and  celebrate

all  different  types  of  people  and  keep

it  like  that

you  know  and  that  but  that  thats  hard

you  know

you  know

my  dream  one  of  my  dreams  is  that  my

daughters  will  be  able  to  get  a  piece  of

the  rock  like  my  my  parents  said  one  of

my  dreams  is  that  my  daughters  will  be

able  to  live  in  San  Francisco  and  not

have  to

live  paycheck  to  paycheck  on  making  rent

or  making  ends  meet

um  my  dream  is  my  daughters  will  be

close  to  me

um

now  that  I  bought  the  house  so  many

people  like  oh  you  want  you  want  your

house  to  go  up  and  you  want  you  want  the

market  to  go  up  so  you  can  gain  equity

on  that  Ill  be  real  you  know  it  would

be  nice  right  but  if  it  doesnt  Im  Im

cool  because  then  I  know  that  my  my

community  members  the  people  that  I  went
