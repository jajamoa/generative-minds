hello  my  name  is  Ariana  Wilson  I  am  a

San  Francisco  firefighter  with  the  San

Francisco  Fire  Department  Ive  been

employed  with  them  for  the  past  7  years

prior  to  that  volunteered  with  them  for

about  two  and  a  half  years  I  was  born  on

Trader  Street  and  then  grew  up  most  of

my  life  on  Ocean  Avenue  and  then  spent

the  latter  part  of  my  life  over  in  the

panan  region  Im  also  a  Lincoln  high

school

graduate

yeah  so  I  grew  up  in  the  neighborhoods

that  I  previously  mentioned  but  then

spent  most  of  my  time  in  school  living

with  my  dad  over  in  the  Panhandle  region

um  when  I  got  hired  with  the  fire

department  I  ended  up  actually  staying

with  my  dad  through  the  fire  academy

just  due  to  expenses  around  housing  in

the  city  um  and  luckily  after  I

graduated  we  were  lucky  enough  to  have  a

building  that  my  grandmother  purchased  a

very  long  time  ago  and  so  I  was  able  to

rent  a  unit

in  that  building  for  my

family  so  in  general  San  Francisco  is

not  a  very  affordable  City  most  of  my

friends  either  have  two  or  three

roommates  some  people  live  in  co-ops

which  means  theyre  living  with  about  10

to  12  people  just  to  afford  living  here

in  the  city  um  I  have  quite  a  few

co-workers  have  had  to  actually  leave

the  city  to  afford  rent  just  due  to

access  to  schooling  for  their  children

um  they  have  two  or  three  children  and

its  just  not  affordable  to  pay  for  the

type  of  schooling  that  they  want  in  the

city  in  addition  to  rent  so  if  it  wasnt

for  the  building  that  my  grandma  owned

at  somewhat  of  a  prated  rent  I  would  not

be  able  to  probably  afford  my  own  place

in  the  city  on  the  income  that  I  have

without  there  being  a  bunch  of

negotiable  um

circumstances  so  my  father  was  a  union

plumber  for  the  last  last  30  years  with

the  city  and  county  of  San  Francisco  he

has  since  then  retired  and  based  on  what

he  makes  on  retirement  and  Social

Security  it  would  not  be  attainable  for

him  to  live  here  in  this  city  if  he  were

to  be  looking  for  places  to  rent  hed

probably  be  stuck  with  like  a  500  to

800t  room  in  an  apartment  or  an  in-law

that  probably  didnt  include  you  know

gas  electric  internet  water  and  all  of

those  things  and  most  of  my  friends  that

do  live  in  the  city  are  in  very  very

close  quarters  or  very  small  apartments

paying  rents  upwards  to  about  $3,500  a

month  yeah  so  my  youngest  sister  she  got

home  from  college  a  couple  years  ago  and

is  still  living  at  home  with  our  mom  due

to  the  fact  that  rent  is  so  expensive

and  there  isnt  really  the  luxury  of

getting  to  rent  your  own  apartment

without  the  assistance  of  a  second

income  or  knowing  somebody  whos  able  to

prate  that  amount  for  you  my  brother  um

is  currently  in  grad  school  and  lives

with  his  partner  and  if  it  werent  for

that  they  wouldnt  be  able  to  afford  the

apartments  that  they  have  previously  or

currently  live

in

yeah  so  the  San  Francisco  Fire

Department  used  to  have  a  residency

requirement  which  meant  that  you  had  to

be  a  San  Francisco  resident  to  work  here

and  in  part  that  was  in  place  due  to  the

fact  that  we  are  susceptible  to  natural

disasters  specifically  earthquakes  so

when  the  next  big  earthquake  happens

its  not  a  question  of  whether  it  will

happen  its  more  of  when  itll  happen

youre  going  to  need  all  your  resources

we  saw  what  happened  in  lar  pra  weve

seen  the  damages  and  the  negative

effects  that  it  has  on  our  city

and  what  ends  up  happening  is  now  weve

had  to  open  that  up  to  broaden  the

amount  of  people  we  can  accept  in  and  to

get  our  numbers  higher  because  the  need

has  since  and  the  demand  has  since

increased  um  but  a  lot  of  the

firefighters  cant  afford  to  live  here

so  theyre  having  to  move  to  Sacramento

or  to  the  East  Bay  or  to  the  North  Bay

to  find  more  affordable  housing  in  order

to  actually  live  comfortably  um  but  when

this  happens  we  then  end  up  with  not

having  as  many  people  that  we  need  when

the  time  calls  for  these

resources  so  growing  up  I  went  to  lure

Elementary  School  and  at  lure  Elementary

School  there  was  a  very  diverse  group  of

socioeconomic  makeups  so  most  of  my

friends  had  very  lowered  middle  or

workingclass  families  and  households  and

even  within  that  going  to  friends  houses

it  was  always  kind  of  like  a  two-  bed

one  bath  situation  where  even  if  your

parent  was  just  a  teacher  they  were  able

to  afford  this  and  this  was  SU  aable  and

we  grew  up  in  a  household  that  was  a

two-bedroom  one  bath  for  six  people

which  was  really  crammed  but  we  made  it

work  and  later  my  parents  were  able  to

afford  a  renovation  which  created  more

space  for  us  but  this  was  something  that

was  attainable  now  we  look  at  things  and

trying  to  even  just  refinance  or

reconstruct  or  rebuild  your  house  going

from  a  two-bedroom  one  bath  is  just  not

attainable  especially  with  interest

rates  and  so  you  see  a  lot  of  now  what

we  would  call  lower  class  previously

would  be  called  middle  class  Working

Families  just  arent  able  to  sustain

mortgages  interest  rates  uh  monthly

rents  and  so  what  ends  up  happening  is

they  need  to  leave  the  city  to  more

affordable  areas  which  are  no  longer

places  like  Oakland  Marin  you  have  to

keep  pushing  further  out  of  the  Bay  Area

um  and  that  negatively  impacts  not  only

kind  of  like  your  quality  of  life  but

your  ability  to  access  these  resources

that  are  really  specific  and  unique  to

the  city  of  San

Francisco

so  Id  say  that  you  know  where  we  grew

up  off  of  Ocean  Avenue  thats  a  pretty

quiet  sleepy  neighborhood  and  it  always

has  been  um  but  there  was  kind  of  this

level  of  comfort  knowing  that  there  was

safety  in  walking  from  point  A  to  point

B  and  being  able  to  go  to  the  store  as  a

kid  and  being  able  to  knock  on  your

neighbors  door  and  just  knowing  there

was  that  Community  but  in  the  later  part

of  our  Lives  we  spent  a  lot  of  time  near

the  Panhandle  and  growing  up  there  were

churches  that  were  active  which  no

longer  are  partially  because  of  the  lack

of  funding  or  people  that  previously

lived  there  that  actually  used  to  um  go

to  church  they  no  longer  live  there  so

the  neighborhood  I  grew  up  in  was

predominantly

African-American  and  probably  when  I  was

about  12  or  13  um  there  was  this  Mass

Exodus  and  people  were  told  that  were

staying  in  kind  of  affordable  housing

that  if  they  left  and  came  back

Renovations  would  have  a  place  for  them

and  that  really  wasnt  the  case  so  now

you  see  kind  of  this  Mass  again  Exodus

of  the  old  community

that  was  previously  there  not  able  to

come  back  and  a  shift  in  that  which

brings  a  lot  more  money  and  different

types  of  resources  so  as  a  kid  we  had

our  local  corner  store  and  everybody

knew  us  by  first  name  basis  we  had

grandparents  that  kind  of  looked  out  for

us  and  houses  that  we  could  go  in  and

out  of  and  now  the  neighborhood  that  I

live  in  you  knock  on  a  neighbors  door

and  you  try  and  say  hello  and  its  kind

of  welcom  with  a  what  are  you  doing  um

so  its  just  a  shift  in  times  a  shift  in

financial  accessibility  a  shift  in  what

the  housing  market  has  actually  offered

but  even  currently  trying  to  look  at

properties  for  myself  to  even  think

about  buying  theyre  so  far  out  of  range

that  I  have  to  and  Im  almost  forced  to

start  looking  in  other  communities

outside  of  the  Bay

Area  right  so  below  market  rate  even  at

the  rate  of  which  interest  rates  are  at

the  moment  are  not  attainable  for  most

people  and  even  being  a  city  employee

you  look  at  these

rates  and  sure  there  are  loans  with

really  high  interest  rates  but  they

never  match  what  your  actual  income  is

so  even  if  I  wanted  to  buy  a  property

the  only  thing  that  would  even  be

remotely  attainable  for  me  would

probably  be  like  a  600  foot  home  that

doesnt

exist  while  resource  neighborhood  to  me

would  mean  having  access  to  a  good  and

running  Library  a  place  of  prayer  if

that  is  something  that  is  important  to

somebodys  religious  beliefs  a  safe

Community

Center  good  education  a  good  public

school  with  good  reviews  something  that

doesnt  only  um  pertain  to  private

school  because  we  go  to  certain

neighborhoods  and  we  look  at  Pacific

Heights  for  instance  and  we  have  access

to  really  clean  eating  great  restaurants

good  music  good  places  of  prayer  places

to  you  know  practice  religious

activities  we  have  really  phenomenal

schools  that  are  highly  ated  but  also

extremely  expensive  um  so  you  have

things  like  steuart  Hall  um  Convent  you

have  University  and  all  these  schools

that  are  only  accessible  for  people  that

have  the  funds  to  do  so  and  the  means  to

do  so  and  so  when  we  look  at  other

neighborhoods  that  are  quote  unquote

still  affordable  they  dont  have  all

these  resources  you  maybe  have  one  or

two  corner  stores  you  maybe  have  a  park

that  hasnt  been  upkept  and  maintained

as  well  as  other  I  guess  locations  you

have  maybe  a  gas

station  maybe  an  abandoned  building  or

something  that  hasnt  been  lived  in  for

quite  a  few  years  but  there  is  a  stark

difference  between  the  well  populated

well  financially

supported  communities  versus  ones  that

arent  right  so  if  we  look  at  lets  say

noi  Valley  versus  Bay  View  Hunters  Point

bayew  Hunters  Point  has  all  has  been  an

environment  where  you  do  not  have  access

to  the  resources  that  any  other

community  in  the  city  does  and  this  has

been  something  that  weve  known  for

years  and  were  starting  to  build  more

housing  there  and  as  we  see  that  and  as

we  see  an  influx  of  money  moving  there

we  see  more  resources  being  built  but

something  that  iol  question  is  why  is  it

it  take  why  does  it  take  that  in  order

for  these  resources  to  be  built  but  this

has  been  something  that  ever  since  I  was

a  kid  we  knew  existed  um  and  noi  Valley

has  always  been  very  family  oriented  but

has  always  had  different  places  like

Whole  Foods  and  tons  of  great

restaurants  and  tons  of  access  for

children  to  go  to  clean  safe  parks  and

thats  not  something  that  we  see  all

over  the  city  um  which  has  been

unfortunate  and  continues  to  kind  of  be

the  same

way  yeah  I  know  theres  always  a

kickback  and  a  pushback  for  building

housing  in  specific  neighborhoods  for

instance  the  old  Childrens  Hospital  has

been  vacant  now  for  I  want  to  say  a

number  of  years  and  this  would  be  a

great  place  to  create  housing  and

theres  been  a  lot  of  backlash  from  the

neighborhood  saying  they  dont  want  that

type  of  housing  in  their  neighborhood

but  these  are  also  people  that  are

communicating  theyre  really  fed  up  with

certain  issues  that  were  experiencing

in  the  city  like  homelessness  and

poverty  and  so  there  needs  to  be  a  point

in  which  the  city  comes  together  and

makes  a  decision

collectively  that  we  are  looking  out  for

the  best  interest  of  everybody  that

lives  in  the  city  I  think  that  its

really  important  that  everybody  is  is  a

part  of  providing  a  affordable

sustainable  way  of  living  for  the  folks

that  live  in  San  Francisco  and  I  think

the  same  way  that  we  approach

homelessness  and  creating  resources  and

providing  safe  places  for  people  to  live

you  also  need  to  provide  a  safe  place

for  the  people  that  serve  the

city  because  what  do  we  do  without  them

as  First  Responders  you  guys  heavily

rely  on  us  our  call  volume  reflects  this

the  needs  of  the  city  reflects  this  and

if

you  want  to  see  a  fully  function

City  that  kind  of  offers  the  best

opportunity  for  everybody  you  need  to

provide  a  space  that  is  healthy  safe

affordable  to  live  for  the  people  that

serve

it  yeah  I  think  there  are  a  handful  of

neighbor  neighborhoods  my  whole  life

that  have  not  been  available  or

affordable  for  me  like  Pacific  Heights

is  a  gorgeous  neighborhood  that  has  tons

of  resources  it  has  tons  of  space  its

clean  its  quiet  but  Ill  never  be  able

to  afford  living  there  Id  say  even  noi

Valley  a  neighborhood  that  has  tons  of

great  schooling  it  has  really  safe

places  for  children  to  hang  out  if

youre  looking  to  raise  a  family  Id

love  to  live  in  but  I  wouldnt  be  able

to  afford  it  the  mission  is  slowly

changing  to  a  place  that  I  can  no  longer

afford  to  live  in  but  its  also  shifting

as  a  neighborhood  as  a  whole  um  and  so

really  when  you  look  at  housing  and

whats  affordable  its  the  outskirts  of

the  city  that  have  lack  of  access  to

specific  resources  that  everywhere  else

more  centralized  do  um  with  the

exception  of  Id  say  the  tenderloin

because  that  has  always  been  a  place

that  has  provided  affordable  living  with

SRO  to  low  income  marginalized

communities  I  know  that  we  have  a

program  in  place  for  firsttime  home

buyers  in  the  city  which  really  creates

an  amazing  opportunity  but  that  isnt

enough  based  on  the  budget  that  they

have  for  the  majority  of  people  in  the

city  that  do  not  make  an  income  that

matches  the  the  needs

of

match  it  doesnt  match  the  pricing  of

the  housing  market

and  so  Id  love  to  see  more  loans  like

that  that  were  put  in  place  Id  love  to

see  um  I  guess  more  of  an  attempt

to  manage  and  kind  of

disperse  taxes  that  were  paying  towards

housing  because  we  pay  very  very  steep

expensive  taxes  in  the  city  and  we  dont

really  see  it  reflected  in  how  they

provide  affordability  in  housing  um  Id

love  to  see  there

be  more  agreement  and  cohesiveness  among

people  that  are  kind  of  preventing

development  in  neighborhoods  that  they

are  trying  to  preserve  um  and  more

opened  more  open-mindedness  around

diversifying  a  city  that  really  used  to

be  extremely  diverse  and  inclusive  and

um  Less  divisiveness  in

that  I  really  appreciate  the

accessibility  of  my  neighborhood  Im

right  near  the  Panhandle  at  the  moment

um  and  I  appreciate  the  ability  to  get

outside  and  have  access  to  like  a

beautiful  walk  through  the  park  and

access  to  Golden  Gate  Park  there  are

still  a  few  old  bars  if  youre  into  that

whether  you  drink  or  you  dont  drink

that  provide  really  great  music  and  art

um  it  is  accessible  and  really  really

centralized  to  everything  in  the  city

the  Castro  is  extremely  close  the  richm

is  really  close  you  head  a  little  bit

further  and  you  have  lower  pack  Heights

even  further  than  that  youre  heading

kind  of  towards  Japan  town  and  so  I  love

how  centralized  my  neighborhood  is  but

something  that  its  really  missing  is

kind  of  the  sense  of  community  and  the

iers  diversity  and  having  had  spent  time

there  as  a  child  and  just  seeing  so  many

different  people  of  so  many  different

walks  of  life  whether  it  be  somebody  who

is  of  Hispanic  descent  or

African-American  descent  or  somebody  who

is  Asian-American  or  Pacific  Islander  or

middle  eastern  there  was  representation

and  as  a  kid  you  know  my  mom  would  take

us  to  Golden  Gate  Park  every  Saturday

and  wed  rent  a  bike  or  wed  go

rollerblading  and  that  was  kind  of  what

happened  but  you  found  community  that

way  and  I  think  when  you  start  to  take

away

from  accessibility  and  affordability  you

you  lose  a  lot  of  that  and  now

demographically  my  neighborhoods

predominantly  Caucasian  um  a  little

blended  with  a  little  bit  of

Asian-American  or  you  know  Asian  descent

but  you  dont  see  as  much  of  that

Vibrance  and  that  diversity  and  mix  of

different  backgrounds  and  so  I  think

what  I  would  love  for  this  community  is

to  kind  of  shift  back  towards  that

whether  that  be  making  things  more

affordable  for  individuals  so  that  they

can  come  back  to  a  community  they  once

called  their  own

or  just  branching  out  to

um  I  guess  different  communities  and

resources  and  asking  for  that

support  yeah  I  mean  I  would  say  you  know

the  mission  specifically  used  to  have  a

very  big  community  of  Hispanic  um

Central  South  American  communities  right

you  had  a  lot  of  people  from  Nicaragua

El  Salvador  Mexico  Peru  Bolivia  and

thats  really  been  lost  and  I  think

there  was  this  vibrancy  and  community

that  was  just  really  phenomenal  and

amazing  there  were  a  lot  of  families

based  there  there  was  a  lot  of  music

there  was  a  lot  of  art  there  was  a  lot

of  culture  and  the  Western  Edition  in

Filmore  predominantly  used  to  be

African-American  and  within  that  you  had

the  Jazz  Community  jazz  festivals  you

had  tons  of  vibrant  amazing  lovely  food

and  music  and  we  losing  a  lot  of  that

throughout  the  city  which  is  really

unfortunate  and  Id  love  to  see  some  of

that  community  and  kind  of  like

integrity

and  just  I  guess  like  special  magic

around  that  come  back  and  um  its  really

sad  to  see  that  shift  because  people

cant  afford  to  live  here  and  so  seeing

people  priced  out  and  having  to  leave

and  not  having  the  access  to  resources

that  they  used  to  is  just  disappointing

you  know  Lake  Street  has  always  been  a

street  that  has  had  I  would  say  more

wealthy  people  living  on  it  and  the

houses  are  a  little  more  expensive  but

at  this  point  theyre  just  not

attainable  for  most  folks  and  I  would

say  the  sunset  has  always  was  been  a

place  growing  up  where  a  lot  of  my

friends  that  were  of  Russian  descent  or

Asian-American  or  Chinese  or  Vietnamese

or  Cambodian  used  to  live  in  and  a  lot

of  their  parents  werent  able  to  sustain

that  level  of  living  and  have  now  since

been  priced  out  or  left  or  had  to  leave

because  they  could  no  longer  afford

housing  that  was  affordable  like  most  of

the  people  that  I  know  that  live  in  the

sunset  are  only  able  to  live  there  or

continue  to  live  there  because  their

families  were  lucky  and  bought  at  a  time

where  housing  was  affordable  so  most  of

the  kids  that  I  know  that  grew  up  going

to  Catholic  School  School  their  parents

still  live  there  but  thats  because  they

were  able  to  hold  on  to  a  home  that  has

either  then  been  passed  down  or  bought

out  by  family  which  is  always  more

affordable  than  needing  to  get  a  loan  um

one  of  my  co-workers  was  able  to  buy  a

house  from  their  grandparent  due  to  the

fact  that  it  was

affordable  yeah  Id  say  a  thriving

Community  looks  like  one  that  is  able  to

provide  clean  eating  right  whether  that

be  farmers  markets  and  locally  sourced

food

whether  that  be  having  a  place  like

Whole  Foods  that  offers  organic  non  GMO

options  a  thriving  Community  to  me

entails  having  access  to  music  and

education  and  arts  and  creativity  and

safe  places  of  learning  um  a  thriving

Community  also  means  having  people  that

dont  look  like  you  its  important  to  be

exposed  to  folks  that  come  up  from

different  backgrounds  than  you  do  um

that  means  also  having  accessibility  to

healthcare  and  or  health  clinics  not

just  onetime  visits  hospitals  Museums

Art  culture  um  and  so  I  think  thriving

communities  means  its  all-encompassing

and  all  inclusive  in  every  aspect  and

not  specific  to  a  specific  de  its  not

catering  just  to  a  specific  demographic

or  socioeconomic

need  Id  love  to  have  a  city  where

people  that  grew  up  here  and  contributed

and  continued  to  contribute  to  the  city

had  the  option  to  buy  a  house  or  live  in

a  place  that  they  comfortably  could

consider  home  whether  that  be  an

apartment  and  thats  all  that  youve

ever  aspired  to  have  whether  that  be  a

three-bedroom  house  because  thats  all

youve  ever  wanted  in  your  life  before

but  also  just  having  a  clean  affordable

safe

comfortable  way  of  life
