okay  uh  my  name  is  Angela  Wilson

um  my  occupation  was  City  plumber  Im  a

retired  City  plumber  worked  for  DPW

um

what  else  do  you  want  to  know

where  youre  from  oh  where  Im  from  I

was  born  in  Kentucky  Fort  Knox  Kentucky

and  Im  an  army  brat  so  Im  from  all

over

when  did  you  come  to  San  Francisco  we

came  to  San  Francisco  in  64.

and  we  moved  first  to  Glen  Park  for  like

six  months  and  then  we  got

um  quarters  on  the  Presidio

in  wearing  housing  area

uh  you  know  right  next  to  Baker  Beach

um  then  wearing  housing  area

was  provided  provided  housing  for

military  folks  and  it  didnt  cost  me  it

it  basically  costs  what  your  stipend  was

what  the  military  gave  you  so  they  had  a

lot  of  poor  kids  over  there  not  poor  but

military  kids  basically  poor

and  then  you  were  sent  to  schools  it

depend  on  the  census  of  the  school  and

the  City

if  the  census  was  down  they  get  a

busload  of  kids  and  send  them  over

to  that  school  so  yeah  the  Army  had

contract  contracts  with  the  city  schools

okay  we  lived  in  the  Presidio  my  father

got  stationed  in  Oakland

we  went  over  to  Oakland  for  six  months

and  couldnt  stand  it  because  they  were

trying  to  burn  the  city  down

um

is  in  67  they  were  riding  over  there  and

then  we  got  we  came  back  to  San

Francisco  and  then  I  lived  on  Parsons

Street  Parson  street  right  above  the

hate

67th  I  think  was  66  at  the  end  of  67-68

so  we  had  as  our  neighbors

Country  Joe  and  the  Fish

on  Jefferson  Starship

Jew  or  star

airplane  Jefferson  or  airplane  it  back

then  and  we  had  Jules  brassard

practicing  his  his  saxophone  across  the

street  and  it  was  basically  a  rich

hippie  area

um  and  people  that  went  to  USF  not

really  they  really  kind  of  lived  in  the

dorms  then  they  didnt  have  to  live

outside

so  it  was  all  Saint  Ignatius

it  used  to  be  until  they  they  closed  it

down  I  think  68  and  built  it  over  on

next  to  giannini

um  yeah  so  it  was  affordable

um

um

yeah  that  was  our  living  situation  until

we  moved  on

um  like  eight  blocks  away  down  on  Haight

Street  and  was  it  75  so  in  67

um  we  moved

to

Parson  Street  and  74  75  we  moved  down  to

Hay  Street  Hayes  and  Central

when  my  parents  first  went  looking  for

housing  in  the  city

um  they  went  to  green  and  Kaufman  on

yerry  street  and  they  were  told  that

they  didnt

not  that  green  and  Kaufman  I  dont  I

dont  think  it  was  the  statement  that

green  and  Kaufman  didnt  sell  to  black

people  but  theyre  saying  that  if  you

want  to  buy  in  the  Richmond  they  didnt

sell  to  black  people

you  know  you  arent  going  to  finally

find  the  houses  that  you  want  though

there  were  some  black  families  there  but

um  I  think  most  of  those  families

bought  the  buildings  because  they  knew

the  people  or  somehow

you  know  nobody  wanted  the  building

and  then

um

so  it  was

basically  10  years  later  that  they  ended

up  buying

you  know  at  that  time  if  you  had  the

money  to  buy  in  a  neighborhood  you  were

not  allowed  to  buy  in  the  neighborhood

my  mother  said

um  Presidio  gate  those  houses  were  45

and  50  000  or  something  along  that  line

you  know  among  the  Presidio  wall  or

whatever

maybe  theyre  making  the  story  up  but

you  you  could  have  all  the  money  in  the

world  but  you  werent  going  to  get  it

the  the  easiest  thing  to  do  was  go  in  a

neighborhood  that  still  was  black

and  then  you  could  buy  and  my  parents

um

you  know  theyre  they  were  smart  enough

to  know  that  you  know  theyd  have  the

renters  pay  for  their  building  so  they

bought

they  bought  three  Flats  they  it  was

three  Flats  divided  up  into  five  units

and  thats  where  we  moved  on  Hay  Street

and  then  two  years  later  they  bought

another  house

a  house  over

but  that  that  was  not  unusual  that

working  people  could  buy  things  in  the

city  then  I  have  friends  that  lived  in

public  housing  the  father  became  a

plumber  he  bought  a  home  he  bought  a

vacation  home  and

in  Clear  Lake

he  bought  a  vacation  home  in  Bodega  and

he  had  a  house  in  South  City

so  that  was  not  Beyond

the  imaginings  of  working

class  people  to  have  more  than  one  home

you  know

my  current  housing  situation  Im  living

in  a  building  my  mother

left  to  me

I  actually  left  me  to  live  in  and  left

to  my  kids

and  so  if  you  didnt  have  that  how

difficult  would  it  be  to  live  in  San

Francisco  I  wouldnt  be  living  here  I

wouldnt  be  able  to  afford  it  I  probably

live  in  a  in  a  studio  or  something  you

know

uh  400  square  foot  Studio  or  something

and  Id  probably  be  paying  eighteen

hundred  dollars  or  fifteen  hundred

dollars  or  more  than  that  but  no  its

not

its  not  on  the  horizon  it  wouldnt  be

on  my  Horizon  Id  be  moving  to  the

someplace  else  and  is  that  because

youre  kind  of  like  on  a  fixed  income

and  well  I  am  working  once  I  once  I

retired  Im  in  a  fixed  income  and

um

also  you  know  um

yeah  Im  on  a  fixed  income  and  you  if

you  dont  have  money  youre  on  the

fixing

when  my  sister  moved  to  Georgia  my

mother  moved  back

to  Georgia  because  you  want  to  be  with

the  relatives  basically  my  sister

because  her  husband  retired  from  the

um  post  office  it  wasnt  affordable  for

her  to  live  in  the  city

um

yeah  but  I  remember  when  single  mothers

with  their  children  could  afford  to  keep

a  roof  over  their  head  and  they  would  be

probably  a  receptionist  added  I  in  fact

I  know  somebody  was  a  receptionist

Hunter  Dennis  office  and  had  three  sons

and  she  was  able  to  provide  housing  for

him

I  dont  know  you  know  a  decent  place  to

live  I  know  another  woman  who  had  two

boys  and  a  daughter  and

yeah  she  was  the  only  one  working  and

she  was  able  to  provide  housing  for  her

kids

they  were  able  to  live  in  the  Richmond

which  is

who  can  afford  to  live  there  you  know

you  got  three  and  four  people  living  to

put  the  money  together  to  stay  in  the

flat

yeah  development  thank  you

well

my  daughter

one  of  my  daughters  is  a  fireman  she

cant  afford  to  live  away  from  home  she

lives  in  the  flat  above  me  that  we

inherited

shes  thinking  trying  to  get  into  a

program  where  she  can  maybe  put  down  on

the  house  thats  provided  by  the  city

but  you  know  I

even  if  you  do  get  in  the  program  if

your  choices  are  in  the  million  over  a

million  are  somewhere  around  a  million

um  how  do  you  pay  ten  thousand  dollars  a

year  in  property  tax  and  pay  insurance

and  then  pay  your  utilities  and  yeah  you

can  you  can  be  frugal  and  you  can  really

be  willful

and  want  to  do  it  but

but  it  makes  it  difficult

on  you

um

yeah  it  used  to  be  affordable

and  can  any  of  your  kids  so  she  cant

afford  like  any  of  your  kids  afford  the

city  do  you  think  or  not  to  buy  a  home

you  know  if  thats  the  goal

um  but  even  even  to  its  almost  its

even  more  expensive  to  rent  than  it  is

to  buy  it  seems

so  I  dont  think  there  are  very  many

options

you  know  for  them

to  Dream  On

could  I  tell  you  about  San  Francisco  San

Francisco  used  to  be  a  city  everybody

dreamed  of  it  was  it  was  like  you  know

if  they  you  know  in  myth  it  was  the

Golden  Mountain  or  whatever  but  for

people  who  came  from  the  south  it  was  a

place  there  were  stories  told  about  San

Francisco  that  said  if  you  walk  down  the

street  and  you  saw  a  quarter  you  just

kicked  it  out  of  your  way  because  if  he

kept  walking  you  could  pick  up  a  dog  a

silver  dollar

and  that  was  that  was  that  was  the  Bay

Area  that  was  what  you  were  going  to  do

the  city  was  full  of  Union  it  was  a

union  shop  just  about  every  job  in  the

city  was  a  union  job

everybody  can  make  a  decent  living  and

live  in  the  city  and  when  development

started  in  the  city

it  moved  everybody  out  they  commodified

housing  they  wanted  to  get  the  last

Penny  they  could  out  of  a  out  of  real

estate  and  that  forced  everybody  to  move

and  now  you  have  people  that  are  really

committed  theyre  just

theyre  here  for  the  opportunity  as  long

as  the  opportunities  here  theyre  here

theyre  not  really  bringing  their  family

here  theyre  not  really  building

neighborhoods  they  even  changed  the

neighbor  the  name  of  neighborhoods  to

make  them  attractive

you  know  nopa  what  the  hell  is  nopa  what

is  SOPA  what  you  what  are  those  things

you  know  uh  North  give  me  a  break

you  know  it  used  to  be  working  families

that  were  around  Belvedere

they  were  a  nurse  and  a

they  were  a  nurse  and  a  bus  driver  could

afford  a  house  around  Belvedere

that  used  to  be

or  a  guy  was  a  guard  a  security  guard

and  his  wife  was  a  nurse  they  could

afford  to  live  on  gratin  they  could  have

oh  no  oh  my  gratin

now  those  homes  are  two  and  three

million  dollars  four  and  five  million

dollars  in  some  cases

and  they  cant  afford  it  and  thats  all

due  to  everybody  trying  to  pinch

the  maximum  value  out  of  something

and  um

and  uh  I  I  I  dont  see  the  solution  in

being  you  know  you  make  call  call  it

affordable  housing  how  can  housing  be

affordable  if  it  costs  five  to  seven

hundred  thousand  dollars  a  unit  to  build

nobody  nobodys  gonna

rent  cheaply  something  they  they  put

three  quarters  of  a  million  dollars  in

to  anybody  so  theyre  looking  for  their

return  which  means  that  still  youre

gonna  have

middle  class  not  even  middle  class  you

can  upper  middle  class  people  coming  in

are  fools  dont  mind  throwing  away  their

money  coming  into  the  city  to  live

well  like  I  said  it  was  a  stipend  we

lived  on

on  in  the  Presidio

you  know  it  was  the  military  State  you

get  housing  okay  and  I  think  you  have  to

make  a  commitment  to  the  people  that

work  here  that  run  the  city  I  mean  not

necessarily  run  the  city  but  they  do

labor  here  that  you  provide  housing  form

and  you  have  to  make  policies  that

attract

better  cater  to  working  people  not  to

investors

I  think  I  I  think  because  you  know

everybodys  just

dizzy  over  the  amount  that  you  have  to

pay  for  a  house  and  their  wonderful

Investments  and  all  this  stuff  and

thats  thats  thats  just  what  they  are

investments  theyre  not  homes

city  has  to  make  a  policy  providing

homes  for  people  not  just

secured  Investments  for  people  that  that

have  more  money  than  they  know  what  to

do  with

um  the  bus  may  or  may  not  stay  there

its  the  21  Hayes  and  it  was  a

convenient  route  for  a  lot  of  people  and

they  closed  it  down  for  two  years  and

then  people  stopped  taking  it  and  it

hasnt  gained  back  its  ridership

and  downtown  theres  nothing  in  downtown

that  people  want  to  go  to  see

you  know  theyve  given  it  away  to

developers  and  theyve  priced  themselves

out  of  an  existence

you  know

yeah  I  mean  yeah  in  a  livable

neighborhood  you  got  good  Transportation

you  have  decent  schools  that  arent

lotteryed  out

we  have  you  know  everybody

who  goes  into  the  lottery  here  in  San

Francisco  now  they  seem  to  think  theyre

all  crows  and  each  of  their  little  crows

is  blacker  than  the  other  one  they

always  think  their  micro  is  prettier  so

theyre  invested  in  their  kid  not  in  the

system  necessarily

so  you  got  you  got  to  have  people  that

are  invested  in  the  school  system  youve

got  to  have  people  that  want  to  send

their  kids  to  schools  you  got  to  have  an

education  system  thats  going  to  provide

them  a  good  education

you  gotta  you  gotta  open  back  up  the

museums  and  and  the  enrichments  that

kids  can  get  so  people  want  to  keep  them

in  public

um  in  the  in  the  public  education  system

um  museums  are  free  everything  was  free

I  used  to  go  in  the  summer  I  used  to  go

to  the  museum  I  actually  became  friends

with  some  of  the  paintings  in  the  museum

I  was  in  love  with  some  of  the  paintings

there  was  this  El  Greco  painting  Christ

was  hanging  on  like  I  you  know  I  just

fell  in  love  with  it

it  was  my  friend

I  would  I  could  take  I  think  you  could

put  up  ten  dollars  or  five  dollars  and

go  take  classes  at  the  Academy  of

Sciences

you  had  that  you  could  walk  in  in

Japanese  tea  garden  you  know  it  we  it

was  a  wonderful  place

and  now  everything  is

commodified

you  know

I  know  things  cost  money  to

cost  money  to  run

but  12  billion  dollars  for  a  city  thats

only  47  square  miles  somethings  wrong

somethings  wrong  theres  a  lot  of  money

slipping  tree  between  the  cracks

its  going  places  that

you  know  it  cant  be  going  to  workers

because  they  cant  afford  to  live  in

this  city  so  it  has  to  be  going

someplace

no  I  remember  Pacific  Heights  used  to  be

paved  the  streets  in  Pacifica  were  paved

three  times  to  the  one

they  pave  it  three  times  make  sure  that

whoever  lived  in  Pacific  Id  say  never

bought  never  had  to  Rattle  themselves

and  then  we  had  a  bus  line  on  our

on  our  street  I  mean  it  seemed  let  me

let  me  take  that  back  it  seemed  like

they  were  paved  three  times  to  our  one

because  the  bus  was  constantly  on  our

road  and  tearing  it  up  you  know  it  was

just  uneven  and  you  can  feel  the  bus  go

by  and  bump  your  house  so  I  think  I

think  the  commercial  areas  need  to  be

taken  care  of  where  you  know  and  I  think

if  you  youve  got

50  million  dollar  mansion  you  can  afford

to  pay  for  your  own  Street  if  you  want

it  done

you  know  they  need  they  need  to  put  they

need  to  put  schools  in  Rich  districts

so  the  kid  has  an  idea  of  what  wealth  is

and  what  they  are  what  the  world  is  not

to  make  them  feel  bad  or  want  to

accomplish  that  but  to  know  that  theres

another  well  when  I  went  to  school  at

Roosevelt  I  had  friends  in  Pacific

Heights

Presidio  Heights

um

yeah  I  got  to  see  what  the  other  half

lived  like  and  they  got  to  see  how  I

lived  and  I  think  it  made  for  a  better

education

I  I  think

you  tax  speculators

I  I  think

I  think  people  that  dont  have  any  that

are  just  consider  housing  as  Investments

I  know  everybody  has  a  right  to  spend

their  money  where  they  want  to  spend

their  money  but  if  you  provide  housing

for  somebody

at  a  decent  rate  you  should  get  special

tax  breaks  people  that  dont  they  should

get  there  behind  back  to  the  wall

you  know  some  guy  whos  gonna  you  know

uh  hes  gonna  buy  up  something  in  the

mission  tear  it  down  put  up  apartment

buildings  charge  45  500  a  month

and  if  youre  looking  to  provide  housing

youre  not  doing  it  thats  not  housing

thats  an  investment  youre  youre  to

help  an  investor  get  along

you  know

um

but  you  know  and  also  people  that  buy

houses  and  put  in  Grandma  units  I  dont

think  thats  a  solution  either  because

certain  neighborhoods  have  characters

you  know  I  think  in  the  sunset  you  have

characters  never  used  to  be  any  you  you

look  at  the  Presidio  what  happened  all

of  a  sudden  theyve  rented  it  out  there

were  never  any  cars  military  people

couldnt  afford  cars

that  now  theres  four  you  know  houses

have  three  cars

they  send  their  kids  to  private  schools

you  know  they  bicycle  home  and  park

three  cars  on  the  street

thats  an  abomination

and  the  people  that  can  best  afford  to

live  on  the  economy

that  can  live  out  in  the  city  are  the

ones  getting  the  housing  in  Presidio

they  tore  down  a  third  of  weary  housing

area  I  think  it  was  or  20  or  something

like  that  because  they  didnt  want  to

see  poor  people

at  the  gates  of  um  Seacliff

its  specific  ice  it  used  to  be  pacific

ice  lower  and  upper  lower  Pacific  ice

was  all  black  it  was  a  black  area

until  developers  came  in  and  scores

people  out  and  drove  the  prices

everything  up  you  know  development  in

the  city

planners

eliminated

lower  Pacific  Heights

they  dug  up  the  Fillmore  district  and

left  it  empty  for  eight  and  ten  years

they  promised  the  people  a  way  back  to

the  city  theyre  going  to  build  these

wonderful  places  to  live  in  and  they

come  back  to  the  city  they  built

wonderful  places  they  started

construction  eight  years  later  and  by

then  they  had  scattered  everybody  from

the  neighborhood

out

and  when  and  that  generation  was  gone  so

they  never  came  back

now  theyre  building  housing  for

I  dont  know  who  theyre  building

housing  for

Im  Im just  trying  to  figure  out  how

you  can  have  a  housing  plan  like  I  said

that  cost  500

700  000  a  unit  and  provide  it  for

anybody  I  dont  give  a  damn  what  part  of

the  city  you  put  it  in

you  know  you  have  to  make  a  commitment

you  got  to  say  either  cheaper  housing

unit  housing  you  know  uh

building  block  housing  something  and

provided  for  people  and  also  you  have  to

get  away  the  concept  get  away  with  the

concept  uh

uh  were  going  to  provide  housing  for

every  single  person  thats  something  Im

talking  single

it  used  to  be  a  city  of  families  you  got

to  make  a  commitment  to  draw  back

families  your  population  would  be  the

same  but  I  think  its  more  affordable

when  you  have  a  family  in  a  unit

I  mean  or  I  mean  if  you  make  a

commitment  to  families  because  everybody

I  knew  lived  in  an  apartment  way  back

when  nobody  lived  in  a  house

nobody  had  more  than  one  car  if  they  had

that  they  used  buses

were  getting

were  building  a  city  thats  catering

to

prosperity

not  to  workers

you  know  I  mean  you  you  want  your

workers  to  be  prosperous  yeah  but  that

should  be  your  focus  the  majority  of

Voters

people  that  work  people  that  are

invested  in  the  city

and  that  arent  going  to  move  on

you  know

my  son

is  fifth  generation  San  Francisco

his  grandparents  came  over  here  and

1848

um

on  his  mothers  side

um

and

Im  here  trying  to  make  a  stand  for  him

you  know  and  I  want  to  see  a  city

full  of  people  a  variety  of  people

a  variety  of

um

you  know  you  want  to  call  it  ethnicities

and  and

what  do  you call  it  finances  or

financially  different

I  want  to  pour  next  to  rich  rich

you  know

skys  the  limit  it  cant  be  the  policy

it  not  if  the  city  is  going  to  survive

I  I  think

my  father  was  janitor  he  were  he  he  was

a  sergeant

he  was  he  was  on  the  Presidio  he  was  a

military  man  by  day  and  he  was  a  janitor

at  night  I  used  to  go  with  him  and  help

clean  buildings  and

on  the  Presidio  so  and

and  though  I  dont  expect  everybody  to

work

16  hours  a  day  to  you  know  to  to  advance

himself  in  the  city

but  I

youre  saying  who  yeah  what  uh  could  the

age  group  uh  ethnicity  or  okay  my  wifes

a  teacher  was  a  teacher  my

former  wife  is  a  teacher  I  think  you

want

you  want

teachers

you  you  want  to  provide

a  stable  environment  for  people  that  are

going  to  teach  your  kids

you  want  health  care  workers  to  be  able

to  afford  to  live  here  you  want  all  your

service  workers  that  work  in  the  city

that  service  the  city  to  be  able  to

afford  to  live  here  if  if  rich  people

are  only  two  percent  or  one  percent  or

five  percent  of  the  population  then

um

you  know  the  other  percentage

uh  should  be  people  that  work  for  a

living

you  know  I  mean  I  I  think  I  think  wealth

is  overrepresented  here

an  equitable  distribution  youve  got  you

whats  set  in  place  is  what  seems

insurmountable

you  know  you  have  wealthy  people  that

arent  gonna  theyre  not  getting  off

their  ass  to  move  out  and  theyre  not

going  to  approve

um  development  in  their  community  and

its  going  to  change  the  nature  of  the

of  the  neighborhoods  that  everybody

admires

everybody  is  in  love  with  with  Pacific

Heights  everybody  is  in  love  with  Jordan

Park

you  know  those  are  parts  of  the  city

youre  oh  yeah  if  I  ever  get  money  I

want  to  live  there  too  and  you  dont

want  to  change  the  nature  of  those

places  but  youre  saying  youre  gonna

have  to  double  you  know  you  got  to

disincentivize  people

just  wanting  money

thats  what  it  is  thats  not  a  political

thing  its  its  its  its  a  social

engineering  of  thought  thats  going  to

change  it  its  not  going  to  be  like  I

say  you  can  build  all  the  houses  you

want  theyre  still  going  to  be  expensive

theyre  still  going  to  theyre  not  going

to  be  affordable  for  the  people  that

need  it

like  I  said  I  used  to  remember  I  I  know

I  I  knew  my  friends  had  single  mothers

that  worked  at

at

low  paying  jobs  that  actually  provided

housing  for  the  kids

in  the  city

you  know  and  I

youve  got  developers  in  charge  of  the

city

that  are  looking  to  maximize  their

profit

if  you  can  address  that

and  you  can  change  their  values  from

money  to  people  youll  have  a  different

city  youll  have  housing  for  people

youll  a  bunch  of  the  old  property

owners

are  willing  most  of  the  people  I  know

that  own

profit  the  old  folks  theyre  willing  to

rent  to  people  that  are  going  to  be

decent  to  them

that  are  going  to  be  decent  tenants

but  then  you  have  a  new  breed  of  tenant

that  comes  in  thats  my  rent  control

Department  you  cant  do  that  to  me

which  takes  that  part  of  the  market

offline  nobody  wants  to  rent  to  to

um  shiesty  tenants

you  know  and  if  they  do  rent  a  shiesty

tenants

you  want  to  get  as  much  as  you  can

because  you  never  know  when  youre  going

to  get  bitten

so  you  have  to  change

the  adversarial  nature  of  landlord  and

tenant

I  think  thats  part  of  the  solution

I  think  you  disincentivize  people  from

honing

huge  amounts  of  real  estate  or  that  real

estate  is  an  investment  you  have  to  look

at  it  as  a  home  for  people  and  that  that

is  valued  as  well  as

whatever  profit  you  can  make

so

theres  a  whole  lot  of  mindset  that  has

to  be  changed  and  you  cant  burden

maybe  you  can  you  can  stick  it  to

the  people  that  are  now  rich  in  homes

and  and

density  low

places  in  the  city  because  lets  face  it

they  prevented  a  lot  of  people  from

developing  over  the  years

and  yeah  thats  why  they  do  have  the

nature  that  I  mean  specifically  ice  has

this  nature  you  know  when  they  want  to

open  up  newcomer  school  to  foreign

students  and  troubled  kids  you  know  they

dont  want  people  out  of  the

neighborhood  or  going  to  schools  that

are  empty

you  know  they  you  know  the  politicians

themselves  in  the  city  are  are  a  block

on  on  housing

maybe  you  need  to  get  rid  of  some

politicians

so  please  correct  me  if  Im  not

understanding  you

um  so  it  seems  that  youre  saying  that

its  its  its

yeah  the  statements  dont  Jive  I  know  I

mean  I  I  like  old  neighborhoods

you  know  I  I  like  old  neighborhoods  and

I  want  to  see  some  kind  of  develop  in

those  neighbors  development  in  those

neighborhoods

and  um  I  think  rich  people  or  people  in

low  density  areas  have  to  trust  that

people  that  are  here  for  jobs  that  want

to  raise  their  kids  they  want  a  decent

neighborhood  too  and  theyre  not  going

to  butcher  their  neighborhoods

I  I  think  thats  the  way  the  city  has

been  run  I  think  theyve  theyve  opened

the  barn

theyve  opened  the  gates  to  developers

and  thats  gonna  thats  gonna  skew  the

way  the  city  goes  so  theyre  going  to

develop  in  the  cheapest  area  as  they  can

to  maximize  their  profit  and  and  if  you

if  you  if  you

commodify  housing

it  becomes

whatever  you  can  get  out  of  it

and  and  the  easiest  way  to  make  a  profit

is  find  the  cheapest  place  to  build

which  is  Hunters  Point  which  is  the

mission

you  know  is  the  cheapest  place  to  build

and  maximize  your  profit  which  runs

everybody  out  of  the  cheaper

neighborhoods

when  you  asked  that  question  is  my

valuation  me  considering  oh  I  dont  give

a  damn  about  Geneva

its  a  windy  empty  place  just  build  out

there

you  know  Geneva  Avenue  you  can  develop

the  hell  out  of  that

and  Im  sure  that  landlords  out  there

will  be  really  happy

they  just  make  sure  the  buses  go  out

there  and  yeah  theres  Parts  out  of

mission  that  need  some  density  but  you

also  need  density  and  Pacific  Heights

you  know  you  need  you  need  why  do  you

want  to  run  a  bus  four  miles  out  to  the

edge  of  the  city  when  you  all  you  have

to  do  is  make  a  walking  path  or  a

bicycle  path  to  downtown  from  Pacific

Heights

but  but  then  youre  contending  with

peoples  dreams  you  know  it  its  amazing

how  San  franciscans  will  are  just  people

in  general  will  fight

for  the  right  of  people  that  that  are

screwing  them  to  have  the  right  to  screw

them  because  someday  theyre  going  to  be

a  billionaire  that  someday  if  they  save

enough  money  theyre  going  to  live  in

Pacific

its  Out  Of  Reach  its  gone  thats  if  I

hit  the  lottery  Maybe

but  Im  not  gonna  Im  not  gonna  defend

uh  Daddy  Warbucks  right  to  screw  me

Im  not  and  its  it  is  a  beautiful

neighborhood  I  give  it  to  them  they

preserved

and  yeah  I  hate  to  see  it  go

but  you  know  but  the  weird  thing  is

development  takes  place  on  public

property  always

they  did  mind  taking  the  Presidio  from

us  Ill  tell  you  the  story  about  my

mother  when  she  got  out  of  the  car  when

we  just  we  had  just  came  from  France  in

64  and  she  out  of  the  car

looked  around  the  Presidio  thats  where

we  were  going  to  live  the  first  three

years  here  thats  where  I  lived  she

looked  around  and  said  oh  this  is  nice

this  is  much  too  nice  for  poor  people

that  was  her  comment  I  can  remember  that

was  only  five  or  six  years  it  was  six

years  old  then

its  too  nice  for  poor  people  because

poor  people  live  in  concrete  blocks

outside  of  the  city  and  and  thats  just

where  poor  people  live  so  they  dont

live  in  the  city  and  then  all  of  a

sudden  they  hatch  this  plan  to  make  San

Francisco  Manhattan

in  San  Francisco  is  Manhattan  and  it

costs  like  Manhattan  they  had  no  regard

for  workers  then  after  youve  converted

the  city  into  a  play  face  a  play  pay

place  for  rich  people  you  want  to  say  oh

well  we  want  to  give  poor  people  a  place

to  live  what  the  do  you  think

people  where  are  poor  people  can  live

after  youve  converted  a  city

nobody  is  serious  this  is  not  this  is

just  money  spent  on  idle  dreams

theres  no  place  its  47  square  miles  to

city

you  have

all  you  have

you  have  Sam  Bruno  you  have  South  City

you  have  Oakland  you  have  to  start  think

thinking  I  think  in  general  in  in  more

Regional  regionally

whos  going  to  live  where  make  sure  the

services  are  there  for  people  that  want

to  live  there  you  dont  want  to  go  out

to  Danville  and  live  in  an  apartment

building  right  on  the  on  the  bark  thats

thats  disgusting

gets  to  104  degrees  out  there

and  they  have  a  movie  house  or  two  and  a

car  dealership

and  and  then  everybody  else  gets  off

Bart  and  filters  out  to  the  apartments

thats  not  a  city

we  have  a  city

and  people  cant  afford  to  live  here  and

in  fact  I  think  the  population  in  the

city  is  going  down  so  why  are  we

building  houses

it  doesnt  make  sense

maybe  Im  just  a  plumber  but  Im  not  a

stupid  plumber

because  youre  talking  about  oh  we  want

to  put  all  these  billions  of  dollars  in

developing  housing  and  give  people

places  if  its  not  affordable  yeah  its

not  affordable  because  you  have  policies

that  dont

provide  for  affordability

and  all  youre  doing  is  saying  okay  now

were  going  to  build  more  more  houses

which  makes  the  policies  that  were  in

place

to  elevate  the  cost  of  housing

even  more

it  even  it  reinforces  those  if  youre

going  to  build  more  housing  its  not

going  to  lower  the  price  of  housing  its

just  going  to  make  it  more  unaffordable

the  way  theyve  gotten  well  and  and  the

state  maintain  mandates  it  because  they

want  them  they  want  they  want  public

money

to  reinforce  policies  that  already  exist

they  want  to  make  sure  that  downtown  in

San  Francisco  thats  30  MD  is  going  to

be

full  again

I  dont  give  a  if  this  thing  slides

into  the

Bay

I  dont

I  didnt  want  the  development  of  this

downtown  anyhow

what  would  we  have  when  I  first  got  here

was  700  000  people  150  000  people  more

are  in  the  city  we  have  all  of  these

Office  Buildings

and  its  only  150  000  150  000  people

more  from  when  I  got  here  I  think  I

think  maybe  it  was  six  hundred  thousand

that  was  seven  or  eight  hundred  thousand

maybe  not  even  that

so  its  not  commensurate  so  we  built  all

of  this  downtown  nobody  lives  in  it

all  the  south  of  Market  flop  houses  are

gone  you  got  people  living  on  the  street

being  on  the  sidewalks

theres  no  attention

to  those  folks  they  dont  care  about

poor  people  it  it  its  a  non-profit

racket

a  billion  dollars  a  year

to  scrape  crap  off  the  street

and  then  the  city  pays  I  dont  know  how

much  the  house  people  that  live  up  that

that  are  marginal

that  may  or  may  not  be  from  San

Francisco

it  doesnt  make

any  sense  and  were  paying  for  police  to

patrol  empty  streets  downtown

stupid

and  then  they  worry  about  where  were

going  to  build  a  house  so  we  can  were

so  basically  planning  is  gonna

codify  this  bullet

and

and  provide  unaffordable  housing  the

plans  were  can  in  hand  with  Woods

existing

if  youre  going  to  start  a  new  game  what

you  do  is  whack  the  board  clean

and  you  say  okay  we  have  a  density  of

six  units  for  lot

in  every  neighborhood  every  neighborhood

thats  what  weve  done

how  can  you  do  it  when  one  of  the Lots

in  a  neighborhood  is  three  million

dollars  I  think  its  disingenuous  I

think  because  its  not  going  to  happen

in  neighborhoods  that  value  property

value

is  such  that  its  prohibitive

you  know  yeah

you  could  tear  down  my  if  I  had  a  place

in  the  in  the  in  the  Richmond  a  little

house  on  a  lot  Big  Lot  that  would  only

cost  okay  1.2

okay  then  I  can  put  six  units  on  that

yeah  Id  buy  that  and  put  six  units  up

changes  the  nature  of  the  Richmond

but  you  have  a  house  thats

4.5  million  on  the  same  size  lot

in  the  sunset  I  mean  in  in  in  in

where  is  it  Presidio  highs  or

Pacific  Heights  Im  not  going  to  buy

that  its  going  to  stay  the  same  nature

so  I  I  dont  know  how  you  make  it  equal

for  everybody  I  dont

I  dont

I  like  a  quiet  neighborhood  though  Id

love  to  have  a  a

thousand  square  foot  house  on  a  lot  in

Pacific  ice  I  love  to  have  that

you  know  but  its  not  realistic

and  its  not  realistic  that  everybody

lives  in  in

2200  square  feet  two  cars

um

you  know

goes  away  to  Baja  its  its  its  kind  of

unrealistic  but  everybody  wants  that

lifestyle

because  theyre  poor

its  easy  its  easy  theyre  poor  theyre

black  theyre  minorities  you  dont  give

it  about  them  why  arent  we  because

thats  where  you  push  people  out

I  know  people  that  were  raised  in  the

Bayview  when  it  was  I  I  knew  a  woman  was

raised  in  the  debut  Chinese  woman  whos

raised  in  the  Bay  View  when  it  was

butcher  town

the  resources  werent  put  there

I  mean  yeah  they  just  let  polluters  they

let  the  butchers  just

flesh  flush  dead  meat  out  into  the  The

Story  Goes

they  would  go  theyd  theyd  bait  dogs

with  rats  Terriers

and  theyd  go  to  Butchertown

out  by  the  Bayview

to  get  the  rats

because  those  rats  were  the  biggest

baddest  rats  in  the  city

thats  where  all  the  remains  of  the

butcherries  or  I  forget  what  they  call

it  theres  a  actually  a  name  for  it  but

thats  where  they  flushed  it  out  to  the

Bay

well  you  know  first  you  you  stopped

trying  to  cater  to

Gourmet

um

shopping  centers  or  you  know  you  go  to

Whole  Food  or  something  where  its

prohibitive  to  buy  food  I  think

um

you  provide  good  grocery  stores  you

provide  also  maybe  medical  buildings

because  there  used  to  be  medical

buildings  all  over  the  city  I  mean  there

was  French  America  and  guys  or  mountains

I  Im  thinking  about  the  Richmond

District  though  but  it  is  pretty  theres

UC  but  there  werent  concentrated  in

just  one  portion  of  the  city

think  thats  a  business  decision  on  the

part  of  the  medical  providers  they  could

have  clinics  that  are  smaller  and  less

dense

campuses

you  know  I  mean  you  want  to  provide

places  for  people  to  get  health  care  you

want  to

for  people  to  educate  themselves

you  know  I  dont  mean  you  know

City  College  is  fine  if  you  have  buses

going  to  City  College  you  can  have  one

place  and  yeah

consolidate

you  know  I  mean  you  make  decisions  about

where  you  want  things  to  be  consolidated

and  and  just  forget  about

but  you  have  to  make  it

you  have  to  make  it  so  people  get  to  it

you  know  you  maybe  put  30  bus  lines  to

City  College  from  every  place  in  the

city  you  dont  cut  the  bus  lines  because

it  doesnt  have  the  people  or  whatever

you  know  um

you  just  provide  buses  all  over  the  city

for  people  to  go  around  back  and  forth

then  then  theres  no  need  for  them  to

have  the  cars

you  know  you  can  stop  the  planning  for

bus  routes  I  mean  for  for  city  streets

you  dont  you  dont  design  the  streets

for

what  they  call  it  whats  this  new

driving  self-driving

yeah  you  dont  design  streets  for

autonomous  vehicles  you  design  them  for

bus  routes

and  I  think  I  think  the  idea  now  is

autonomous  vehicles  another  profit

making

proposition  for  this  everything  the  city

does  is  to  make  somebody  some  money

its  not  they  dont  give  a  damn  about

people

its  obvious

anybodys  almost  receiving  and  knows

theyre  getting  screwed

theyre  paying  taxes  for  nothing

you  got  a  university  run  up  on  the  hill

we  got  UCSF  you  have

up  the  nether  Hill  you  have  USF  a

medical  building  you  have  St  Marys  a

hospital

five  blocks  down  the  street

you  have  Golden  Gate  Park  if  you  go  into

the  pan  thatll  even  walk  all  the  way  to

the  beach  two  and  a  half  three  miles

without  going  out  of  a  park  I  think

after  you  get  into  go  and  get  bark  there

in  those  streets  you  just  go

okay  and

you  know  you  go  across  it  theres  the

hate  its  just  thats  whats  weird  about

it  everybody  will  invest  as  long  as  they

make  billions  millions  of  dollars  nobody

wants  to  invest  on  on  a  10  margin

you  know  I  think  you  have  the  incentive

Vise  I  I  think  if  they  build  something

thats  huge

they  make  a  lot  of  money  they  pay  a  lot

of  taxes

they  pay  a  lot  not  not  reasonable  taxes

a  lot  of  taxes  you  tax  the  hell  out  of

their  profits  and  make  it

incentive

and  then  you  have  different  people  with

different  ideas  of  how  to  develop  and

they

um  and  and  and  these  are  just

machinations  these  are  just

I  know  theyre  not  practical  I  know  that

um

yeah  whats  nice  about  the

the

um

north  of  Panhandle  in  a  Richmond  that

area

Goliath  Park  its  wonderful

thats  wonderful  they  had  they  used  to

have  corner  stores  a  lot  of  those  are

closing

used  to  have  more  churches

I  think  for  capita

than  any  other  place  in  the  city  they

had  all  kind  of  storefront  churches  used

to

development  took  over

what  was  important  to  me  was

education  the  enrichment  programs

I  mean

but  there  was  a  difference  for  different

people

I  mean  when  I  went  to  Winfield  Scott  as

a  army  brat

they  were  integrating  San  Francisco  back

in

early  60s

and  they  would  ship  in  kids  from  the

Fillmore

to  Winfield  Scott  Winfield  Scott  is  now

clearly  lillianthal  in  the  Marina

District

when  they  shipped  when  they  talked  about

um

what  do  you  call  integration  they  would

ship  to  people  from  The  Fillmore  in  to

Winfield  Scott  but  they  would  they  would

go  to  separate  classes

youd  have  one  side  of  the  playground

all  black

the  other  side  because  I  was  an  Army  rat

I  was  in  the  white  side  of  the

playground

so  they  had  integration

but  they  didnt  integrate

on  on the  books

it  was  supposedly  happening

but  they  separated  the  kids

and  then  when  I  went  to  Andrew  Jackson

all  the  school  supplies  were  all

up

um  death  squirrel  and  disarray  teachers

were  having  breakdowns

kids  were  bad  but  they  had  lousy

teachers

and  then  I  got  into  a  fight  with

somebody  and  the  guy

put  a  couple  of  stitches  in  my  eye  my

mother  said  youre  not  going  to  school

anymore  I  went  down  down  the  road  a  mile

and  a  half  to  Argonne

and  they  were  throwing  away  brand  new

books

week  at  Andrew  Jackson  they  were

studying  out  of  ragged  books  and  in

Oregon  theres  throwing  away  brand  new

books  I  mean  old  book

in  Andrew  Jackson  they  were  studying  out

of  raggedy  books  and  when  I  went  to

Oregon  they  were  throwing  away  the  same

books  that  were  brand  new  never  passed

out

because  they  were  changing  over  to  new

books

so  resources

theres  a  discrepancy  in  resources

and  I  think  its  been  institutionalized

and  or  was  now  theyre  saying  its  not

but  its  kind  of  late  after  youve

ruined  a  school  district  to  then  say  Oh

we  want  to  change  it  all

right  yeah  theres  a  lot  of  disingenuous

stuff  going  on  here  everybody  says

theyre  doing  something  to  change  things

planning  is  doing  things  to  change

things  I  dont  see  where  its  happening

Youre  Building  big  buildings  that  costs

a  lot  of  money

and  youre  going  to  put  people  in  those

buildings  with  money

thats  the  nature  of  development  in  San

Francisco  if  youre  committed  to  having

families  here  you  have  to  start

developing  as  they  cost  a  lot  less  or  or

the  city  is  going  to  have  to  just

subsidize  them

oh  yeah  mixed  neighborhoods

people  of  different  finances  living  side

by  side

um

you  know  people  of  different  values

living  side  by  side

this  Presidio  for  me  it  was  subsidized

housing  the  government  paid  for  by

housing  a  government  made  sure  that  I

got  a  good  school  right  in  summertime  I

got  out  in  the  middle  of  the  you  know

early  in  the  morning  and  I  played  until

the  sun  went  down  that  was  my  existence

for

thresidia  I  think  that  could  be  in  San

Francisco  the  same  thing

in  San  Francisco  in  general

but  I  think  because  it  was  subsidized  by

the  government  profit  was  not  the  motive

and  people  have  to  recognize  that  if

they  develop  that  theres  theres  no

theres  no  pot  of  gold  at  the  end  of  the

rainbow

that  theyre  doing  it  because  they  want

us  a  city  that  has

a  mixture  of  people  rich  and  poor  black

and  white

you  know

perspective  you  know

but

yeah  thats  thats  what  they  want  they

want  they  they  also

want  the  services  for  all

not  just  rich  people  who  who  are

dissatisfied  with  not  having  it  their

way  so  they  go  and  and  create  their  own

services

yeah

you  know

um  yeah  they  got  it  in  Senate  they  they

have  to  be  committed  to  the  idea  of  San

Francisco

San  Francisco  I  grew  up in

but  nobody  is  everybodys  committed  to

money  now

thats  kind  of  idealistic  and

but  um

yeah  I  mean  fly  shacker  gave  back  he

made  a  pool

you  know  De  Young

Museum

there  was  who  was  that

um

flood  I  dont  know  if  flood  was  a

but

rich  people  used  to  give  back  to  the

city  because  they  got  from  the  city

and  you  need  a

a  new  um

class  of  rich  people  that  thinks  thats

what  they  need  to  do  not  because  its

beneficial  for  taxes  or

whatever  but  they  understand  I  and  this

is  what  was  explained  to  me

that  when  they  go  to  the  nice  little

parties

that  if  you  have  a  bunch  of  poor  people

living  around  you

you  dont  come  back  too  much  in  your

house

and  in  order  to  you  pay  insurance

everybody  pays  insurance

pay  insurance  you  get  back  to  the  city

because  the  city  has  granted  you  a

Wonderful  Life

and  part  of  the  insurance  is  that  the

people  less  than  you  want  a  wonderful

life  too
