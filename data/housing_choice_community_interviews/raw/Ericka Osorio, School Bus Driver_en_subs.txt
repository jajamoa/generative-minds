uh  my  name  is  Eric  alsorio  I  currently

live  in  the  Diamond  Heights  area

and  uh  what  do  you  do  for  work  right  now

I  am  a  part-time  school  bus  driver

so  I  grew  up  in  San  Francisco

so  my  mom  where  we  lived  at  now  so  since

I  lived  with  my  mother  when  they  opened

the  wait  list  I  applied  so  since  I

already  lived  in  that  housing  area

basically  I  got  first  picked  because  I

was  already  living  in  the  housing

and  who  lives  with  you  now

just  my  daughter  and  then  my  grandmother

basically

and  why  does  your  grandmother  stay  with

you

um  I  do  help  take  care  of  her  but  she

does  have  her  own  place  but  just  because

shes  elderly

um  might  try  to  help  her

um

I  could  say  that  it  has  affected  my

loved  ones  because

um

theres  not  enough  programs  to  help

and

theres  not  enough

wait  lists  I  would  say  because  I  do  have

family  members  who  do  live  with  friends

because  theres  no  theres  not  theres

not  enough  help

you  noticed  people  that  had  to  either

leave  San  Francisco  or  like  you  said

live  with  one  another

yes  because  theres  no  help

well  people  leave  San  Francisco  because

of  their  choice  oh  its  expensive  first

but

live  with  other  people  because  theres

just  not  enough  help  or  if  its  too

expensive

what  do  they  have  to  do  yeah  basically

get  a  roommate  or  just  cut  back  on  stuff

or  even  just  even  share  a  studio

and  do  you  know  like  the  people  that

leave  this  video  do  you  know  their

professions  like  are  there  other  school

bus  drivers  that  cant  afford  to  live  in

San  Francisco  and  you  know  where  in  the

Bay  Area  did  they  have  to  move  to  a  lot

of  them  do  live  in  like  Fairfield

Antioch  bus  drivers

well  I  would  say  like  before  the

pandemic  to  it  the  pandemic  did  a  lot

because

um

I  dont  know  if  you  guys  know  but  um

Horseman  you  guys  are  a  horse  man

so  you  know  a  lot  of  people  in  that  area

well  that  went  to  that  school  thats

they  basically  turned  that  gym  into

housing  for  people  who

all  kids  that  attended  that  school

so

um

an  impact  that  Community  a  lot  too  what

impacts  myself  first  because  you  know  I

have  to  limit  myself  to  what  I  can  and

cannot  afford

but  it  also  impacts

you  know  single  families  or  people  who

have  more  than  one  child

um  my  father  hes  a  single  parent  and

hes  not  well  hes  a  citizen  now  but  you

know  hes  not  a  full  citizen  so  he

doesnt  get  the  help  that  a  lot  of

people  can  get

um

the  people  that  you  know  from  before  the

pandemic  they  still  dont  have  houses  so

theyre  still  living  out  of  the  gym

so  I  think  it

attacks  a  lot  of  people

I  personally  think  the  housing  crisis

will  probably  get  worse

as  the  years  go  on

Im  not  even  sure  if  well  even  be  here

in  San  Francisco

um  its  just  too  expensive  out  here  I

dont  think  we  do  have  rent  control  out

here  I  know  that  for  sure  but  I  feel

like  the  landlords  the  property  managers

just  raise  the

uh  the  uh

what  do  you  want  to  call  it

the  payment  to  whatever  the  payment

center  whatever  they  want  to  raise  it  to

were  able  to  walk  up  the  street  and  go

to  the  park

another  aspect  is  we  have

theres  a  few  Parks  actually  around  in

the  neighborhood  theres  a  dog  park  as

well

theres  a  grocery  store  CVS

um

and  then  down  the  street  theres  Bart

and  we  have  public  transportation  so

thats  a  good  for  all  of  us

um  we  do  have  good  schools  we  have

what  was  it  clearly  I  thought  no  its

not  clear  oh  my  God

uh  rooftop  is  up  there  so  its  K  through

eighth  grade  the  only  thing  is  they

dont  have  Spanish  Immersion  so  I  dont

want  my  daughter  to  learn  how  to  speak

Spanish  and  there  is

um

Claritin  Claritin  I  think  is  only

kindergarten  through  fifth  grade  but

they  dont  as  well  they  dont  have

Spanish  Immersion  but  those  are  one  of

the  top  public  schools  that  I  would  send

my  daughter  to

um  I  think  more  so  for  her  I

think  uh  for  now  I  think  shes

scared  to  be  alone

um  I  do  she  doesnt  know  how  to  cook

anymore  so  I  cook  for  her

um  just  to  help  her  I  think  you  know

elderly  people  when  they  get  older

they  need  the  companionship  so  I  think

thats  what

Miley  and  I  are  there  for  I  mean  she  has

her  own  place  we  go  there  every  day

to  check  her  mail  and  to  go  inside

but

I  think  its  just  more  so  the

companionship  that  she  needs  now  that

shes  getting  older

she  would  have  to  leave  and  go  somewhere

else  she  actually  did  a  few  years  ago

so  and  then  she  came  back

and  if  your  grandmother  was  to  stay  on

her  own  and  for  you  to  feel  comfortable

for  your  elderly  family  member  to  stay

on  your  own  what  sort  of  amenities  and

resources  would  you  need  for  you  to  feel

comfortable  for  her  to  stay  on  her  own

for  her  to  stay  on  her  own

I  would  like  for  her  to  have  like  a

community  center  for  elderly  people  in

her  community  that  she  lives  in

I  would  love  for  her  to  have  her  own

washer  and  dryer  in  her  own  unit  not  in

like  you  know  for  her  somewhere  for  her

to  walk  because  I  feel  like  her  carrying

all  that  back  and  forth  is  she  might

fall

even  though  she  does  have  one  at  her

house  she  doesnt  wash  this  she  washes

that  mine  even  though  I  have  stairs  but

um  shes  at  my  house  I  Im  okay

um

they  have  a  gym  there  but  my  grandma

likes  to  walk  so  she  goes  on  walks  with

my  daughter  and  the  dog

so  I  think  a  community  center  for

elderly  people  at  her

housing  would  be  good

I  would  say  the  mission  even  though  its

not  the  best

but  they  have

most  of  the  bus  stops  on  Mission  Street

theres  a  lot  of  Resource  Centers  over

there

um  it  might  not  be  like  right  on  Mission

Street  but  they  have

a  lot  of  resources  over  there  theres  a

lot  of  schools  off  of  Mission  Street

just  by  driving  the  school  buses  I  know

where  you  know  the  schools  are  at

um

and  being

like  working  with  the  Housing  Industry

before  I  you  know  know  what  programs

people  were  able  to  go  to  to  go  get

assistance  with  like  deposits  and  stuff

like  that  so

um  a  lot  of  it  is  in  the  mission

for  resources

I  think  I  would  probably  want  to  move

like  to

um

what  would  you  call  it  whats  that

neighborhood  over  there  by  the  ballpark

dog  pass  yeah  the  doll  patch  I  just

think  over  there  because

I  dont  know  its  hot  over  there

the  suns  always  out  and  its  by  the

ballpark  and  we  can  just  walk

and  its  by  the  piercing  and  we  dont

have  to  walk  too  far  its  just

attractions  over  there  but  my  house  is

its  just  a  park

Dog  Patch  area

um  just  any  like

I  mean  downtown  they  are  building  some

but  I  feel  like  when  they  build  downtown

theyre  making  it  so  expensive  for

people  to  not  be  able  to  afford

or  theyre  aiming  for  the  Richer  people

um

or  they  can  build  where  theres  any

empty  lots

somewhere  where

just  make  it  affordable  for  people

um  some  of  the  kids

majority  of  the  kids  go  further  out  from

their  neighborhood  because  I  do  pick  up

special  needs  kid

kids  so  they  go  wherever

the  school  is  that  they  have  that  the

needs  that  they  need

and  which  areas  are  you  Servicing  I  pick

up  everywhere  and  what  areas  of  the  city

do  you  notice  have  better  resource  for

special  needs



um

I  would  say  all  of  them  because  I  know  a

lot  of  the

so  I  do  normally  drop  off  more  towards

the  Avenues  the  sunset  area

um

say  more  over  there  has  more

for  special  needs

a  community

for  elderly  people  or  just  like  an

after-school  program

for  kids

I  dont  know  if  the  one  up  there  is

still  open

um

I  would  like  for  there  to  be  a  bus

to  pick  up  from  private  schools  because

I  had  dont  I  dont  see  that  and  that

would  be  helpful  for  me

because  I  have  to  pick  her  up  make  a

time  to  pick  her  up

in  my  row

um

that  would  help  a  lot  because  my

grandmother  was  getting  old  she  cant

pick  her  up  and  Miley  doesnt  like  to

walk  up  hills

oh

its  its  hard

I  would  like  Miley  to  stay  in  San

Francisco

um

I  dont  know  if  it  will  be  possible

depending  on  how

the  payment  standard  will  be  when  she

gets  older

when  I  get  older  I  dont  know  if  its

going  to  be  affordable

but  I  mean  we  all  grew  up  here  her

familys  here  I  would  want  her  to  be

here

well  see  you  know  its  hard

they  gotta  make  it  affordable

Carnival  for  sure

um

I  would  say  420  but  I  dont  smoke

personally

but  I  feel  like  you  know

it  brings  out

event  different  vendors  for  people  even

though  its  not  just  marijuana  you  know

people  come  out  there  to  sell  their  food

their  clothing  whatever  it  is  that  they

make

um  they  do  the  food  truck  stuff

you  know  those  people  they  have

so  food  their  food  is  probably  better

than  the  restaurant  sometimes

um

what  else

I  mean  Im  pretty  sure  they  have  little

events  sometimes  I  dont  know  everything

about  but  those  are  fine

probably  just  Mission  Street  in  Golden

Gate  Park

um

I  want  to  say  elderly  people  I  think

because  theyre

elderly  they  probably  give  them  like

a  push  to  the  side  like  oh

you  can  go  sit  with  your  family  or

whatever  but  you  know  some  of  them  may

not  have  family  here  or  you  know  theyre

the  last  of  their  family  or

anything  could  have  happened  and  they

probably  just  tell  them  go  live  in  an

old  folks  home  or  whatever  because  you

know  like  my  grandma  but  um  I  think  they

theyre  the  most  vulnerable

a  thriving  Community  is  everybody  in  the

community  working  together  coming

together  and  keeping  your  community  safe

my  hopes  for  the  future  for  housing  is

um  I  hope  that  they  can  build  enough

housing  for  everybody

um

in  my  hopes  for  San  Francisco  as  a  whole

is  that  they  can  get  it  together

even  with  the  homeless  people  I  mean  I

know  its  not  its  hard  I  mean  but

everybody  deserves  a  chance

so  why  do  you  think  there  is  a  housing

crisis  right  now

I  think  that

just  from  being

working  in  the  inside

um

there  was  a  shortfall  so  working  for  the

Housing  Authority

there  was  a  a  shortfall  so  I  feel  like

there  was  too  many  housing  vouchers

given  out

and  not  enough

like

it  was  too  much  money  dished  out
