um  my  name  is  Shayla

um  I  am  actually  from  Idaho  and  I  moved

here  about  five  years  ago

um  to  the  bay  and  then  I  moved  to  San

Francisco  about  four  years  ago

Im  currently  a  our  educator  I  teach

ceramics  at  George  Washington  High

yeah  yeah  definitely

um  its  always

funny  to  talk  about  my  first  apartment

that  I  rented  to  people  from  the  bay

because  its  it  just  doesnt  happen  out

here  so  when  I  was  in  college  I  had

roommates  and  then  my  first  apartment

that  I  owned  it  was  a  one  bedroom

apartment  and  I  paid  650  a  month  for

that

and  it  was  a  decent  apartment  it  was  it

was  livable  it  was  great  parking

included  lots  of  space

um  and  then  I  uh  was  working  for  a  job

once  I  graduated  at  college  with  my  BFA

I

spontaneously  moved  out  to  the  bay  to

help  support  that  job  and  was  a  regional

manager  for  a  while

during  that  time

it  was  retail  oriented  and  I  didnt  want

to  let  go  of  my  my  Arts  intentions  so  I

started  interning  with  a  incredible

sculptor  an  artist  named  John  Toki  in

Richmond

um

and  hes  actually  who  was  able  to

connect  me  to  the  job  at  George

Washington  teaching  ceramics

um  and  connected  me  to  the  previous

teacher  Jamin  ziegart  and  thats

basically  the  reason  why  I  moved  out  to

San  Francisco  from  where  I  was

previously  living

here  in  San  Francisco  though  has  been

quite  the  journey  Im  Ive  moved  every

single  year  that  Ive  lived  here  for

various  reasons  whether  its  taking

advantage  of  the  pandemic  prices  or

noticing  something  in  my  lease  was  a

little  less  than  legal

uh  and  its  just  yeah  um

we  live  in  the  sunset  right  now  me  and

my  partner  and  honestly  if  I  didnt  have

a  partner  I  wouldnt  I  dont  think  I

would  have  been  able  to  afford  to  live

out  here  as  easily  as  I  have

um so  we  actually  started  in  Marin  uh  it

was  just  really  easy  to  get  into  a  place

in  San  Rafael  and  so  the  first  year  I

was  teaching  I  was  commuting  back  and

forth  and  then  we  found  a  place  in  the

sunset

um we  would  have  stayed  there  forever  if

it  wasnt  for  the  landlord  needing  to

remodel  the  home  but  she  already  like

set  us  up  with  that  uh  knowledge

beforehand

um

so

after  that  we  moved  to  the  mission  which

honestly  I  love  it  the  weather  theres

incredible  always  sunny  and  theres

always  something  going  on  but  that  was

the  apartment  that  had  the  sketchy

landlord  situation

um  in  the  lease  somewhere  they  had

written  that  basically  if  anything  were

to  go  wrong  in  the  apartment  that  was

our  fall  and  that  wed  be  liable  for  it

like  including  Plumbing

and  we  had  talked  to  the  neighbors  and

the  previous  tonight  moved  for  that

reason  as  well  because  they  were  going

to  make  them  pay  for  the  entire  Plumbing

again  so  we  just  had  to  get  out  of  there

even  though  we  love  the  area

and

it  was  actually  I  think  the  hardest  to

move  this  time  in  this  last  year  we  just

moved  to  the  sunset  again

um

in  a  great  Spot  close  to  the  beach  and

close  to  Golden  Gate  so  I  cant  get

angry  I  lost  the  sun

um  but  it  was  definitely  very  tricky  to

find  this  place  because  of  the  prices

just  have  gone  up  quite  a  bit  recently

and  its  just  not  a  renters  market  so

this  one  was  probably  the  most  difficult

to  get  into

um  and  transitioning  between  those

places  there  were  times  that  we  had  to

move  in  with  family  and  be  houseless

because  there  was  just  not  enough

of  a  cushion  or  we  are  not  set  up  with

like  a  safety  net  of  funds  to  be  able  to

just  jump  right  into  anything  so

for  a  few  of  them  yes  I  know  its  a

little  trickier  for  the  younger

um  teachers  uh  mostly  because  a  lot  of

us  have  moved  into  San  Francisco  looking

for  opportunity  in  that

um

but  I  also  know  that  one  of  my

co-workers  has  not  moved  in  15  years

because  they  dont  want  to  lose  their

grandfathered  rent  and  they  do  need  a

new  place  thats  bigger  but  they  just

cant  afford  to  move  into  that  so  I

think  the  sentiment  does

align  a  lot  of  it  but  um  there  are  some

features  that  have  some  partners  that

work  in  Tech  that  are  fortunate  to  like

be  able  to  use  them  to  be  able  to  get

into  housing  but  its

its  rare  that  you  hear  a  teacher  being

able  to  do  it  all  by  themselves

oh  yeah

um  I  think  the  biggest  impact  coming

from  Idaho  is  like  having  a  little  lower

rent  and  being  able  to  get  out  of  the

house  sooner  I  could  afford  to  live  on

my  own

um  many  of  my  students  are  banking  on

the  fact  that  they  can  live  with  their

parents  to  be  able  to  also  afford

college  and  not  be  so  in  debt  starting

out  and  so  I  think  having

um  plus  access  to  affordable  housing  and

housing  in  general  makes  it  really  hard

for

um

the  youth  in  the  city  to  be  able  to  be

more  independent  right  away  and  be  able

to  live  on  their  own  or  with  roommates

because  its  its  really  not  in  their

mindset  to  think  of  that  because  when  I

was  younger  like  you  wanted  to  move  out

as  soon  as  youre  18  and  do  that  but

many  students  dont  get  to  move  out

until  theyre  done  with  college

how  have  you

have

um  theyre  really  reliant  on  their

parents  which  is  unfortunate

whether  its  having  their  since  their

parents  helping  pay  for  college  and

housing  whether  its  doing  the  major

that  their  parent  wants  them  to  do  and

following  in  that  line  and  making

families  happy  versus  being  able  to

have  the  authority  to  like  oh  I  cant

afford  this  I  dont  want  to  make  my  own

autonomous  decisions  and  do  what  I  truly

want  to  do

um

but  I  always  look  at  it  from  a  very

humanitarian  aspect  and  like  an  Arts

aspect  so  I  always  look  at  that  side  of

things

its  honestly  not  super  comfortable  to

where  I  grew  up  because  I  grew  up in  a

very  rural  Town  less  than  5  000  people

um  so  thats  basically  double  the

population  of  the  students  at  wash  so

its  really  not  comparable

um

I  feel  like  the  thing  that  gets  me  is

that  there  is  so  much  housing  available

thats  empty  and  just  not  affordable

that  makes  it  such  an  issue  because

theres  a  ton  of  buildings  tunnel

Apartments

um

all  over  the  city  and  theres  a  lot  that

are  empty  uh  and  I  think  thats  the  part

that  gets  me  because  there  is  housing

available

um  its  just  not  accessible

yeah  well  I  mean  making  housing

accessible  to  Residents  is  going  to

benefit  any  city

um

I  definitely  dont  have  an  answer  to

this  but  I  know  what  impact  it  has  so  if

we  have  accessible  housing  youre  going

to  be  able to  have  more  native  residents

going  to  be  able  to  become  teachers

going  to  be  able  to  stay  in  the  city

rather  than  having  to  go  elsewhere  to

either  find  their  career  or  even  like  be

able  to  find  a  place  for  their  family

um  and  so  if  we  make  it  more  accessible

for  students  like  well  have  more

retention  so  the  youth  that  we  are

educating  in  the  city  will  stay  in  the

city  and  make  it  better

um  and  then  theyll  become  teachers  and

know  what  their  City  needs  so  thats  the

whole  idea  about  education  is  being  able

to  make  it

accessible  and  make  it  better  and  that

that  can  be  easily  translated  sorry  my

hair  is  in  my  eye  uh  translated  to

housing  I  feel

um

just  because

oh  absolutely  so

um

the  choice  of  living  impacts  quality  of

life  I  see  the  janitor  in  there

impacts  quality  of  life  uh

so  like  I  would  I  have  lived  in  places

where  families  have  like

six  people  in  a  one-bedroom  apartment  as

a  neighbor

um

and  I

dont  think  a  lot  of  people  will

actually  choose  that  as  their  life

because  its  not  really  a  place  where

you  have  space  to  live  and  grow  and

develop  lack  of  privacy  that  kind  of

thing

so  having  choices  to  where  to  live

definitely  impacts  quality  of  life  and  I

know  a  lot  of  like  housing  developments

or  like  affordable  housing  focus  on

making  new  and  cheap  things  and  I  dont

know  if  thats  necessarily  the  solution

um  not  only  because  theres  a  lot  of

empty  housing  available  but  because  that

that  also  restricts  where  they  can

choose  to  live  which  no  one  wants  to  be

dictated  where  they  can  live  whether  it

be  apartments  or  like  a  house  that  they

would  want  to  have  a  backyard  and  care

for  that  kind  of

yeah  so

um

so  I  feel  like  living  in  Sunset  is  very

lucky  enough  for  me  already  because  its

really  not  that  far  in  distance  but

being  able  to  live  like  in  Richmond

around  the  school  would  be  fantastic

because  then  I  would  be  immersed  in  the

community  my  students  are  immersed  in

and  then  I  would  be  able  to  really  see

what  the  neighborhoods  need  and  what

they  need  to  focus  on  for  like  their

wants  and  needs  and  I  would  be  more

immersed  in  the  community  as  a  culture

um and  just  the  housing  around  the

school  I  work  at  is  not  accessible

already  Richmond  is  known  to  be  a  little

bit  more  expensive  uh  I  dont  think  wed

be  able  to  afford  a  one  bedroom  for  a

couple  years  uh  until  my  salary  goes  up

so  it  just  would  be  a  little

it  just  would  be  better

you  dont  have  to  commute  so  far  there

are  some  teachers  that  commute  like  from

Sausalito  or  Marin

um  even  some  that  commute  from

um

Pacifica  and  so  just  because  its  more

affordable  to  live  there

um  yeah  I  mean  adding  housing  into  the

mission  and  and  already  extremely

densely  populated  side  of  the  city  seems

counterintuitive  to  me

um  even  though  that  side  of  the  city

does  have  access  to  like  better

transportation  more  frequent  stops  more

buses

um

in  that  in  general

um

its  really  hard  to  plan  to  travel

through  Muni  or  buses  on  this  side  of

the  city

um  and  so  having  more  development  on

this  side  even  though  its  more  suburban

and  more  family  oriented  would  actually

be  good  because  more  families  would  move

over  here  into  a  more  settled  area

um

and  it  would  make  transformation  work

accessible  because  they  would  have  to

have  more  buses  I  know  so  many  of  my

students  that  have  to  either  go  a  bus

ahead  of  the  normal  bus  or  a  bus  behind

and  sacrifice  being  late  to  school

because  theres  just  its  too  full

because  theres  not  enough

coming  back  and  forth  so  I  guess  that

leads  to  more  of  a  transportation  thing

than  a  housing  thing  but

I  would  say  this  site  is  probably  could

use  a  little  bit  more

in  that  regard

I  would  well  easily  like  low  income

which  is  like  most  of  the  city  so  a  lot

of  the  city  is  below  the  party  line  for

how  much  things  cost  around  here

um

and  that  alone  just  makes  it  really

really  desperate

um  theres  a  lot  of  families  that  do

come  like  immigrant  over  that  do  have  a

little  bit  more  money  are  able  to

sustain  that  but  its  honestly  so  hard

to  pick  a  certain  population  because

everyones  affected  in  such  different

ways  whether  it  be  they  have  more

siblings  because  its  more  culturally

appropriate  to  have  siblings  and

families  super  important

um

or  theyre  not  having  so  many  siblings

they  have  to  save  their  money  and  make

sure  they  have  money  for  college  for

their  kids  or  its  a  family  that  has

its  just  so  hard  to  do  the  disparity

and  like  pick  and  choose  because  Ive

seen  students  that  fit  every  category

um  multiple  categories  that  fit  multiple

areas  its  just  really  hard  to  see  that

but  I  would  say  that  income  really  truly

is  the  biggest  disparity  uh  because  with

income  comes  out  of  privilege

like  living  in  the  mission  versus  living

in  Sunset  is  quite  different  especially

at  night  in  the  mission  theres  more

meaning  more  Transportation  more  noise

more  people  are  out  later  so  you  dont

get  as  quality  of  late  nights  versus

here  its  like  you  hear  crickets  in  the

night  you  know

um

so  all  of  that  really  impacts  everything

and  where  you  live  and  having  money

control  that  also  impacts  that

I  mean  it  would  be  a  miracle  to  get  Bart

or  anything  out  on  this  side  but  I  think

thats  long  gone

um

yeah  uh  I  think  thats  I  dont  know  I

think  that  might  be  on  my  the  biggest  on

my  wish  list  because  that  it  makes  it  so

difficult  to  transport  to  other  areas  of

the  bay

um

that  way  but

just  more  routes  more  options  more  buses

running  at  peak  times  maybe  even  just

like  throwing  an  extra  one  when  school

closes  or  opens

um

especially  because  I  dont  know  if  the

city  Muni  talks  to  the  district  to

school  district

um  all  schools  in  the  city  now  start  and

end  at  the  same  time

every  single  School

um  and  so  thats  like  a  lot  of  capacity

all  at  once  either  coming  in  or  leaving

and  so

I  dont  know  if  communication  between

Apartments  is  important

um  but  like  people  getting  off  of  work

around  four  oclock

meet  the  same  high  school  students

getting  off  at  that  time  and  so  those

buses  are  just  Bonkers  Ill  even  have

students  wait

an  hour  after  school  just  hanging  out  in

my  room  just  because  they  like  I  really

dont  want  to  deal  with  the  next  three

buses  that  are  going  to  be  just  packed

um

and  so  I  think  thats  important  too

because  I  think  theres  a  lot  of

decisions  that  are  made  in  different

branches  of  the  city  that  they  might  not

have  communication  so  I  dont  know  if

that  has  happened  but  theres  an  obvious

flux  during  school  start  and  end  times

that  I  think  could  easily  be  addressed

by  just  maybe  like  increasing  a  couple

buses  for  a  couple  hours  I  dont  know

how  that  works  but

it  would  be  a  create  a  fixture  I  guess

so  I  live  in  the  sunset  and  Ive  lived

in  the  mission  and  I  would  say  those  are

the  two  I  can  speak  on  the  most

um

I  really  love  the  mission

um  because  of  all  the  storefronts

underneath  so  you  can  within  like  a

couple  block  radius  you  can  really  just

like  live  its  very  walkable

um my  favorite  part  about  that  is  I

could  just  walk  to  Safeway  across  the

street

um there  is  a  fun  place  and  then  we  had

a  grocery  store  that  was  local  another

block  away

um  Mitchells  was  close  by  it  just  was  a

really  good  spot

um

the  Sun  the  weather  is  amazing  sometimes

uh  the  fog  can  beat  you  down  after  so

much  time

I  also  really  love

um

the  liviness  of  the  mission  and  just

more  access  to  Transportation

um you  can  hop  on  the  cable  cars  or  any

Muni  and  just  get  pretty  much  anywhere

over  there

um  one  of  the  negatives  of  the  mission

for  me  is  like  we  lived  on  a  super  busy

uh  unicorner  where  they  would

send  them  all  home  too  so  wed  have  like

the  carts  squeaking  up  until  like  five

in  the  morning  and  so  it  took  some

getting  used  to  but  the  loudness

definitely  would  be  a  downside  but

thats  really  the  only  downside

um

of  the  mission  I

I  really  love  sunset  too  though  we  live

in  a  really  good  spot  where  its  super

close  to  Golden  Gate  its  super  close  to

the  beach  so  it  has  a  lot  of  access  that

way  one  thing  I  do  miss  is  that  theres

a  little  less  access  to  restaurants

um  or  a  variety  in  restaurants

uh  we  could  pick  from  10  that  we  could

walk  to  in  here  so  we  have  to

plan  our  walk  a  little  bit  more  and  see

if  we  actually  want  to  walk  back  or  if

its  worth  the  10  minute  drive

um  so  we  dont  have  to  walk  uphill

but

um  its  a  lot  more  quiet  out  here  uh

people  really  care  about  the

neighborhood  theres

a  lot  of  community  even  though  its  not

like  nurses  saying  hi  to  your  neighbor

every  day  but  we  do  look  out  for  each

other

um

its  a  little  bit  cleaner  over  here  but

then  you  lose  the  access  to

transportation  and  a  little  more  variety

so

pros  and  cons  on  both  sides  the  The  Fog

can  get  me  over  here  but  thats  pretty

much  it  I  can  drive  easily  out  of  it  but

thats  thats  the  main  downside

I  know  that  there  are  free  days  at

museums  and  arts

um  I  would  like  to  see  more  of  that

happen

um  I  know  other  cities  uh

I  think  when  I  visited

um  St  Louis  recently  all  their  art

museums  are  free  so  anyone  can  go  in

anyone  can  access  those  I  wish  there  was

a  little  bit  more

access  to  arts  or  like  music

um  more  publicized  I  think  we  rely  on

the  internet  a  lot  but  also  Flyers  do  a

lot  too

um

but  even  if  residents  had  like  half

price  uh  for  museums  because  like  you

get  in  the  botanical  gardens  for  free  if

youre  a  resident  and  just  extending

that  to  arts  and  more  creative  Outlets

where  people  can  spend  their  time  more

conducively  and  thinking  and  doing  that

kind  of  stuff  I  think  would  be  really

amazing

and  when  thinking  about  uh  you  mentioned

that  students  could  wait  up  to  another

to  and  after  the  next  bus  to  kind  of

kind  of  go  down  is  there  any  community

services  that  you  would  think

for  Muni

yeah

yeah

um  well  thanks  to  phones

um  a  lot  of  parents  dont  worry  too  much

anyway  they  have  like  share  their

location  all  that  so  they  see  where

there  are

um

and  there  are  a  lot  of  after  school

programs  the  school  does  provide  but  a

lot  of  that  is  a  volunteer  work  by

teachers  or  like  clubs  or  Sports  theres

not  a  lot  of  opportunities  for  teachers

to

like  provide  their  space  for  students  or

provide  an  activity  where  it  is

compensated

um  but  you  know  teachers  care  about

their  kids  so  all  Im  always  in  there

late  anyways  so  Ill  host  whatever  kids

need  to  have  a  safe  place  to  be  but  um

I  dont  know  its  hard  because  usually  a

community  does  step  up  to  fill  those

roles  whether  its  um

compensated  or  not  so  I  think  that  that

does  exist  already

um  just  naturally  within  teachers  in

that  Community  but  I  do  know

that  I  dont  think  yeah  I  I  dont  know

if  I  have  an  answer  to  that  one

um  my  favorite  thing  about  San  Francisco

is  the  mom  and  pop  shops

um  people  in  the  city  being  able  to  own

restaurants  and  live  and  be  able  to  like

live  and  survive  off  of  that  I  know  we

saw  a  lot  of

local  restaurants  close  over  the

pandemic  because  it  just  wasnt  able  to

keep  up  with  it  and  I  dont  know  if

rents  are  going  to  raise  and  thats

going  to  also  contribute  to  that  issue

but

um  anytime  I  have  people  visit  like

thats  the  part  of  San  Francisco  I  show

them  I  show  them  that  you  can  walk  to

this  store  get  a  coffee  go  to  the  next

one  get  a  nice  fresh  pastry  or  go  down

the  road  and  get  a  Mediterranean  lunch

like  its  just  thats  the  beauty  of  the

city  is  being  able  to  have  that

Multicultural  aspect  walkability  and

being  able  to  like  access  everything

easily

um

yeah  thats  the  part  I  like  to  show

because  thats  the  best  part  the  city

has

I  I do  have  hopes  that  housing  just  will

become  more  accessible

um

I  dont  know  what  person  looks  at  a  1.5

million  dollar  I  was  like  I  got  that

thats  nothing  I  can  pay  for  that

um

so  I  would  I  would  like  to  see  like  just

housing  costs  go  down  and  just  be  more

mindful  of  the  actual  citizens  of  the

city  and  not  the  most  wealthy  that  make

it  here  and  can  afford  those  prices
