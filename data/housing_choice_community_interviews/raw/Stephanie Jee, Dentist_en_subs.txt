my  name  is  Stephanie  G

um  Im  a  native  San  Franciscan  and  Im  a

dentist  and  I  practice  out  in  the  sunset

and  Im  currently  living  in  Forest  Hill

from  what  I  can  remember  back  we  lived

on  Sacramento  Street  on  Hyde  in  a  flat

um

and  I  went  to  reading  school  at  that

time

but  in  night  in  1966

our  family  were  my  parents  were

expecting  the  third  uh  the  fourth  child

and  so

my  grandmother  gave  them

seven  thousand  down  for  the  down  payment

on  a  32  000  home  on  15th  and  Taraval  and

my  mom  just  passed  away  last  week  but

they  they  still  occupied  that  that  home

when  we  moved  there

out  to  the  sunset

um

then  I  started  going  to  West  Portal

school  when  we  lived  on  15th  Avenue  in

that  single-family  home  there  were  two

other  Asian

families  on  that  block  and  I  think  back

in  the  60s  there  was

more  a  sense  of  neighborhoods  and  and

well  playing  with  the  kids  who  are  on

your  block  and  so

we  all  the  Kids  on  the  Block  played  with

each  other  and  and  then

we  we  came  we  would

be  out  in  the  afternoon  and  then  we

would  go  home

either  at  five  oclock  or  when  the  sun

went  down  or  if  we  heard  that  our

parents  had  dinner  ready

so  when  I  went  to  West  Portal  school

there  were  only  10  Asian  kids  in  the

whole  community

in  in  the  whole  school  and  so  I  really

did  very  much  feel  like  a  minority

um

and  I  do  remember  that  my  my  dad  always

told  me  that

the  only  way  that  I  could  succeed  is  if

I  was  better  than  everyone  else  so  he

always  wanted  me  to  be  the  smartest  kid

so  that  was  like  the  goal  that

um  since  that  since  my  dad  was  an

immigrant

um  but  anyway

um

back  then

the  Asian  kids  really  kept  to  themselves

and  I  guess

um  I  missed  when  there  were  more  Asians

in  my  life

but  as  I  got  older  and  I  went  to

middle  school  and  high  school  there  were

more  people  who  were  like  me

and  even  when  I  went  to  college  and

dental  school  I  was  always  a  minority

either  because  I  was  a  woman  or  I  was

Asian

and  um

so

I  never  knew  that

the  reason  why  there  werent  so  many

Asians  out  in  the  sunset  in  the  park

side  was  that  um  there  was  a  law  that

Asian  people  couldnt

couldnt  live  there

but  anyway

um

I  ended  up

getting  to  practice  out  here  in  in  the

neighborhood  that  I  grew  up  pretty  much

and  even  at  that  time

um  because  I  purchased  the  practice  from

a  white  dentist

um  I  felt  like  there  was  going  to  be  a

problem  because  I  was  a  woman  and  an

Asian  person

that  dentist

took  a  liking  to  me  and  really  trusted

me  and  so

Im  really  grateful  because

I  realized  later  that  um  he

he  was  a  businessman  out  here  but  he

really  grew  up in  a  very  white  world  so

for  him  to  be  open-minded  about  a  woman

Dennis  taking  reverse  practice  I  thought

was  really  big  of  him

and  shortly  after  having  my  getting  my

practice  here  I  purchased  a  home  in

Forest  Hill

and  one  thing  that  was  really  unusual

about  um

purchasing  that  home  was

the  the  seller  was  actually  living  next

door  to  this  home  in  Forest  Hill  and  was

Chinese  and  so  actually  it  was  one  of

the  first  times  in  my  life  that  being

Asian  being  Chinese

worked  in  my  favor

because  he  found  out  that  I  was  Chinese

and  I  was  a  dentist  and  so

um

I  think  he  was  pretty  motivated  to  make

the  deal

its  kind  of  interesting

um  his  daughter  lives  next  door  now

and  theres  an  Asian  family  that

actually  is  moving  in  across  the  street

and  uh

and  then  there  was  a  home  also  across

the  street  for  sale  and  my  neighbor  she

told  me  she  was  hoping  an  Asian  person

would  buy  it  but  you  know  its  its

changed  so  much

because  also  forests  still  in  their

bylaws  also  had  a  section  where  they  did

not  allow  Asian  people  to  buy  and  I  even

understand  that  I  think  Willie  Mays

because  he  had  a  home  in  Forest  Hill  and

it  wasnt  easy  for  him  to

get  that  house  in  Forest  Hill

but  Im  glad  somehow

it  happened  for  him

I  think

um

probably  at  that  time  there  were  more

there  were  neighborhood  schools  so  it

was  likely  that  whoever  was  on  your

block  went  to  school  with  you

um  I  think  housing  in  general  was  maybe

more  affordable  there  were  more  families

the  other  thing  that  has  happened  over

the  years  in  the  city  is  that

way  back  then  I  would  say  there  werent

too  many  working  mothers  so  there  were  a

lot  of  stay-at-home  moms  and  that

allowed

kids  to  not  be  an  after-school  care  they

were  went  home

and  so  playing  with  the  Kids  on  the

Block  was  something  that  everybody  did

because  all  the  moms  really

kind  of  established  that  community

and  its  interesting  when  I  think  back

because

there  wasnt  so  much  crime  and  so  I  do

remember  like  we  left  windows  open  and

sometimes  our  doors  unlocked  and

um

way  back  then  because  you  know  I  live  in

Forest  Hill  now  and

um  when  I  moved  there

I  did  the  same  thing  its  not  that  I

left  my  doors  unlocked  but  I  left  my

windows  open  and  so  weve  been

burglarized  like  twice  and  weve  lived

there  23  years  so  and  now  we  have  an

alarm  system  and

um  Im  learning  that

um  its  a  its  a  very

well-to-do  neighborhood  but  there  is

crime  and  I  would  say  every  homeowner

has  an  alarm  but  I  think  as  I  said

getting  back  to  why  theres  not  that

sense  of  community  is  that

you  know  I  think  more  it  has  to  do  with

that  there  are  a  lot  of  working  parents

and  what  kids  do  after  school  is  totally

different  for  instance  Im  a  working

parent  and  when  my  daughter  was  growing

up  I  was  constantly  looking  for  after

after  school  care  and  summer  camps  I  was

not  home  to  entertain  kids

actually  we  moved  in  June  of  1966  and

the  one  thing  was  back  then

um  in  the  Nob  Hill  area  its  sunny  and

so  when  we  moved  out  here

foggy  every  day  and  I  remember  after  the

first

after  the  first  week

my  mom  was  walking  us  home  from  school

and  I  asked  her  if  is  it  going  to  be  is

it  going  to  be  foggy  like  this  every  day

and  and  it  was  and  I  even  have  a  picture

in  my  when  my  operatories  of

San  Francisco  in  fog  because  it  reminds

me  of  that  day  that  I  asked  her  about

that  the  other  thing  is  that  um  we  when

we  lived  in  in  Nob  Hill  area

we  live  near  the  Polk  Street  area  which

is  really  you  know  its  really  dense

down  there  and  it  was  really  happening

kind  of  a  really  neat  place  to  shop  and

and  walk  to

when  we  came  out  here  on  Taraval  you

know  there  was  a  whole  bunch  of  car

dealerships  and

um

also  I  think

all  of  a  sudden  we  were  in  a

neighborhood  that  was  not  as  Asian  so  I

think

um  it  was  just  strange  to  us

well  what  I

um  I  grew  up  in  a  really  close-knit

family  my  my  mother  was  the  youngest  of

like  13.  and  when  we  were  growing  up  we

all

um

had  a  Sunday  dinner  at  my  grandmothers

house  and  she  lived  on  Broadway  just

just  up  from  Chinatown

everybody  lived  in  the  city  at  that  time

and  all  my  cousins  I  think  there  are  25

of  them  stayed  in  the  Bay  Area  but  now

those  my  cousins  kids  mostly  are  not

even  cant  even  afford  to  live  in  San

Francisco

so  theyre  all  spread  out  I  think  the

other  thing  even

from  a  college  perspective

um

a  lot  of  my  cousins  and  I

we  attended  local  universities

mostly  either  City  or  SF  state  or

Berkeley  and  so  well  the  admissions  I

mean  its  very  difficult  to  get  admitted

to  Berkeley  now

so  actually  no  no  none  of  the  kids

really  go  to  even

University  nearby

so  were  just  all  really  really  spread

out

I  think  the  other  thing  that  Im  seeing

just  in  my  patient  pool  is  when  I  first

started  practicing  here  in  um  19  1996.

the  patients  I  had  were  like  um

a  lot  of  people  in  a  lot  of  teachers  a

lot  of  people  who  work  for  PG  e  firemen

policemen

uni  drivers

and  I  think  there  were  there  was  this

ability  for  blue  collar  workers  to

afford  homes  out  here  so  theyre  almost

everybody  was  a  homeowner  out  here

even  you  know  the  school  teachers  I  have

a  number  of  school  teacher  families  that

on  a  two  on  a  two  school  teacher  salary

some  of  these  families  own  two  homes

was  it  unusual  but  now  you  know  the

teachers

um

come  from  far  away

and  so  the  next  generation  is  not  able

to  live  here  unless  they  real  they

really  would  want  to  live  here

and  some  do  actually  scrape  by  and  get

very  creative  about  financing  to  stay

here  but  its  not  easy

I  would  say  that  actually

because  I  had  that

that  base  of  the  blue  collared  workers

who  were  homeowners  who  also  had  really

good  dental  insurance  but  dental

benefits  that

they  were  able  to  do  the  work  now  its

its  harder

um

its  harder  but  I  would  say

there  is  still  a  lot  of  wealth  in  San

Francisco  so  there  are  still  a  lot  of

patients  who  can  afford  the  work

um  and  certainly  fees  are  always  in  my

discussion  when  I  talk  with  patients  I

would  say  that  another  factor  which  is

probably  unrelated  to  this  whole  story

is  that  the  insurance  reimbursement  is  a

lot  less  compared  to  what  my  fees  are

now  and  so  the  patients  have  to  make  up

that  difference  I  think  also  the  cost  of

my  running  my  business  meaning  the

salaries  that  I  have  to  pay

impacts  what  my  fees  are  and  it  impacts

the  fee  structure  of  anybody  running

running  a  business  in  San  Francisco  is

salaries

I  do  think  that  for  in  certain  sectors

such  as  the  teaching  and  the

teaching  the  fire  department  the  police

department

for  City  Services  that  they  should  have

housing

so  so  that  the  bird  so  that  theres  not

so  so  much  of  a  burden  for  for  people  to

live  so  far  away  because  I  think

um

when  you  have

um

when  you  have  this  this

Incredible  cost  to  live  here  then  youre

not  able  to  attract  good  talent

because

I  think  for  instance

um  you  know  UCSF  is  a  really

well-renowned  medical  facility  research

really

um

Cutting  Edge

very  difficult  to  attract  a  good

post-docs  because  because  you  know

initially  theyre  not  actually  getting

paid  that  much  but  also  they  they  have

to  find  housing  at  that  point  you  know

they  might  be  in  their

um

late  20s  early  30s  theyre  starting

families  and

they  might  be  having  kids  not  not  easy

for  them  and

um

if  you  want  them  to  stay  you  know

theres  got  to  be  some  incentive

so  I  I  think  that  would  really  help  a

lot

um

I  think  also  actually  which  this  is

probably

you  know  I  think

Im  seeing  a  lot  of

um  homeowners  that  their  kids  are

inheriting  the  house  their  housing

thats  its  one  way  of  making  it

affordable  for  the  Next  Generation  to

sit  to  stay  Im  not  saying  thats  next

necessarily  fair  to  help  the  people  who

want  to  stay  here  or  stay  here  but  you

know  if  they  there  was  some  incentives

but  but  but  definitely  I  think  that  they

lose  really

good  teachers  because  you  know

you  know  because  theres  theres  other

places  to  live

one  thing  I  would  say  about  San

Francisco  is  because  Im  still  here  and

I  I  want  to

I  want  to  stay  here  and  you  know  my

daughter  actually  were  going  to  close

on  a  condo  and  um

were  helping  her  buy  it

mostly  because  shes  expressed  interest

in  staying  but  also  because  Ive  seen

um  people  move  out  of  the  city  to  follow

their  kids  wherever  they  are

because  this  is  uh

becomes  a  necessity  I  think  when  you  get

to  an  advanced  age  as  you  want  to  be

close  to  your  family

so  to  lock  in  that  my  daughter  could  be

close  to  me  and  that  I  dont  have  to

chase  her  around  the  country  or  the

world

I  helped  her

I  think  though  that

you  have  you  have  a  lot  of  workers  who

are  commuting  really  long  distances

and  its  such  a  its  still  a  desirable

place  to  to  be  but  I  think  that  the

service  workers  can  only

exist  if  if  they  can  have  housing

well  I  think

I  think  actually

if  they

if  they  help  the  policemen  and  firemen

that  they  would  think  they  would  get

Workers

I  think  also  even  the  muni  drivers

because  you  know  take  public

transportation

although

um  I  think

eventually  eventually  the  workers  find

their  themselves  there

and  and  the  teachers  that  that  Im

seeing  in  the  schools  that  theyre

always  short  teachers

it  seems  to  me  like  everything  on  the

west  side  is  pretty  good  you  know  I

think

you  know  I

because  Ive  thought  about  this

that  I  always  think  that  in  the  Richmond

near  Clement  is  would  be  prob  probably

one  of  the  nicest  place  to  places  to

live  because  its  pretty  flat

and  the  weathers  pretty  good

so  a  person  who  didnt  have  a  car

could  have  access  to  just  so  much

that  that kind  of  stands  out  to  me

because  its  not  its  not  hilly

and  you  know  theres  some  good  bus  lines

like  the  California  bus  the  Geary  is

really

taking  you

you  know  downtown  youve  got  Sun  so  I

would  say  I  would  say  about  that  you

know  the  Richmond

probably  have

the  best

well  you  know  whats  interesting  is  Ive

heard  because

um  you  know  I  I  was  looking  at  condos

that  had  an  elevator  and

I  guess  because  my  parents  you  know

who  just  passed  on  there  were  two  there

were  two  issues  about  them  staying  in

their  house  one  was  that  their  their

bathroom  was  totally  not  accessible  and

there  were  these  stairs

so  for  my  daughter  I  chose  a  condo  that

that  has  an  elevator  and  actually  Im

going  to  convert  one  of  the  bathrooms

into  a  walk-in  shower  now  I  think  if  you

had  those  kind  of

condo

condos  that  were  like  around  you  know

you  know  and  then  its  this  is  a  condo

thats

you  know  the  banks  theres  two  two  Banks

uh  or  three  Banks  within  a  within  a

three  block  radius  shes  got

three  Banks  shes  got  a  safe  way  shes

got  two  really  good  Chinese  stores  a

Chinese  Bakery  Walgreens  and

um

a  pizza  place  and  the  library  oh  and

three  blocks  away  from  a  public  swimming

pool

if  you  have  that  kind  of  thing  another

kind  of  community  that  I  was  looking  I

was  looking  at  that  I  think  theres

condos  near  H  Mart  which  I  thought  was

theres  bank  theres  a  big  H  Mart  if  you

have  those  kind  of  communities  or  like

um  I  think  out  in  South  City  where

theyve  got  condos  and  then  theyve  got

like  this  big

Civic  super  and  then  thinking  about  that

Ive  been  thinking  about  you  know

accessibility  not  just  for  you  know

wheelchair  access  but  for  for  the  Aging

Community  its  really  uh  really

something  important  I  would  say  you  know

um  having  had  like  the  last  seven  or

eight  years  being  a  Hands-On  caregiver

um because  I  knit  recently  remodeled  one

of  my  bathrooms  to  be  a  walk-in  shower

so  I  like  to  think  like  I  could  stay  a

little  bit  longer  because

when  you  get  to  that  point  where  youre

you  know  in  your  you  cant  walk  the

stairs  or  anymore  youre  in  denial  that

you  even  need  help

you  know  you  you  certainly  wouldnt

you  wouldnt  even  like  think  about

putting  grab  bars  in  your  bathtub

so

you  know  yeah  you  could  be  proactive  but

when  I  talk  to  my  friends  about  whether

theyre  proactive  about  it  theyre  not

until  they  kind  of  can  see  that  you  know

access  is  really  important

I  think

um  you  know

we  we  did  a  lot  of  the  park  and  Iraq

programs  and  like

its  kind  of  funny  like  I  was  giving  my

receptionist  some  advice  about  like

logging  in  in  March  on  the  Saturday  to

get  the  programs  that  Im  like  okay  make

sure  make  sure  you

um  have  an  account  ready  and  youve  got

a  couple  of  computers  and  even  if  you

try  and  log  in

for  15  minutes  dont  give  up  and  like

its  such  craziness  like

maybe  if  they  could  expand  on  it  to  make

it  so  that  like  people  can  get  those

really  inexpensive  programs  I  think  the

other  thing  is  like  um  I  guess

um  there  is  like

theres  BMR  housing  or  and  actually

um I  heard  that  its  a  really

hard  Lottery  system  like

how  can  you  like  make  it  so  like  a

lottery  but  you  know  what  I  have  two

patients  that  actually  won  the  lottery

so  Im  happy  for  them  then  I  you  know  I

just  think  wow  theyre  theyre  just  so

lucky

but  um  maybe  if  they  were  able  to  kind

of  expand  on  that  that  idea

that  thats

I  think

something  that

those  two  things

um

I  guess

small  businesses

and  the  sense  of  community  or  like

seeing  seeing  the  same  people  every  day

you  know

you  know  but  but  its  the  small

businesses  I  mean

you  know  I

I  grew  up  in  such  a  white  world  that  I

dont  speak  Chinese  well  but  at  one  of

the  Chinese  markets

the  owners  he  makes  me  speak  Chinese

every  time  I  go  in  hes  kind  of  teaching

me  Chinese  and  so

I  dont  know  thats  very  special

and  so  I  think  its  the  small  businesses

where  you  have  that  sense  of  community

I  think  thats  also  actually  why

I  find  San  Franciscos

so  much  more  interesting  than  you  know

you  could  I  guess  you  could  live

anywhere  in  anywhere  in  USA  but  what

makes  San  Francisco  so  interesting  is

the neighborhoods

I  think  one  comment  I  would  make  like

um

I  think  trying  to  make

um

housing  more  affordable  by  putting  up

some  really  outrageous  high-rise

Condominiums  is  kind  of

like

strange  that  projects  like  that  even  get

considered  like  because  I  think  that  um

if  you  are  able  to  um

allow  new  housing  thats  kind  of  like

with  kind  of  contiguous  with  whats

already  there  its  really

be  better  than

letting  some  develop  or  put  up  a  big

high  rise  because  I  think  the  residents

wouldnt  like  it

I  think  I  dont  know  I  mean  I  dont  know

how  easy  it  is  to  subdivide  or  condoise

apartments  maybe  you  know  and  I  know

that  there  are  tics  too  but  and  I  dont

understand  that  the  housing  laws  very

well  but  allowing  allowing

things  allowing  properties  to  be

somewhat  subdivided

is

um

is  something  that  you  know

could  make  it  easier

for  there  to  be  housing  within  the

housing  thats  already  here

seeing  the  city  kind  of  go  through  its

ups  and  downs  and  I  think  that  right  now

is  a  real  down  time

um

I  I  guess  there  seems  to  be  a  lack  of

law  law  there  seems  to  be  a  lawlessness

here  that  needs  to  be  under  control  and

if  people  dont  feel  like  theyre  very

its  very  safe  then

um

its  not  a  good  thing  I  think  um

also

um

that

um

I  think  actually  at  the  top

um  this  the  the  mayor  has  to  be  more  of

a  deal  maker  as  far  as  like  bringing  in

new  business

you  know  because

um you  know  there  was  a  time  when  Tech

wanted  to  be  here  and  Im  sure  theres  a

way  to  attract

maybe  a  different  sector  here

but  you  know  I  think  you  have  to  be  a

bit  of  a  deal  maker  to  you  know

you  know  for  that  to  happen

um I  think  also  anyway  there  are  always

these  ups  and  downs  and  that

um  even  though  this  is  a  down  time  I

think  there  will  always  be  you  know

opportunistic  business  types  that  are

that  are  still  thinking  of

of  being  in  San  Francisco  and  I  think  um

our  our  very  favorable  climate  has  a  lot

to  do  with  that
