my  name  is  Xiao  Ming  Chong  but  people

call  me  by  Ming  is  easier  and  originally

Im  from  Indonesia  and  I  moved  here  when

I  was  27  years  old  so  Ive  been  living

here  for  27  years  now  and  I  called  San

Francisco  home

for  now

and  so  youve  lived  in  San  Francisco  the

whole  27  years  actually  I  spent  my  first

year  my  very  first  year  in  Nashville

Tennessee

thats  the  place  that  I  took  my  English

class  in  Nashville  Tennessee  and  I  have

a  good  friend  who  lives  in  Nashville

so  and  after  that  I  moved  to  San

Francisco

okay  so  the  housing  story  housing  story

is  um

first  when  I  moved  from  Nashville

to  San  Francisco  I  was  shocked

the  price  everything  was  so  expensive

compared  to  Nashville  back  in  1995

so  I  used  to  live

in

two

bedrooms  apartment  in  Nashville

and  I  paid  maybe  four  hundred  dollars

for  that  and  I  shared  a  small  swimming

pool  with  another  a  few  units  but  when  I

moved  to  San  Francisco  it  was  shock

the  price  was  completely  different  but

anyway

so  I  used  to  live  on  Judah  and  29th

and  I  still  remember  it  was  a

two  bedroom  one  bath  900  square  feet

and  it  was  only  the  two  of  us

my  myself  and  my  fiance

but  right  after  my

before  my  son  was  born  actually  my

brother-in-law  came

and  and  they  lived  with  us

so  and  when  my  son  was  born  it  was  five

of  us  with  the

900  square  feet  it  was  definitely  too

small

so  even  though  we  were  not  ready  in  19

2000

2004  2005.

even  though  I  was  we  were  not  ready  to

buy  any  house  but  we  have  to  we  were

forced  to  buy  a  house  in  2005  because  uh

five  of  us  living  in  900  square  feet

with  two  bedroom  is  almost  like  there  is

no  space  for  everyone

thats  the  reason  why  we  have  to  buy  the

house  in  2005.  but  looking  back  to  that

time

even  though  we  were  not  ready

now  we  are  grateful  with  the  housing

situation  right  now

so  um

we  still  remember  I  still  remember  in

2005.

we  paid  only  five  percent  on  payment  for

the  house  even  that  time  because  of  our

credit  score  was  good  I  would  I  would

say  excellent  we  were

uh

actually  we  were  eligible  to  pay  seared

on  payment  that  time

so  if  I  didnt  take  the  zero  down

payment  we  paid  five  percent

so  and  it  turns  out  in  2008

there  was  a  housing  collapse

because  I  think  the  bank  was  a  little

bit  too  aggressive

so  yeah

so  a  long  story  short  we  owned  the  house

in  43rd  Avenue  right  now  for  the  last  17

years  and  we  are  really  grateful  for

that

thats  another  thing  we  bought  the  house

in  2005  and  I  started  my  first  business

restaurant  business  in  2006  one  year

later  with  a  mortgage  payment  with  a  new

business  everything  was  so

so  difficult

so  I  owned  the  business  since  2000  2006.

and

that  was  my  first

restaurant

the  second  one  I  opened  up  in  2014.

so  now  I  have  two  restaurants

and  um

so  far  so  good  and  pandemic  conflict  was

really  big  impact  to  my  business  but  now

everything  is  almost  back  to  normal  but

still  not  100  yet

uh  it  changed  a  lot  actually  I  mean  in

2000

around  2000  the  year  2000

we  were  thinking  to  buy  a  house  the

house  was  like  a  400  500  000  two  bedroom

in  the  sunset  area

but  we  couldnt  afford  everything  the

down  payment  and  things  like  that

so  finally  we  we  were  forced  to  buy  a

house  in  2005  and  we  kind  of  uh

uh  Gamble  a  little  bit  because  uh  there

was  a  good  program  0.  payment  and  we

ended  up  on  the  giving  putting  a  five

percent  down  payment

so

from  that  time  to  todays  money

I  think  the  property  worth  double

so  we  bought  it  around  775.

1000  now  its  becoming  around  1.5  1.6

so

even  during  the

the  housing

Crest  in  2008

the  price  for  San  Francisco  house  did  a

little  bit  like  a  15-20  percent  for  a

few  months  only  compared  to  other  cities

in  Bay  Area  and  after  that  I  just  went

back  up  like  crazy  I  think  the  highest

housing  prices  was  in  uh  during  coffee

actually

so  2021  2020

no  2020  the  end  of  2020  and  the  whole

year  2021  was  the  peak

now  its  a  little  bit  slowing  down  a

little bit  the  price  but  um  still  still

high  for  most  of  the  people  who  wants  to

live  in  San  Francisco

and  Ive  been  doing  a  real  estate

almost  four  years  now

and  the  timing  was  good  because  during

coffee  actually  so  many  families

whether  they  are  ready  or  not  some  of

them  they  have  to  buy  a  house  because  of

the  other  place  that  they  live  in  is

just  too  small

yeah  I  think

there  is  a  big  relationship  between

uh  the  the  affordable  housing  price  with

the  business  because

its  my  clients  uh

when  the  price  of  the  housing  wasnt

that  high  even  before  before  coffee

I  think  theres  uh  theyre  a  little  bit

more  generous  in  spending  so  they  are

not  that  much  of  a

price  sensitive

but  now

I  think  its  a  little  bit  price

sensitive

especially  during  coffee  too  yeah  so

I  its  just  in  in  my  opinion  its  just

so  many

families  that  they  cannot  afford  to  buy

a  house  in  San  Francisco  because  the

price  of  the  house  in  San  Francisco  is

just  its  not  affordable

and  um  and  thats  impact  the  business

because  uh

these  families  wants  to  save  some  money

for  maybe  buying  a  house  down  the  road

but

but  on  the  other  hand  they  are  cutting

their  expenses  in  eating  out  and  things

like  that

no  its  completely  different  Im  telling

actually  the

the  different  I  can  feel  the  difference

when  uh  right  before  coffee

so  I  think

around  March  before  they  do  the

um  just  stay  at  home  policy  the

beginning  of  coffee

was  kind  of  a  bustling  and  there  are  so

many  people  on  the  street  and

um

its  so  hard  to  find  parking  space

I  mean  its  almost  impossible  on  Clement

Street

and  thats  happening  those  things  happen

before  coffee

do  you  recovered  thats  another  story

and  now  after  coffee

a  few  months  or  maybe  a  year  after

coffee  actually  this  the  street

the  Richmond  area  still  not  back  to

normal  yet  because  I  can  tell  around  9  8

30  9  pm

the  road  is  already  kind  of  quiet  right

now

so  yeah

no  definitely  definitely  I  will  choose

to  build  more  housing  in  San  Francisco

if  its  possible  because  like  you  said

this  is  a  complex  issue  its  not  only

keep  building  the  house  but  whos  going

to  find  this  money  so  yeah

building  more  housing  in  San  Francisco

will  be  the  best  solution  in  my  opinion

because  all  the  middle  income  family  or

the  middle  class  family  they  can  afford

to  live  in  the  city

because  otherwise  it  will  drive  them  out

from  the  city  and  then

and  whos  going  to  live  in  the  city

because  all  small  businesses  like  mine

really  depends  on  our  class  of  family

so

yeah  I  think  definitely  building  more

houses  is  one  of  the  the  best  solution

but  the  other  great  question  is  is  it

possible  to  build  the  house  in  San

Francisco

because

not  much  of  land

and  even  if  there  is  land  is  going  to

cost  so  much  money

so  I  think  I  I  just  leave  this  this  uh

this  issue  to  the  city  leaders  to  figure

out

I  think

yeah  housing  is  always  always  a  big

issue  and  very  interesting  issue  because

um

if  you  dont  have  enough  middle  class

family  you  live  in  the  city

so  whos  going  to  work  in  the  city

I  mean  Im  considering  myself  a  middle

class  family  and  I  I  was  lucky  enough  to

buy  my  house  long  time  ago  but  they  have

to  buy  the  house  today

Im  not  sure

I  think

spread  them  out  its  okay  and  it  doesnt

have  to  be  in  one  particular  area

because  uh  because  otherwise  its  not

going  to  be  fair

for  everyone

because  they  might  think  that  how  come  I

dont  live  in  the  area  instead  of  living

in  the  other  area  which  is  is  not  really

um

uh  desirable

so  I  think  just  build  it  everywhere  its

just

trying  to

to  work  maybe  with  the  the  police

department

or  with  the  law  enforcement  make  sure

that  all  area  is  going  to  be  safe

I  mean  if  one  area  is  not  safe  so  even

if  you  have  like  an  affordable  house  in

this  area  who  wants  to  live  there

I  mean  its  the  safety  issue  now

so

yeah  just  build  a  house  housing

everywhere  and  make  sure  its  safe  for

everyone  to  live  in  the  house  I  think

I  think  we  want  him  to  live  nearby  San

Francisco  the  best  way  if  you  live  in

San  Francisco  in  his  own  house  so  he

doesnt  need  to  live  with  us  but  um

I  think  yeah  we  we  would  like  him  to

live  not  too  far  from  where  we  live  so

um even  L.A  right  now  he  live  in  L.A  so

its  a  little  bit  too  far

so  I  I  ideally  I  want  him  to  live  near

here  like  a  Bay  Area  still  okay  maybe

two  hours  drive  still  fine  but  uh

speaking  of  affordable

for  for  him  well

I  think

maybe  this  is  just  me  or  my  family

we  will  do  our  best  to  support  and  help

him

to  do  it  to  purchase  his  first  house

regardless  of  where  it  is  because  in  the

past  we  have  to  work  so  hard  to  purchase

our  own  house  we  know  how  hard  it  is  to

buy  a  house  but  in  my  opinion

owning  a  house  is  a  big  and  the  best

investment  in

everyones  life  I  think

so  as  a  parent  we  will  definitely  help

him  to  do  that

I  think  thats  a  very  very  difficult  you

know  I  would  say  its  almost  impossible

because

owning  a  business  in  San  Francisco  is

one  thing  but  only  your  house  nearby

your  business

I  think  thats  a  thats  everyones  dream

yeah  so  I  think  theres  two  different

things  because  uh

owning  your  house  thats  one  thing

thats  very  difficult  its  like  lets

just  put  it  this  way  its  an  American

Dream  to  have  your  own  house  in  big  city

like  San  Francisco  so

odinga  house  thats  very  hard  and  its

even  harder  owning  a  business  and  also

on  your

uh

uh  house  and  business  nearby  thats

almost  impossible

so

um  unless  if  youre  coming  from  like  a

rich  family  or  upper  class  family  with

tons  of  money  uh  picking  you  up

but  um

from  middle  class  family

whos  been  working  maybe  20  30  years  and

then  keeps  saving  their  money  and  trying

to  run  a  business  as  one  thing

because  after  you  own  a  house  in  San

Francisco  that  means  you  wont  have  any

money  left  basically  and  how  would  you

run  a  business

so  lets  uh  thats  the  reality  but  if

youre  running  your  business  first

and  even  if  you  keep  saving  money  from

your  business

it  will  takes  you  15  20  years  before  you

can  afford  to  buy  a  house  in  San

Francisco

uh  I  would  say  more  like  the  wealthier

family  who  already  have  surface  uh  set

aside  some  money

on  on  the  side  so  theyre  the  one  who

can  open  the  business  even  though  I  see

the  business  come  and  go  like  uh  they

open  for  one  two  years  and  then  close

down  and  and  yeah  it  hurts  this  family

but  its  not  wiping  out  the  whole

uh  saving  that  they  have  but  still

I  think

uh  if  I  can

mention  one  thing  that  uh  need  to  be

changed  for  people

to  uh

to  start  a  business  or  have  an  idea  to

open  a  business  in  San  Francisco  I  think

the  city  or  the  city  leaders  need  to

make  sure  that  the  safe  of  the

neighborhood  the  community  the  safety  I

think  thats  the  number  one  issue

because  even  right  now  when  I  close  the

restaurant  I  dont  feel  good  about  it

knowing  that  someone  might  rob  me  and

for  small  money  and  yeah  I  think

uh

before  trying  to  put  everything  else  I

think  they  need  to

to  take  out  the  safety  issue  first

because  if  you  dont  feel  safe  even  to

live  in  the  city

why  would  you  run  a  business  in  the  city

so  I  think  uh  taking  care  of  the  the

safety  issue  first  make  sure  that  people

feel  safe  and  good  running  the  business

because  otherwise  no  one  wants  to  run  a

business  in  San  Francisco

and

as  you  see  theres  a  lot  of  people

moving  out  from  San  Francisco  and  those

people  is  not  the  business  minded  person

its  just  a  regular  person  and  every  you

got  so  many  people  moving  out  from  the

city  because  of  the  safety  reason

so  what  was  the  use  of  uh  put  building

all  this  housing

I  dont  see  any  use  of  that

definitely  parking  spot  100  thats

number  one  things  that  I  know  you  dont

make  money  from  making  more  parking  spot

in  like  a  big  building  but  you  have  to

because

um

because

I  I  know  a  few  families  who  live  in  San

Francisco  they  dont  want  to  go  to

restaurant  near  Clement  or  even  his  Bali

area  because  they  already  turn  off

because  of  the  parking  spot

and  um  yeah  definitely  and  and  if  you

built  a  new  housing  in  like  a  very  dense

community  and  you  dont  provide  parking

space  you  will  make  everyone  get  so

angry  I  mean  they  they  will  be

frustrated  100  so  parking  space  please

do  plant  parking  space  I  know  this

family  is  prefer  to  go  down  south  to

Millbrae  to  Birmingham  to  have  their

meal  or  lunch  or  dinner  instead  of  going

to  the  city

just  because  of  the  parking  spot

yeah  so  definitely

so  if  you  I  mean  its  possible  its

doable  you  can  just  dig  another  story

down  two  or  three  levels  down  but  I  know

it  costs  more  money  but  definitely

parking  space  thats  it

I  think  that  a  young  person  who  just

graduated  from  college  I  think  thats

they  they  have  no  clue  or  maybe  they

they  have  a  lot  of  problems

to  generate  money  to  buy  a  house  in  San

Francisco

so

yeah  after  they  graduate  from  college

they  dont  know  how  much  how  expensive

is  the  housing  in  San  Francisco

so  when  the  reality  kicks  in  they  know

wow  I  need  to  work  another  35  years

straight  and  then  we  and  yeah  and

all  my  income  has  to  be  putting  in  the

safe  in  order  for  me  to  afford  the  house

in  San  Francisco  its  just  its  just

crazy  so  definitely  the  uh  the  city  or

maybe  the  state

need  to  uh  to  help

the  uh

uh  the  prospective

home  owners

to  have  their  house  first  without  with  a

lot  of  programs  I  know  the  city  has  the

BMR  like  a  down  payment  assistance  but

unfortunately

uh  they  dont  have  enough  of  these

programs  thats  always  the  problem

I  dont  know

where  the  fun  goes  but  um  in  my  in  my

opinion

its  uh  its  always  good  to  have  all

this  program  to  grow  first

because  thats  the  only  way  you  can  have

people  to  live  in  the  city  because  if

you  cannot  afford  to  live  in  the  city  so

youre  becoming  a  homeless  then

the  San  Francisco  in  general  I  love

the  city  so  much

this  is  like  I  said  at  the  beginning

this  is  my  home  now  its  um

that  the  landscape  is  not  boring  so

there  is  a  hill  ocean  and  park  so

yeah  everything  about  San  Francisco  is

really  really  good  and  especially  the

weather  in  San  Francisco  its

unbelievable

I  mean  you  can  all  you  can  just  have

like  a  two  set  of  clothing

and  summer  and

and  winter

and  thats  it  you  dont  need  to  prepare

anything  else  because  the  weather  is

just  perfect

and

the  the  neighborhood  that  I  live  we  like

it  because  its  close  enough  to  the

ocean  and  I  like  something  cold  rather

than

um  hot  and  humid  Im  from  Indonesia  and

the  weather  is  like  a  90  95  degrees  and

humid

so  I  dont  miss  that  so  San  Francisco  is

really  nice  and  the  neighborhood  that  I

live  in  is  uh  the  people  are  still  nice

and  still  there  is  a  lot  of  trees  near

the  lake

so  yeah  Im  grateful  from  the  place  that

I  have  right  now

and  I  hope

the  city  leaders

can  do  something

to  make  San  Francisco  better

because

the  last  five  years  I  would  say  right

beginning  coffee  maybe  the  last  four

years

San  Francisco  unfortunately  San

Francisco  is  going  downhill  but  the

crime

and  with  all  the  the  homeless  issues  the

housing  issues

so  yeah  I  just  leave  it  to  the

simulators  to  work  on  that

the  pericard

the  Pedic  line  please  dont  take  very

crime

easily

because

the  the  bank  robbers  and  all  this  big

crime  is  coming  from  the  petty  crime

because  if  you  let  it  slide  all  the  time

and  then  its  becoming  like  their

practice  ground

before  theyre  becoming  a  real  threat  a

real  problem  so  lets  handle  all  this

thing  from  the  beginning  if  before  it

gets  out  of  hand

I  think  thats  it
