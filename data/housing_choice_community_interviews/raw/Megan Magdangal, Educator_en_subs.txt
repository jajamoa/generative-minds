my  name  is  Megan  I  am  a  teacher  of  six

years

I  worked  in  South  San  Francisco  for  one

year  and  I  spent  the  last  five  years

teaching  in  San  Francisco

and  that  was  the  last  thing

and  just  your  connection  to  San

Francisco

um  Im  from  the  Bay  Area

um  I  grew  up  in  South  San  Francisco  my

mom  still  lives  there  and  I  went  to

college  in  SF  state  so  I  stayed  pretty

local

okay  so  I  guess  long  ago  my  um  my

grandparents

their  parents  owned  homes  in  the  city

um  over  time  they  kind  of

like  us  left  the  city  a  little  bit  but

um  my  my  dad  my  moms  family

um  they  live  kind  of  like  by  San  Bruno

Avenue  that  area

um

and  then  they  landed  up  leaving  because

the  schools  werent  so  good  my  mom  was

getting  picked  on  from  her  siblings  they

went  to  Catholic  school  out  here  and

then  they  landed  up  moving  to  San  Bruno

so  thats  my  grandma

um  my  dads  side  stayed  out  here  till

they  died  pretty  much  and  I  still  have

some  Uncle  my  uncle  lives  out  here  my

dads  brother

um  he  still  lives  in  the  City  by

by  Adam  City  College

and  then  um my  mom  when  she  went  through

her  first  marriage  she  was  able  to  get  a

home  in  South  San  Francisco  and  back

then  like  you  know  my  grandparents

really  helped  they  gave  her  a  document

on  a  house  so  she  was  able  to  maintain

that  and  then  I  grew  up  there  like  I

mentioned  I  went  to  schools  all  all  in

South  City  and  uh  I  moved  away  for  a

little  while  and  then  I  realized  gosh  I

gotta  go  to  college  and  get  a  job  so  I

uh  I  moved  back  home  it  was  the  only  way

I  could  afford  to  go  to  college  and

um

and  you  know  live  in  this  area  I  didnt

really  realize  it  was  so  expensive  until

I  was  finished  with  college  and  um

I  I got  I  finished  my  credential  program

and  I  was  like  super  excited  to  leave  my

moms  house  and  so  I  started  looking  for

places  and  I  started  realizing  like  I

cant  afford  anything  unless  I  share  a

house  with  a  bunch  of  people  so  I

started  looking  and  I  had  like  this

price  range  in  my  head  I  was  like  I  want

to  spend  a  thousand  dollars  which  wasnt

um  that

not  that  big  of  a  price  range  to  uh  for

this  area  so  I  uh  I  found  a  really  tiny

room  for  900  something

um  and

uh  it  was  in  Bayview  it  was  it  was  in  a

really  bad  area  my  mom  was  really  mad  at

me  because  she  was  thinking  like  thats

so  unsafe

um  and  thats  when  I  lived  there  and

then  um

I  started  the  the  house  the  living

situation  was  really  crazy  this  the

woman  who  was  in  charge  of  the  house  she

was  uh  she  was  just  letting  all  these

people  live  there  so  I  um  I  decided  to

leave  there  because  it  was  just  not

making  sense  people  were  eating  my  food

and  it  was  just  drama  and  um  and  then  I

kept  looking  in  the  city  I  I  gave  this

girl  my  30-day  notice  and  I  thought  I

found  a  place  in  the  mission  and  then

right  when  I  was  about  to  move  in  she

told  me  like

um  my  cousin  needs  to  move  in  blah  blah

blah  and  then  I  got

I  got  in  this  really  bad  situation  and  I

had  to  find  a  house  right  away  after

that  because  I  already  told  the  place  I

lived  in  that

um  you  know  Im  leaving  and  I  didnt

want  to  go  back  on  that  so  I  was  either

going  to  go  with  my  mom  or  find  a  place

and  I  landed  up  finding  a  place  in  Daly

City

and  I  lived  there  until  like  the

pandemic  started  and  then  um  I  decided

to  go  back  to  college  get  my  Masters

and  then  I  and  then  I  went  back  home  for

for  that  duration  of  time  I  was  when  I

was  living  in  Bayview  I  was  teaching  at

a  public  school  in  South  San  Francisco

and  then  um  when  I  left  that  job

um  I  decided  to  to  do  a  private  school

in  the  city  in  San  Francisco  and  thats

where  Ive  been  for  the  past  five  years

and  is  that  because  like  the  pay  is

better  or  is  it

the  best  chaotic  or  it  was  less  chaotic

at  the  time  it  was  like  a  brand  new

school  and  I  was  going  to  be  like  one  of

the  founding  teachers  and  I  just  kind  of

thought  that  was  so  cool  and

um when  I  was  at  the  school  in  South

City  it  was  very  low  funded  and  I  was

teaching  so  many  different  things  and

that  I  wasnt  trained  for  like  PE  I  had

to  teach  music  there  was  no

extracurricular  for  those  kids  it  was

just  difficult  for  my  first  teaching

experience  too

to  be  there

I  mean  I  had  to  go  back  home  a  few  times

so  it  kind  of  affected  my  mom  a  little

bit

um

its  not  actually  reminds  me  there  but  I

think  it  was  just  kind  of

um  weird  for  her  to  have  me  there  and

Im  older

um  and  it  also  made  it  just  really  hard

for  me  to

to  like  be  happy  with  my

job  that  didnt  really  allow  me  to

to  pay  for  for  anything  like  my  income

and  the  housing  choices  just  didnt

match  up

even  though  Im  like  educated  and  stuff

like  that  it  kind  of  just

made  it  a  little  difficult  and  also  it

was  like  like  I  said  in  the  beginning

its  kind  of  like  a  dream  I  always  like

drove  around  the  city  with  my  family

hoping  oh  one  day  I  could  have  these

houses  and  it  just  it  like  all  of  a

sudden  dawned  on me  like  I  cant  make

that  happen  not  let  this

foreign

had  the  have  you  heard  that  the  same

sentiment  with  other  faculty  and  other

teachers

um  a  little  bit  I  know  theres  been  um

some  of  my

my

um  colleagues

they  you  know  they  had  to  like  leave

their  homes  I  know  just  one  teacher  that

um

she  couldnt  afford  it  I  know  one

teacher  that  just  started  last  year  and

um  she  moved  down  to  work  at  my  school

and  then  she  wasnt  getting  paid  enough

and  she  landed  up  quitting  my  job  and

working  at  Petes  because  she  got  paid

more  and  now  she  moved  back  to  like

somewhere  else  but  she  actually  moved

down  the  street  from  my  work  to  work

there  and  couldnt  afford  it

yes  and  so  it  has  like  the  also  has  the

like  lack  of  affordable  housing  and  lack

of  housing  options  kind  of  impacted  or

made  you  consider

not  teaching  anymore  and  like  looking

for  something  else  or  is  it  or  is  it

like  teaching  what  you  want  to  do  and

youre  gonna  oh  its  its  really  what  I

always  wanted  I  always  envisioned  myself

as  a  teacher  however  I  did  get  my

masters  and  probably  in  the  future  Im

probably  going  to  you  know  change  that

and  try  to  look  for  something  better

um

you  know  well  as  I  was  going  to  school  I

was  thinking  I  could  still  work  in  a

school  and  be  a  specialist  or  something

like  that

if  there  was  more  access  to  affordable

housing  and  just  more  affordable  housing

in  general  how  would  that  impact

Educators  on  their  day-to-day  oh  wow

would  be  so  helpful  it  would  be  really

nice

um

like  its  a  stressful  job  and  um

and  to  have  like  that  one  less

you  know  burden  of  high  rent  uh  I  think

it  would  make  a  lot  of  Educators  want  to

stay

near  the  schools  they  teach  at  rather

than  commute  far  it  might  also  make

people  want  to  stay  in  the  teaching

field

and  why  do  you  think  its  important  for

teachers  to

to  have  access  to  housing  within  the

communities  that  they  teach  for  them  oh

um  because  then  they  get  to  know  the

community

of  the  students  I  think  they  connect

better  to  their  students  when  theyre  a

part  of  the  community  I  think  it  would

help  them  really  like  also  bring  the

community  into  the  classroom  it  would  be

easier  to  like  teach  based  off  their

student  interests  and  stuff  like  that

I  guess  because  Im  a  teacher  I  guess

good  schools

um  you  know  maybe

nice  markets  I  guess  community  centers  I

I  think  a  lot  about  kids  when  I  think  of

a  nice  community  and  how  to  keep  them

safe  and

um  you  know  having  a  good  education  and

stuff  like  that

you  know  maybe  more

like  Mom  and  Pop  shops  like  like

supporting  more  local  business  because

that  kind  of  helps  the  community  grow

also  I  feel  like

the  citys  kind  of  like  swaying  away

from  that  a  lot  of  places  are  closing

either  because  theyre  getting  robbed  or

because  people  cant  afford  them

um

major  corporations  you  know  are  kind  of

taking  over  there

um  you  know  I  guess  like  churches  good

schools  good  community  centers

well  I  think  we  should  try  to  make  it

affordable  for  the  working  class

um  it  feels  like  the  middle  class

doesnt  really  get  a  lot  of  opportunity

theyre  kind  of  just  stuck  in  this  like

cycle  of  just  like  working  in  rent

teacher  housing  and  um

maybe  having  more  programs  like  that  I

never  really  looked  into  it  or  applied

for  it  because  Ive  always

like  been  going  to  school  but  now  that

Im  like  more  settled  in  my  my  life  I

could  probably  look  into  that  more  but

maybe  having  programs  like  that  for

First  Responders  and  stuff

find  a  way  to  like  solve  the  homeless

problem  it  just  seems  like  so  crazy

um

and  uh  I  dont  know  finding  some  some

way  to  to  solve  that  problem  I  think  it

um  a  lot  of  people  arent  comfortable

and  it  makes

people  kind  of  slay  away  from  the  city

when  I  was  younger  like  we  used  to  come

down  here  and  we  used  to  like  go

shopping  at  Powell  Street  especially

during  Christmas  and  it  was  like  this

fun  experience  and  we  stopped  doing  that

just  because  of  like  how  run  down  the

city  is  uh  it  would  be  great  if  they

could  lower  the  prices  on  housing

obviously

um  because  you  know  a  lot  of  natives  are

kicked  out

um

even  though  Im  not  from  the  city  itself

Im  a  Bay  area  native  and  it  kind  of

sucks  I  cant  live  around  here
