okay  my  name  is  Suma  rocker

I  came  to  San  Francisco  in  1964.

and  uh  can  you  say  where  you  were  born

Guatemala  Central  America

in  the  city

it  was  my  life  I  live  in  San  Francisco

and  I  applied  for  section  A

it  took  a  while  to

to  get  it  but  I

got  it

and  so  when  you  first  moved  to

California  what  neighborhood  did  you

move  to  oh

and  Sacramento  Street  I  dont  know  is

the  marina  I  dont  know  Sacramento

Street  and  yeah  my  aunt  lived  there  so  I

came  in  stayed  with  my  aunt  yeah

I  dont  know  how  much  you  pay  because  I

was  going  to  school  then

and  what  were  you  going  to  school  for

was  it  for  high  school  or  trade  High

School  yeah  what  high  school  was  that

that  was  first  I  was  going  to  John

OConnell

mm-hmm

and  well  I  went  to  a  school  to  learn

English  too  and  Pacific  Heights  so  after

you  lived  on  Sacramento  Street  what  was

the  next  neighborhood  that  you  moved  to

its  been  so  long  and  Silver  Terrace

in  Ingleside  in  Diamond  Heights  what

area  of  San  Francisco  do  you  live  now

now  yes  Diamond  Heights

and  how  long  have  you  lived  there

a  few  months  because  I  used  to  live  in

San  Bruno

California  I  lived  there  for  nine  years

and  I  moved

back  to  San  Francisco  so  and  your  your

familys  in  San  Francisco  yes  correct

I  worked  for  a  oncologist  Im  a  medical

as  a  medical  assistant

and  I  also  work  in  medical  records  at  St

Lukes  Hospital

but  at  the  beginning  and  when  my  kids

were  young  I  used  to  work  for  the

insurance  company  Metropolitan  Life

yes

and  as  a  single  parent  working  those

jobs  were  you  able  to  afford  housing

which  is  working  one  job

no

it  was  hard  I  had  to  work  later  all  the

time  in  my  children  had  to  stay  by

theirselves

yeah

yeah  I  was  a  single  mother  and  they  went

to  school  and  its  when

a  lady  told  me  about  Section  8  that

should  apply  because  I  used  to  work

Metropolitan  insurance

and  so  she  she  advised  me  to  apply  for

Section  8  which  I  applied  but  it  took  a

while  to

to  get  it  to  be  in  yeah

how  long  would  you  say  it  took  you  to

get  accepted  onto  section  oh

Maybe

six  months  maybe  no  eight  or  six  months

yeah

I  started  getting  into  the  Section  8  you

have  to  wait  a  long  time  and  they  check

to  see  how  much  money  you  make  and

yeah  so  you  mentioned  Section  8  as  a  way

to  pay  for  housing  do  you  think  you  or

your  family  members  would  be  able  to

stay  in  San  Francisco  without  any

assistance  from  for  housing  no  or  still

expensive

and  where  do  you  think  your  family

members  would  be  right  now  if  they

didnt  have  section  8  or  some  kind  of  uh

housing  help  do  you  think  they  would

have  to  be  with  family  members  in  San

Francisco  or  do  you  think  they  would

have  to  leave  San  Francisco  or  leave  the

Bay  Area  and  they  probably  have  to  leave

the  Bay  Area  yeah  do  you  know  family

members  that  had  to  leave  the  Bay  Area

oh  my  daughter

my  oldest  daughter  yeah  she  moved  added

some  cheese  cooks  too  expensive  here

and  granddaughter  Felicia  and  where  did

they  move  my  my  daughter  moved  to

Massachusetts  Felicia  moved  to  Houston

Texas

Ericas  father  hes  a  single  parent  he

has  a  son  and  he  hasnt  been  able  to

to  gate  housing

because  I  I  think  the  waiting  list  is

close

so

hes  having  a  hard  time

yes  but  I  I  could  speak  English  but  I

used  oh  if  I  could  I  helped  somebody

else  you  know  people  they  didnt

understand  I  helped  him  I  was  fortunate

to  speak  a  little  bit  in  English  I

understood  so  you  didnt  notice  though

that  other  community  members  had  a  hard

time  yes  because  there  was  it  was  the

workers  they  didnt  have  translators  or

was  it  all  the  information  was  only  in

English  and  only  information  was  only  in

English  and  they  didnt  have  that  many

people  they  Translate

and  do  you  think  its  still  like  that

now  or  has  it  gotten  better  over  the

years  I  think  it  got  better  yeah

yeah

because  see  now  I  see  the  papers  they

put  in  different  languages  before  it

wasnt  too  much

and  how  important  do  you  think  it  is  for

somebody  to  be  able  to  communicate  like

uh  very  important

yes

and  life  of  death  of  life  because  if  we

a  person  listening  need  and  they  dont

understand  what  she  needs

yes

strategic

because

sometimes  I

trip  and  life

in

I  dont  hear  very  well

in  in  I  cannot  cook  because  I  forget  my

my  memory  is  bad

because  I  started  put  something  in  the

stuff  and  I  forget

and  its  dangerous  because  I  can  cause  a

fire  yeah

yeah  previous  Apartments  they  wear  a  lot

of  stairs  yeah  and  it  was  hard

yeah  and

yeah

and

the  only  thing  was  good  there  was

Transportation  but

in  the  house  I  mean  the  apartments  where

run  down  they  understanding

take  care  of  much  this  was  interesting

and  they  rent  yeah

just  take  bus  Embark  a  train

yes  but  not  anymore  because

its  dangerous  and  Im  old  now  so

do  you  think  if  if  it  was  easier  and  you

had  more  access  to  it  like  youd  still

maybe  take  it  or  if  it  was  just  like

right  outside  of  your  apartment  you

think  youd  be  able  to

you  think  you  would  still  take  it  places

or

yeah  I  think  I  could  take  a  bit  Im

scared  because  all  the  things  are

happening  yeah  I  used  to  travel  a  lot

you  know  the  next  I  dont  drive  so  I

defended  on  Transportation

in  this  apartment  there  I  have  now  has

Transportation  right  by  my  door  so  yeah

a  community  center  maybe  yeah

and

have  a

store  nearby  I  mean

yeah  and

the  transportation  because  thats

important

parks  for  the  children  to  play

in

in

seniors  senior

you  know  where  they  can  go  seniors  how

do  you  say  them  like  senior  centers  yeah

senior  centers  yeah  and

yeah  and  like  I  said  building  more

house  affordable  housing  for  the

people  are  homeless  they  needed

a  little

um  no  more  than  the  Safeway

in  Walgreens  and  so  a  little  what  would

you  say  a  little  shopping  center  yeah

thank  you  shopping  center  yeah  yeah  and

the  bus  stops  right  in  front  of  my

apartment  so  yeah

but  like  I  said  I  dont  take  it  too  much

now  because  Im  getting  off  Im  off

I  used  to  take  my  children  to  Golden

Gate  Park  but  they  have  concerts  yeah

thatd  be  nice  every  day  yeah  and

what  else  I  think  yeah  to  the  park  I  was

because  I  couldnt  afford  to  take  them

somewhere  else  so  we  used  to  you  know  I

used  to  take  to  Golden  Gate  Park  because

Chinatown  and  you  know  they  have  the

Chinese  Garden  everything  was  free

in  the  aquarium  to

it  was  free  so  we  used  to  go  on  the

weekends  up  there  yeah

but  now  its  impossible

I  wish  they  they  went  to  go  down  and

more  help  and  people  would  work  together

make  it  nice  and  clean  because  now  its

getting  down  because  a  lot  of  homeless

people

be  nice  if  they  can  build  more  housing

affordable  housing  for  people  they  need
