uh  Ben  Wong  executive  director  of

Wyoming  School

born  and  raised  in  San  Francisco  San

Francisco  native  mostly  originally

actually  in  the  Chinatown  North  Beach

area

but  as  my  brother  got  into  a  ball

and  in  the  early  70s  we  were  part  of

that  wave  of  Chinese  American  families

who  came  to  the  sunset  we  my  parents

bought  a  house  out  here  on  31st  and

Judah  and  so  we  moved  at  that  time  and

so  my  middle  school  and  high  school

years  and  much  my  adult  has  been  on  the

west  side  of  San  Francisco

but  this  was  early  70s  were  probably  one

of  the  first  wave  quite  frankly  of

chinese-american  families  who  found  the

sunset  to  be  affordable  I  was  a  kid  but

will  tell  you  that  when  it  came  to  the

sunset  well  first  of  all  it  didnt  even

know  since  it  existed  I  grew  up  in

Chinatown  North  Beach  I  felt  felt  very

far  away  but  clearly  I  had  this

conversation  with  my  brother  many  many

years  ago  it  was  sort  of  that  move  that

we  felt  like  we  moved  to  the  middle

class  it  was  less  dense  it  had  a  wider

neighborhood  and  parks  that  had

libraries  that  had  just  things  that  were

more  sort  of  spread  out  so  very  much

felt  like  we  moved  to  the  middle  class

and  Ive  only  discovered  later  that

thats  exactly  what  it  was  is  that

Sunset  was  very  very  much  more  middle

class  much  more  affordable  housing

schools  those  kinds  of  things  I  didnt

know  that  at  the  time  but  had  lived  then

in  the  sunset  all  through  my  high  school

middle  school  high  school  college  Years

in  the  video  but  truth  be  known  we  used

a  fake  address  because  this  is  also

during  busing  and  so  I  went  to  an

elementary  school  closer  back  to  North

Beach  Chinatown  but  not  using  the

address  out  here  to  do  so  like  all  of

those

was  just  part  of  my  history  and

experience  and  background  of  the  times

basically  I  currently  ever  live  in  the

Richmond  District  so  still  on  the  West

Side  some  other  than  my  early  years  in

China

not  the  most  part  Ive  been  down  here  in

the  west  side

Ive  been  executor  here  at  wami  school

for  the  last  seven  years  and  so  its  uh

definitely  a  re-acquaintance  for  me  I

already  back  here  on  the  sunset  so

what  we  were  I  have  to  say  fortunate

again  to  get  in  early  in  the  early  70s

my  parents  bought  the  house  its  going

to  blow  you  away  bought  the  house  its  a

regular  Sunset  house  for  thirty  two

thousand  dollars  basically  and  in  fact  I

remember  very  distinctly  that  my  uncle

who  moved  in  across  the  street  about  a

year  or  a  year  and  a  half  later  paid

significantly  more  so  we  were  just  Again

part  of  that  first  wave  of  families

moving  out  to  the  sunset

um  my  dad  had  owned  that  house  probably

until

a  good  30-year  35  years  and  when  he  sold

it  it  was  like  close  to  a  million

dollars  and  so  again  my  dad  was  a

blue-collar  immigrant

speak  the  language  and  so  imagine  that

he  could  go  from  like  a  dense

neighborhood  of  Chin  Chan  North  Beach

to  owning  a  house  thats  worth  a  million

dollars  is  pretty  significantly

incredible  you  think  about  it  it  was

really  really  that  timing  of  what  we

would  consider  the  really  the  real

American  story

could  we  buy  a  house  today  and  a  million

dollars  no

he  was  blue  color  my  mom  worked  for  the

government  so  not  really  really  like

professional  level  type

professions  basically

um  we  were  probably

same  situation  where  I  think  a  lot  of

families  are  which  is  what  they  consider

acid  Rich  cash  poor  which  is  dont  make

enough  income  really  to  buy  that  house

but  youre  there  because  thats  what  the

previous  generation  had  invested  in  so

thats  what  I  think  happens  a  lot  here

in  the  sunset

I  probably  would  say  less  about  the  kids

who  come  to  this  school  in  that  regard

although  it  does  exist

I  will  tell  you  that  I  worked  with  young

people  by  my  professional  background

basically  is  child  Youth  Development  and

so  Ive  done  work  in  Chinatown  been

working  different  parts  of  the  city  and

clearly  most  all  the  young  people  that  I

know  cant  afford  to  live  in  San

Francisco  so  the  vast  majority  of  them

who  now  are  in  their  30s  and  40s  live

outside  of  San  Francisco  they  still  have

affiliations  to  San  Francisco  right  they

still  come  here  for  the  restaurants  is

where  they  meet  socially  all  those

things  and  a  lot  of  their  friends  are

still  in  San  Francisco  but  the  vast

majority  of  them  really  do  live  outside

of  San  Francisco  I  think  thats  where  I

see  the  greatest  impact  is  these  people

who  are  born  and  raised  here  cant

really  afford  to  stay  here

my  own  niece  and  nephews  live  in  Oakland

and  they  were  born  and  raised  in  San

Francisco  they  would  love  to  be  here  in

San  Francisco  they  just  cant  afford  it

and  so  my  niece  actually  her  and  her

partner  basically  are  non-profit  workers

and  so  so  thats  I  think  another

population  so  teachers  non-profit

workers  right  really  just  cant  afford

to  live  here  so  so  the  vast  majority  of

them  will  say  San  Francisco  has  changed

some  of  it  is  because  of  the  density

some  of  it  is  traffic  some  of  it  is

crime  the  the  main  reason  I  think  people

really  will  cite  is  really  just  an

affordability  and  then  when  youre

making  comparison  between  what  you  can

get  here  what  you  can  get  in  other

places  in  the  Bay  Area  they  feel  like

well  dollar  for  dollar  might  make  more

sense

to  go  outside  of  San  Francisco  Ill  say

that  I  think  theres  also  like  a  level

of  comfortability  to  go  outside  San

Francisco  because  theres  still  rooms

here  in  San  Francisco  so  many  of  us  are

still  here  so  they  feel  like  either  they

can  still  come  back  to  visit  or  those

because  they  have  to  say  though  nowadays

we  spend  more  time  going  out  to  Oakland

than  people  coming  back  into  San

Francisco  so

Im  guessing  its  two  this  is  just  sort

of  anecdotal

right  those  who  I  think  are  immigrant

isolated  may  not  speak  the  language  have

housing  barriers  mostly  because  of

income  and  language  and  then  I  think

young  people  who  in  two  ways  which  is

that  if  they  choose  and  want  to  choose

to  live  in  San  Francisco  just  cant

afford  it  and  so  that  includes  a  lot  of

your  young  families  you  know  the  people

who  are  just  partnering  coupling  up  and

getting  having  children

many  of  them  are  actually  living  outside

of  school  you  have  to  be  in  what  we

would  consider  the  San  Francisco  middle

class  which  is  pretty  high  level

professions  so  Architects  you  know

lawyers  those  are  the  San  Francisco

middle  class  not  the  nurses  and  the

teachers  that  really  really  need  to  be

here  and  so  thats  where  I  see  theres  a

huge  impact  so  I  think  part  of  our  work

at  Wawa  May  release  to  focus  and

remember  our  target  audience  really  is

those  nurses  and  teachers

well  I  think  one  of  the  challenges  I

think  San  Francisco  has  had  is  it  has

built  housing  it  doesnt  mean  it  hasnt

been  housing  I  think  problem  it  has  is

built  high-rise  market  rate  housing  and

mostly  on  the  east  side  of  San  Francisco

and  so  then  theres  a  real  from  my

perspective  as  I  think  thats  been  a

failed  policy  to  be  honest  with  you  I

just  dont  think  its  been  Equitable  I

dont  think  it  makes  any  sense  to  be

honest  with  you  I  think  the  idea  that

housing  is  by  nature  trickle  down

doesnt  work  in  the  same  way  that  other

economic  parameters  might  become  right

so  I  think  there  needs  to  be  an  effort

around  specifically  housing

affordability  at  all  levels  and  it

doesnt  necessarily  mean  that  you

wouldnt  build  marketing  housing  but

clearly  theres  a  focus  that  needs  to

happen  for  a  middle  income  lower  income

families  because  what  has  happened  in

the  last

20  years  around  Mercury  housing  has  not

been  all  that  effective  I  think

I  think  its  policy  but  I  think  its

policy  it  has  to  be  driven  by  our  values

and  so  the  the  very  idea  that  much  of

who  came  into  San  Francisco  was  a  lot  of

the  startups  a  lot  of  social  media  a  lot

of  the  people  who  actually  had  access

already  with  and  while  ignoring  sort  of

like  how  those  sort  of  people  get  served

and  this  is  this  is  sort  of  like  that

class  question  I  think

around  its  not  a  sustainable  economic

model

um  and  so

so  I  think  it  just  has  to  be  served  at

all  levels  and  I  dont  have  a  policy

prescription  were  not  Im  not

Im  not  smart  enough  to  have  a  policy

prescription  in  that  regard  I  do  think

though  that  there  has  to  be  a  values

driven  kind  of  question  though  Im  not

opposed  to  economic  Vitality  but  it  has

to  be  economic  fatality  at  all  levels

that  and  I  think  thats  what  gets  the

best  and  I  think  we  tend  to  look  at  the

top  and  thinking  everything  trickles

down  anything  time  and  time  and  again

its  shown  that  its  actually  its  not

true  so  you  also  think  about  it  in  terms

of  minimum  wage  you  think  a  lot  in  terms

of  rent  control  laws  right  is  everyone

has  to  have  a  balance  so

yeah  this  this  is  gonna  get

controversial  but  I  do  want  to  see  more

more  housing  available  in  the  west  side

the  map  that  I  saw  from  San  Francisco

playing  Department  around  where  the

housing  has  been  built  and  where  it

hasnt  is  phenomenally  Stark  and  really

unacceptable  for  for  a  city  policy  right

for  a  city  for  approach  that  says  we  we

deserve  and  respect  all  income  levels

and  all  all  people  residents  San

Francisco  its  unconscionable  to  be

honest  with  you  and  so  so  this  idea  that

were  going  to  build  more  house  more

density  more  affordable  housing  more

housing  affordability  on  the  West  Side

actually  support  I  actually  think  its

the  right  move  I  think  its  a  move  that

we  that  we  delayed  way  too  long  and  part

of  I  think  the  issue  and  challenge  right

now  with  the  west  side  is  unfamiliarity

with  density  entrepreneuriality  with  new

housing  and  familiarity  with  housing

affordability  and  familiarity  with

affordable  housing  what  it  is  and  what

is  not  and  so  thats  part  of  the  work

that  I  think  were  doing  here  at  wami  is

trying  to  help  support  residence

neighborhoods  the  character  the

neighborhood  could  remain  but  really  is

the  idea  that  we  want  more  people  here

because  we  love  this  neighborhood

community  so  much  and  so  hows  density

its  not  going  to  change  that  its  going

to  support  it  so

probably  the  the  merchant  quarters  you

know  Sunset  Richmond  also  it  really  is

really  well  blessed  with  a  lot  of

individual  uh  small  small  Merchants

basically  the  merchant  Corridor  is  an

Irving  Judah  noria  and  Taraval  really

builds  a  character  for  neighborhood

right  and  so  those  are  the  kinds  of

things  that  I  think  people  want  to  see

maintained  I  also  think  that  we  could  do

better  in  terms  of  Transportation  so  San

Francisco  sorry  Sunset  is  geographically

quite  large  and  so  there  are  buses  and

and  and  sort  of  the  street  cars  out  here

but  it  could  be  kind  of  a  walk  so  if  you

dont  quite  realize  that  because  its

Sunset  its  one  neighborhood  everyone

thinks  its  one  neighbor  actually

theres  a  lot  of  smaller  neighborhoods

within  the  district  itself  that  people

dont  quite  realize  and  so  I  think  the

character  of  those  Merchant  quarters  are

really  really  important

well  Ill  say  this  which  is  I  grew  up in

Sunset  theres  not  enough  in  fact  there

arent  any  child  team  youth  centers  out

here

um  people  dont  know  this  but  sunset

according  to  the  state  is  a  high

priority  for  child  care  people  wouldnt

think  that  mostly  because  a  lot  of  the

child  care  out  here  is  home-based  but

theres  wame  is  one  of  the  few

center-based  programs  out  here  in  the

sunset  so  I  would  like  to  see  more  of

those  type  of  services  everything  from

you  know  immigrant  Services  Legal

Services  those  kinds  of  things  that  are

needed  out  here  many  of  the  people

actually  here  in  the  sunset  go  to

Chinatown  for  their  services  whereas

we  could  be  doing  that  out  here  on  the

West  Side  so  not  so  much  that  what  I

would  take  a  benefit  of  because  I  think

that  I  have  accessibility  I  have  a  car

Im  educated  I  can  move  around  I  do

think  that  immigrant  populations  I  think

I  think  seniors  I  think  isolated  seniors

I  think  theres  just  a  number  of  I  think

young  families  really  could  use  a  lot

more  support  out  here

so  of  course  I  speak  for  a  while  made

school  which  is  just  bilingual  education

so  clearly  one  of  the  things  weve

actually  been  working  with  the  city  on

is  ensuring  that  as  we  talk  about

housing  we  talk  about  then  all  the

neighborhood  services  that  has  to  go

with  it  right  and  that  includes  child

care  after  school  programs  leadership

programs  teen  centers  those  kinds  of

places  and  so  thats  the  kind  of  service

work  that  wed  like  to  see  go  hand  in

hand  with  housing  if  you  talk  about

neighborhoods  I  think  it  is  ensuring

that  people  have  access  to  the  kind  of

services  they  need  on  a  regular  basis  so

for  seniors  is  access  to  pharmacies  it

is  open  spaces  for  people  to  walk  it  is

libraries  for  people  to  like  borrow  or

rent  do  the  kinds  of  things  they  need  to

do

uh  it  is  the  connectedness  that  people

have  they  feel  a  part  of  that

neighborhood  that  they  feel  like  they

have  a  stake  in  that  neighborhood

again  there  is  elements  of  that  out  here

on  the  West  side

geographically  large  I  think  there  is

this  sense  a  potential  sense  of

disconnectedness

I  also  think  you  know  I  mentioned  the

the  three  major  corridors  which  is

Irving  Noriega  Taraval  you  know  if  you

live  in  a  Cantara  and  30  whatever  it  is

youre  using  a  car  theres  a  hill  I

dont  think  that  actually  people  even

know  theres  Hills  and  students  on  that

District  you  know  because  its  its  a

grid  its  a  straight  grid  unlike  some

other  neighborhoods  right  its  a

straight  grid  so  you  think  its  an  easy

shot  it  could  be  kind  of  a  challenge

sometimes  to  get  from  a  particular  place

to  one  of  the  major  quarters  so  more

access  to  that  kind  of  Transportation

better  bike  Lanes  maybe  you  know  those

kinds  of things  I  dont  think  we  can

flatten  the  hell  but  certainly  you  know

ways  of  actually  having  sort  of  easier

access  you  know  as  I  get  older  it  is  one

of  the  things  that  I  think  about  is  like

well  if  I  live  on  Hell  hows  this  going

to  work  right  how  do  you  really  get

Mobility  quite  frankly  uh  to  the  things

you  need

so  Ive  said  this  so  I  grew  up  in  North

Beach  I  did  a  lot  of  my  work  was  in

Chinatown  and  North  Beach  very  dense

neighborhood  lots  of  issues  and

challenges  it  is  a  very  vibrant

neighborhood

of  community  services  that  supports

immigrant  families  there  but  but  I  tell

people  this  when  they  move  into  San

Francisco

people  tend  to  move  into  the  high  high

talked  about  areas  the  Hayes  Valley  the

mission  as  when  youre  really  ready  to

move  into  San  Francisco  you  move  into

the  return  of  the  sunset  because  you

found  settled  in  and  so  there  is  a  thing

about  sort  of  the  Richmond  and  South

effect  I  just  had  this  conversation

yesterday  with  somebody  around  the

restaurants  and  so  I  said  you  know

Richmond  and  sunset  isnt  necessarily

destination  neighborhoods  but  theres

some  really  great  eats  out  here  I  think

thats  the  best  way  to  think  about  it

which  is  people  might  not  be  driving  to

the  sunset  to  go  to  a  restaurant  but  boy

once  youre  here  you  know  theres  a  its

sort  of  a  I  would  say  a  Hidden  Gem  but

certainly  theres  a  lot  to  be  uh  proud

about  sort  of  the  neighborhood  and  I

think  thats  how  I  think  about  the

Richmond  and  sunset  which  is  when  you

really  went  into  settlement  its  going

to  be  their  human  Sunset  mostly  because

it  has  sort  of  that  balance  of  the

things  youre  looking  for  Right  grocery

stores  and  and  good  restaurants  and  some

of  the  good  bars  you  know  those  kinds  of

things  but  not  necessarily  the  hype  or

the  hustle  and  bustle  of  other  parts  of

the  city

okay  and  Ill  start  with  overthrow  of

capitalism

um  but  aside  from  that

certainly  I  think  a  place  where  people

who  born  and  raised  in  San  Francisco  can

feel  like  its  still  their  city

Im  not  entirely  sure  I  think  theres

elements  of  that  I  think  about  how  it

got  lost

um

but  I  dont  know  if  anybody  has  a  firm  a

handle  on  that  and  what  that  even  means

perfectly

now  I  say  that  because  Im  a  San

Francisco  native  right  so  its  one  of

those  where  its  its  just  its  kind  of

sad  that  people  who  born  and  raised  here

doesnt  feel  like  that  they  can  be  here

and  in  fact  really  can  say  I  think  they

dont  I  dont  know  if  they  even  feel

like  its  their  City  anymore  and  so

thats  something  thats  just  odd  to  me

being  in  San  Francisco  native  so  I  would

like  to  capture  some  of  the  back  and

some  of  that  is  tied  to  affordability

and  housing  affordability  and  I  think  we

can  manage  some  of  the  other  questions

of  density  and  parking  and  traffic  and

those  kinds  of  things  I  think  many  of  us

have  sort  of  accustomed  to  that

um  but  if  you  cant  afford  to  be  there

then  its  then  its  almost  like  its  not

worth  the  fight  and  so  I  think  housing

is  such  a  critical  part  to  that

um  I  I  trust  San  Francisco  enough  to

know  that  well  figure  out  the

neighborhood  services  as  the  housing

gets  built  theres  enough  Advocates  out

here  theres  enough  community  members

theres  enough  strong  voices  to  make

sure  that  happens

but  I  think  its  tied  again  just  to  the

quality  of  life  that  were  looking  for

and  looking  at  we  live  in  an  amazing

City  like  Im  really  really  proud  to  be

in  San  Francisco  and  I  really  am  and  so

I  I  want  to  continue  to  maintain  that

level  of  Hope

lets  go

um  but  it  does  the  policies  do  have  to

change

a  quarter  for  that  to  happen
