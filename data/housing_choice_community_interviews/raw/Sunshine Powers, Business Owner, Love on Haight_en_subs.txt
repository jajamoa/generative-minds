my  name  is  sunshine  Powers  I  own  Lavon

hate  on  the  corner  of  hate  and  Masonic

we  are  a  legacy  business  and  a  artist

Collective  of  over  200  tie-dye  artists  I

also  own  the  non-profit  colors  of  Love

on  stanyan  or  I  founded  the  non-profit

colors  of  Love  on  stanyan  and  Frederick

Street  we  are  a  womens  prisoner

re-entry  tie-dye  program  as  well  as  a

tie-dye  education  center  for  the

community

I  grew  up  in  San  Francisco  my  parents

still  live  in  the  same  house  over  by

Ocean  Beach  in  the  Richmond  that  hate  to

me  I  first  came  to  the  hate  when  I  was

12  and  in  high  school  and  I  didnt  have

any  friends  and  really  stuck  out  and  I

came  to  the  hate  and  it  um

it  made  it  feel  okay  to  be  me

and  when  I  moved  away  from  the  city

I  had  a  hard  time  coming  back  to  the

hate  once  I  moved  back  because  Jerry

Garcia  had  died  when  I  was  15  and  that

was  very  as  of  San  Franciscan  it  shook

us  as  a  city

but  one  of  my  friends  bought  the  shop  in

2012  and  I  had  missed  my  corner  so  I

came  back  here  and  uh  together  we  made

it  our  mission  to  revitalize  hate  Street

and  to  bring  back  the  color  creativity

and  Consciousness  that  hate  street  is

historically  known  for

one  of  the  biggest  issues  that  I  had  in

the  beginning  was  the  40  homeless  youth

that  were  outside  of  the  shop  it  was  not

good  for  business  in  fact  the  big  tour

bus  used  to  stop  in  front  of  the  shop

which  was  great  for  the  shop  and  they

stopped  doing  that  in  2013  due  to  the

homeless  problem  that  was  outside

um

I  tried  many  different  things  there  may

have  been  glitter  involved

and  I  slowly  learned  that  you  cant  just

tell  people  to  leave  you  actually  have

to  give  them  a  place  to  go  we  work  with

several  non-profits  helping  house  the

homeless  youth  of  our  homeless  whos  75

of  them  are  LGBT  that  have  come  to  the

Haight  Ashbury  from  Middle  America  or

from  the  south  where  its  not  okay  to  be

them  so  it  would  be

very  unhate  Ashbury  of  us  to  not  try  to

house  them  and  help  them  find

a  safe  space  here  because  to  me  ever

since  I  was  a  little  girl  the  hate  has

always  been  a  safe  space  and  if  theres

anything  that  we  try  to  do  as  a  company

it  is  to  keep  that  for  whoever  enters

whether  theyre  here  just  for  a  minute

or  for  the  Long  Haul

thank  you

my  housing  story  in  San  Francisco  in  San

Francisco  is  that  you  know  my  parents

still  live  in  the  same  house  I  grew  up

in  so  when  the  economy  crashed  in  08  and

I  lost  like  everything  like  a  country

music  song  uh  I  came  back  and  lived  in

my  parents  basement  because  theres

thats  work  to  do  when  you  start  over

and  I  lived  in  the  tenderloin  for  six

years  because  it  was  the  only  spot  I

could  afford  to  live  by  myself  and  Im

not  good  with  roommates

um  and  that  was  like

free  TV  at  its  finest  with  no

commercials  so  that  was  like  a  little

intense

um and  I  was  very  fortunate  to  be  able

to  move  to  the  Haight  Ashbury  District

after  working  here  for  some  time

and  uh  it  wasnt  easy  and  I  hustled  but

it  happened

I  guess  when  I  get  got  the  shop  things

shifted  for  me  I  received  money  from  one

of  the  donors  to  our  homeless  youth

non-profit  to  buy  the  shop  so  instead  of

giving  them  the  money  back  I  get  to  give

all  the  money  back  into  the  community  so

that  definitely  was  a  life-changing

experience  for  me

um

at  this  current  moment  Im  very

privileged  to  um own  a  flat  just  a

couple  blocks  away  someone  had  to  die

and  we  had  to  borrow  some  money  but  we

did  it  and  were  grateful  and  now  were

house  poor

but  theres  that  was  definitely  a  thing

for  me  when  I  was  younger  and  in  my  30s

was  trying  to  find  housing  here  that  I

felt  safe  and  as  a  woman  I  would  walk

from  the  Haight  Ashbury  to  the

tenderloin  very  late  at  night  and  it

wasnt  necessarily  something  that  I

wanted  to  do  but  I  also  didnt  feel  safe

on  public  transportation  as  a  Woman  by

myself

uh  walking  I  feel  like  I  got  more

options  uh  anyway

um

being  a  employer  here  in  the  city  I

definitely  noticed  that  housing  just  I

couldnt  keep  a  good  employee  it  was

really  hard  for  me  to  do  anything  like

that

one  of  the  really  hard  things  about

employing  people  here  in  the  Haight

Ashbury  and  in  the  city  was  finding  them

finding  a  place  to  live  you  know  could

they  get  to  work  on  time  were  they  safe

is  it  for  us  we  have  200  artists  so  for

me  to  train  someone  its  like  a  three  to

six  month  process  its  not  something

that  like  I  cant  take  short-term

employees  thats  just  not  our  Jam  here

and  its  a  waste  of  my  time  and  my

resources  and  my  staff

with  the  pandemic  that  was

humbling  and  we  were  the  first  small

business  in  San  Francisco  to  close  and

we  stayed  close  for  about  a  year

during  that  time  we  uh  redid  the  inside

of  the  shop  and  outside  the  shop  and  I

built  an  online  store

and  I  started  to  get  back  new  employees

because  I  had  lost  all  of  my  employees

in  the  pandemic  including  one  that  had

been  with  me  for  seven  years

and  um

the  landlord  upstairs

asked  if  I  wanted  a  studio  because  we

started  getting  busy  again  but  we  had

like

500  milk  crates  for  our  online  store  in

the  shop  because  we  had  been  closed  so

we  just  put  everything  in  the  shop  so

then  we  moved  the  milk  crates  upstairs

but  going  up  and  down  stairs  with  uh

inventory  is  not  fun  and  I  am  a  woman

that  goes  like  this  so  like  then  we  had

to  get  another  apartment  and  then

another  apartment  opened  upstairs  and  uh

two  of  my  employees  couldnt  find  a

house  so  I  moved  them  upstairs  and  I  was

like  you  know  Ill  pay  part  of  the  rent

as  the  company  you  hang  out  here  a

really  awesome  thing  if  the  alarm  goes

off  I  dont  have  to  rush  over  I  mean  I

do  rush  over  here  but  its  like  someone

gets  there  really  quick  and  I  really

appreciate  that  as  a  business  owner  and

I  have  to  be  frank  the  housing  situation

in  the  beginning  was  um

a  lot  you  got  to  work  out  the  Kinks

there  are  Kinks  and  I  think  one  good

thing  is  you  know  if  there  was  a

temporary  spot  where  while  people  figure

out  whether  or  not  theyre  going  to  work

for  the  company  or  not  like  if  theyre

having  a  hard  time  with  housing  that

that  would  be  clutch  because  I  dont

want  to  have  someone  that  hasnt  worked

for  me  for  six  for  six  months  it  used  to

be  three  I  think  six  is  a  good  thing

some  people  you  know  but

you  never  really  know  someone  and  that

six  months  really  gives  that  time

my  husband  told  me  its  not  about  hiring

the  right  person  its  about  firing  the

wrong  person  as  quickly  as  possible  so  I

really  uh  aim  to

just  keep  people  that  are  in  it  for  the

long  haul  were  on  a  greater  Mission

here  than  just  tie-dye  and  um

once  you  find  those  people  though  you

want  to  keep  you  want  to  keep  them  you

dont  want  them  to  to  leave  and  then  you

want  them  to  know  their  neighbors  you

want  them  to  care  you  want  them  to  shop

local  you  want  them  to  not  have  to  deal

with  parking  and  to  really  feel  like

theyre  in  a  safe  community

um

recently  we  had  like  tie-dye  hippie

Olympics  with  the  dead  and  Company  in

town  and  we  as  a  company  were  able  to

really  um

be  able  to  shift  our  financial  status

because  of  it  and  due  to  that  were  now

offering  a  housing  credit  to  anyone

thats  been  here  for  over  six  months

because  I  cant  at  this  point  provide

affordable  housing  for  them

all  I  would  like  to

um  but  that  doesnt  mean  that  I  should

treat  other  people  differently  if  I

cant  like  because  I  get  a  housing

credit  if  they  live  above  the  shop  and  I

might  as  well  give  the  people  that  dont

live  above  the  shop  that  same  housing

credit  because  thats  fair  Im  really

blessed  that  somehow  most  almost  all  of

my  employees  live  in  the  neighborhood  I

just  think  that  really  shifts  things  a

lot  you  know  I  really  wish  when  theyre

doing  these  housing  projects  like  the

730  stand  in  that  they  allocated  part  of

that  to  people  that  work  for  the  small

businesses  inside  the  neighborhood

because  that  just  creates  better

community  and  theyre  not  putting  any

parking  over  there  so  you  dont  want

people  that  have  to  go  very  far  and  I

understand  were  pushing  public

transportation

I  as  a  woman  dont  feel  safe  on  public

transportation  and  we  just  got  rid  of

the  pandemic  so  that  I  mean  were  still

dealing  with  it  so  I  feel  like  while

its  a  magical  goal  its  also  one  we

have  to  be  more  realistic  about  out  and

take  slower  smaller  steps  to  really  make

sure  were  not  doing  negative  impacts  on

the  community

so  dealing  with  the  stresses  of  finding

housing  affects  my  employees  and  affects

me  and  it  affects  the  business  and  when

you  take  that  out  of  the  business

from  a  pure  business  point  of  view

really  awesome

uh  so  for  my  employees  they  feel  safe

you  know  I

my  last  boss  was  not

I  really  made  it  a  goal  when  I  bought

the  shop  to  be  the  boss  that  I  wanted  to

have

yeah  Im  a  kick-ass  worker  and  Im  a

great  worker  and  I  never  got

acknowledged  and  I  never  felt  safe  and  I

always  it  was  never  really  a  team  and  I

really  wanted  to  shift  that  and  it  took

a  really  it  didnt  happen  like  that  I

would  say  right  now  after  having  the

business  myself  for  almost  seven  years

I  finally  feel  safe  in  my  team  I  finally

feel  like  I  can  go  do  these  other

projects  that  Ive  wanted  to  do  and

um

you  know  since  I  started  housing  the

employees  the  business  is  up  by  120  so

you  know  I  paid  my  employees  more  and  I

housed  them  and  in  turn  my  business  more

than  doubled  so  for  for  me  its  a

win-win  for  everybody  and  I  really  I

dont  understand  why  we  as  a  city  arent

housing  more  people  and  this  is  totally

off  topic  but  I  really  dont  understand

as  we  as  a  city  arent  buying  real

estate  because  were  spending  and

wasting  so  much  money  that  we  could

actually  buy  real  estate  and  have  Equity

Investments  that  just  seem  logical  to  me

I  dont  know  if  you  heard  about  the  high

school  in  Mill  Valley  but  they  uh  like

years  ago  the  woman  bought  all  these

houses  for  her  teachers  and  today  like

its  one  of  the  most  richest  high  school

like  literally  they  have  houses  in  Mill

Valley  theyve  had  for  30  years  and  they

have  professors  from  Harvard  that  come

and  teach  these  kids  high  school  because

theres

houses  like  the  amount  of  talent  that

you  can  get  I  literally

moved  a  tie-dyer  out  here  from  Colorado

and  a  big  thing  that  I  was  able  to  do

because  it  was  like  she  has  housing  you

know  and  its  like  how  often  do  you  find

an  African-American  woman

MBA  graduate  that  you  can  move  out  of

his  housing  I  wouldnt  be  able  to  have

the  talent  that  I  have  if  I  didnt  offer

a  housing  thats  or  if  I  didnt  pay  what

I  pay  thats  just  not  and

that  would  cost  me  more  if  I  didnt  have

that  its  um  it  takes  a  while  to  figure

out  and  its  not  like  when  youre

looking  like  this  you  dont  see  it

youre  like  oh  that  might  no  no  but  when

you  step  back  and  you  actually  are  able

to  look  at  the  bigger  picture  you

understand  that  in  the  long  run  if  you

are

trying  to  carry  on  a  legacy  business

that  is  what  you  have  to  do

um  the  hate  has  changed  over  the  years

because  of  the  housing  crisis

so

be

it

shifts  the  community  and  like  people

like  whove  only  been  here  for  five

years  they  really  freak  out  about  stuff

and  its  like  yeah  man  you  need  a  few

more  years  on  you  like  literally  I  had

someone  complaining  about  the  doom  and

Loom  thing  of  the  city  and  I  was  like

you  werent  here  in  the  80s  whats  going

on  like  this  is  great

uh  its  like  the  cycle  that  we  go  on  as

a  city  like  its  gonna

and  um

but  the  idea  that  some  of  the  long-term

residents  are  forced  to  leave

it  takes  away  that

Sparkle  that  is  part  of  the  hate  we  are

a  community  here  more  than  any  place  I

have  ever  lived  we  are  like  this

tight-knit  community  and  we  take  care  of

each  other  we  take  care  of  our  neighbors

and  its  really  hard  on  us  when  one  of

them  has  to  leave  because  rent  goes  up

or  some  ridiculous  thing  is  happening

that  doesnt  make  sense  and  I  also  think

that  we  need  to  really  stop

like  a  little  bit  of  money  when

someones  about  to  become  homeless  or

about  to  leave  would  really  be  so  much

more  cost  effective  than  having  the

person  become  homeless  so  like  its  like

that  long  like  stepping  back  and  looking

like  this  like  okay  yes  you  might  be

giving  them  five  thousand  dollars  to

help  with  two  months  of  rent  but  thats

much  cheaper  than  having  to  Care  House

feet  like  all  of  these  things  for  a

person  when  they  become  homeless

and  especially  with  our  elders  it  is

um

rude  what  we  do  to  them  and  it  is  not

fair  and  that  is  not  Community  Based  and

it  would  just  be  nicer  if  we  had  more

community  housing  food  shelter  water

these  are  basic  human  rights  that  we

should  all  have

and  um

I  just  dont  understand  why  it  hasnt

happened  yet

I  feel  like  the  housing  crisis  has

really

forced  a  lot  of  The  Artisans  that  used

to  be  in  the  city  out

its  not  easy

you  know

I  havent  paid  myself  really  in  like

four  years  like  Im  really  lucky  that  I

have  a  situation  with  my  husband  that  he

knows  that  were  working  for  something

bigger

and  um

but  man  if  I  had  to  pay  myself  Id

really  be  in  trouble  here

uh  its  its  hard  to  be  an  artist  in  the

city  its  hard  to  be  able  to  live  you

have  to  hustle  and  some  people  arent

capable  of  that  some  people  need  a  time

out  some  peoples  personality  isnt  like

and  like  you  have  to  be  like  that  in  the

city  and  it  can  get  tiring  and  if  youre

not  from  the  city  it  might  be  like  whoa

this  is  a  lot  now  if  youre  from  the

city  youre  like  I  got  this  its  Tuesday

but  its  um

its  not  easy  to  be  an  artist  you  pretty

much  have  to  have  a  couple  side  hustles

a  real  job  and  another  Hustle  you  know

and  maybe  like  volunteer  with  some

social  media  marketing  for  music  so  you

can  go  to  shows  for  free

tip

my  idea  of  a  thriving  Community  is

honestly  going  back  to  what  I  said

before  people  that  really  use  the

community  as  much  as  possible  I  wanted

to  open  up  a  shopping  Union  Square  like

I  love  Union  Square  I  want  to  help

Revitalize  it  it  needs  more  rainbows  why

not  but  I  was  like  is  there  a  way  I  can

link  up  with  some  sort  of  affordable

housing  here  because  Im  not  gonna  open

up  a  shop  if  I  cant  get  laid  Im  not

asking  for  free  housing  Im  asking  for

affordable  housing  Im  asking  for  like

where  everyone  can  live  together  maybe

walk  home  so  they  feel  safe  and  all  that

like  little  other  action  you  have  to

have  food  and  grocery  stores  clutch  you

have  to  have  parking  if  its  not  a

walkable  neighborhood  and  the  reality  is

that  you  should  have  some  parking  we

have  keys  our  stadium  so  like  theres

some  sort  of  parking  area  and  there

should  be  that  that  is

its  not  good  on  peoples  human

existence

have  to  find  a  parking  spot  for  like  two

hours  thats  just  not  safe  and  if

theres  any  way  that  there  could  be  um

secured  you  know  so  you  dont  have  to

worry  about  getting  your  stuff  broken

into  total  side  random  your  dad  kind  of

thing  I  went  to  the  dead  and  Co  show  and

they  had  a  truck  that  had  um  stored  your

stuff  like  they  searched  it  but  it  was  a

locker  thing  I  dont  know  why  we  cant

do  that  in  the  neighborhood  so  like

people  who  are  traveling  can  put  their

stuff  in  there  and  not  have  to  worry

about  their  car  being  broken  into  that

seems  very  logical  to  me  but

sorry  not  what  we  were  talking  about

dude  Im  just  thriving  no  thats  right

just  the  writing  Community  is  what  like

what  it  looks  like  in  terms  of  resources

in  terms  of  a  driving  Community  as  a

place  that  you  can  get  everything  that

you  need  and  you  feel  safe  that  you  know

that  you  know  not  only  do  you  know  your

beat  cops  not  only  do  you  know  your

police  ambassadors  your  community

ambassadors  but  you  know  your  neighbor

you  know  your  neighbors  name

um  if  you  need  an  egg  you  can  go  you

know  grab  to  the  grocery  store  or  knock

on  your  neighbors  door  like  when  the  89

earthquake  happened  and  I  was  in  the

Richmond  District  everyone  came  out  in

the  street  and  we  all  like  had  our

gassed  up  like  our  little  campfire

stoves  and  we  all  cooked  for  each  other

you  know  my  dad  wasnt  located  for  like

eight  hours  and  the  neighbors  made  sure

our  gas  was  turned  off  like  they  made

sure  we  were  taken  care  of  so

San  Francisco  has  always  had  this

community  but  its  also  people  that

one  thing  I  find  is  very  hurtful  to  our

current  Community  is  this  idea  of  Im

just  going  to  complain  but  Im  not  going

to  do  anything  so  my  new  thing  is  that

Im  not  listening  to  you  complaining

unless  youre  doing  some  some  something

and  anyone  that  can  leave  more  than  two

comments  on  a  social  media  post  we

probably  shouldnt  listen  to  because

they  have  way  too  much  time  on  their

hands  and  they  should  be  going  doing

something  I  think  thats  my  most

frustrating  that  I  think  like  certain

communities  lack  is  like  go  do  it  like

someones  not  safe  walking  home  go  walk

them  home  you  know  youre  outside  is

dirty  do  go  clean  it  like  we  cannot  we

are  a  city

theres  a  lot  of  stuff  going  on  we  have

to  do  our  part  so  I  think  my  idea  of  a

thriving  Community  is  when  everyone  in

the  community  does  their  part

obviously  the  people  that  like  have  a

lot  of  money  are  not  vulnerable  to

affordable  housing  but  they  not  might

not  feel  safe  in  their  housing  which  I

think  is  an  issue  too  you  know  I  think

anyone  that  lives  paycheck  to  paycheck

anyone  that  is

anyone  that  feels  vulnerable  is

vulnerable  you  know  you  cant  take  away

someones  feelings  whether  you  think

like  they  dont  deserve  that  I  know  an

issue  that  I  deal  with  a  lot  is  that  you

know  we  provide  vouchers  or  housing  for

employee  or  for  people  here  in  the  city

and  like  with  my  non-profit  Im  trying

to  get  these  girls  like

head  and  if  they  make  too  much  money

they  lose  their  housing  thats  messed  up

were  keeping  people  down  like  I  cannot

I  dont  understand  that  so  she  cant

work  more  because  then  she  loses  her

housing  but  the  housings  not  really

that  good  so  she  doesnt  want  to  work

more  because  theres  like  rats  in  it  and

her  like  peoples  like  thats  not  a  good

house  for  her  especially  when  shes  a

recovering  addict  like  she  shouldnt  be

there  she  shouldnt  be  in  that  location

but  thats  the  only  house  that  we  can

give  her  but  if  she  tries  to  do  better

she  loses  that  there  is  something  messed

up  in  that  whole  scenario  that  is  really

you  know  I  am  dealing  with  a  non-profit

who  houses  women  coming  out  of  prison

and  they  dont  want  to  work  with  me

anymore  because  Im  getting  them  out  of

that  house  too  quickly  and  theyre

losing  some  of  their  funding  so  theres

theres  something  wrong  thats  like

way  bigger  that  needs  to  be  fixed  as  far

as  budgeting  and  how  we  allocate  money

and  who  we  allocate  the  money  to  and

like  if  someone  qualifies  for  affordable

housing  do  we  really  need  to  make  sure

that  they  continually  like  because  if

theyre  going  to  be  able  to  move  out

they  probably  want  to  move  out  a

millionaire  is  not  going  to  try  to  live

in  affordable  housing  and  if  they  do

props  you  know  like  I  just  dont

understand  why  we  have  to  make  someones

like  stay  in  a  certain  bracket  for

affordable  housing  that  makes  absolutely

no  sense  to  me  like  if  theyre  in  it  and

they  need  help  they  need  help

help  them  but  dont  force  them  to  stay

at  an  income  level  to  keep  this  housing

that  seems  ridiculous  to  me  and  I  dont

think  I  think  if  we  allowed  the  people

who  are  in  the  affordable  housing  to

stay  in  affordable  housing  and  still

build  a  better  income  bracket  the

like  actual  affordable  housing  might

become  better  because  these  people  would

have  money  to  actually  put  into  their

house  to  improve  it  or  their  living

situation  to  improve  it  and  who  wouldnt

want  to  do  that  I  mean  look  at  us  as

humans  we  want

to be  comfortable  you  know  why  not  help

people  do  that

its  ridiculous  you  shouldnt  have  to

you  know  what  I  am  sure  that  it  wants

youre  in  a  spot  where  you  can  move  out

you  will  move  out  exactly  yeah  and  I

mean  its  not  wire  we  keep  on  like  I

just  cant  I  dont

or  you  know  if  um  a  family  of  an

incarcerated  person  is  in  Section  8

Housing  and  the  person  gets  out  of  jail

if  they  want  to  go  see  their  family  it

actually  violates  the  parole  and  they

lose  the  Section  8  housing  as  well  its

really  dumb

so  like  are  we  just  supposed  to  keep

families  like  that  doesnt  even  make

sense  to  me

I  understand  if  they  need  to  maybe  move

to  a  different  Section  8  housing  that

has  a  different  Schnoodle  schwarf  with

the  snorf  you  know  that  I  get  but  to

just  lose  housing  because  you  want  to

see  someone  that  you  havent  seen  in  the

while  is  not  good

well  I  would  say  the  Outer  Sunset  but

you  probably  have  some  long  termers  that

are  gonna  be  like  oh  you  know  so  you

have  to  like  do  it  slow  like  that  idea

of  taking  a  house  and  turning  it  into

like  four  like  I  think  that  would  be

more  like  people  in  the  sunset  would

take  that  better  because  they  like  big

things  freak  them  out  you  know  what  I

mean  they  used  to  be  able  to  see  stuff

so  you  dont  want  to  mess  that  up  for

them

um  I  really  dont  know  why  we  are  just

letting  Union  Square  sit  the  way  it  has

set  and  we  its  just  like

this  thing  its  just  keep  on  building

and  building  and  I  really  feel  like  I

mean  theres  flowers  there  now  thats

nice  I  cant  theres  so  many  flowers

there  but  um  I  dont  understand  why

were  not  housing  people  I  dont

understand  why  okay  the  Hilton  closed

great  dont  we  have  monies  from  like

propsy  to  like  buy  a  bunch  of  stuff  like

why  cant  we  buy  that  you  know  and  I

mean  why  cant  we  House  people  cant  we

declare  a  state  of  emergency  on  housing

and  like  do  a  bunch  of  stuff  without

like  a  like

Im  pretty  sure  we  can  do  that  I  might

not  be  correct  but  we  can  do  something

like  that  where  we  can  actually  House

people  you  know  why  are  we  not  housing

our  police  Cadets

you  know  why  are  we  not  housing  our

teeth  our  teachers  or  our  social  workers

these  just  all  are  things  that  dont

make  sense  especially  because  we

actually  have  that  capability  now  as  a

city  with  all  the  empty  offices  all  the

empty  hotels  and  lets  be  frankincense

and  theres  something  like  500  million

dollars  in  empty  real  estate  that  like

its  just  empty  here  like  yeah  its

ridiculous  so  I  really  dont  understand

why  were  just  not  declaring  an

emergency  and  doing  stuff  it  seems  like

theres  a  lot  of

and  not  a  lot  of  action  and  Im  frankly

over  but  not  a  lot  of  action  I  mean  and

if  I  can  do  it  as  a  tie-dye  shop  owner

then  like  why  cant  the  city  do  it

because  like  I  own  a  tie-dye  shop  its

ridiculous

do  I  have  any  other  community  services

that  I  would  like  to  see  in  San

Francisco  first  of  all  we  need  more

trash  cans  and  we  need  like  a  leaf

blower  like  I  am  a  nature  girl  I  had  the

friends  of  urban  forests  do  my  sidewalk

Schnoodle  snore  but  like  theres  a  lot

of  leaves  on  this  street  and  like

everywhere  and  its  like  it  needs  we

need  to  be  a  cleaner  as  a  city  if  were

trying  to  attract  the  tourists  thats

been  like  10  million  bucks  an  hour  and

tax  revenue  inside  the  city  like  we  need

a  nice  city  we  need  it  to  look  good  we

need  more  bathrooms  the  fact  that  we

have  the  Buena  Vista  bathrooms  that

arent  24  hours  a  day  I  literally  hosed

off  my  shop  before  Pilates  and  came  back

after  Pilates  and  the  guy  was  peeing

like  I  was  like  dude  I  just  chose  and

these  bathrooms  on  Buena  Vista  theyre

not  open  in  the  weekends

like  thats  our  busy  time  why  do  we  not

have  bathrooms  uh  the  idea  of  lockers  to

me  is  imperative  for  being  able  to  curve

car  theft  you  know  just  telling  people

not  to  leave  stuff  in  their  car  thats

not  really  ours  always  an  option  when

youre  driving  somewhere  and  maybe  you

dont  store  everything  but  the  valuables

that  you  dont  want  someone  to  take  you

have  a  safe  spot  to  put  it  you  know  I

really  dont  know  why  we  dont  use  these

vacant  storefronts  for  the  scooter  Char

charging  and  drop  off  because  Im  really

annoyed  that  people  just  leave  scooters

at  random  spots  and

um  you  know  a  lot  of  times  they  block

the  handicap  accessible  thing  for  people

to  go  on  the  sidewalk  and  thats  not

nice  and  I  think  condensing  it  and

making  the  sidewalk  more  clear  would  be

imperative

um  us  and  the  hate  we  had  the  camp  the

um

the  tents  and  I  know  that  was  like  a

ridiculous  amount  of  money  and  that  goes

back  to  the  whole  like  theres  just

money  being  wasted  on  stuff  that  no

people  arent  really  double  checking

um  but  Camp  was  really  good  for  us  as

the  hate  you  know  we  have  one  woman  that

anyone  whos  in  the  hate  knows  me

um  and  um you  know  she  used  to  be  a

model  on  Vogue  magazine  and  she  is  just

I  dont  know  if  Im  allowed  to  swear  on

this  too  too  just  a  Sunday  like  she  is

gone  and  its  an  issue  every  day  you

know  Ill  see  her  lying  in  the  middle  of

the  road  crying  and  like  its  just  and

its  not  we  shouldnt  see  that  she

shouldnt  be  there  like  its  just  and

when  we  had  Camp  I  didnt  see  her  for

eight  months  she  didnt  leave

so  while  its  not  it  definitely  worked

for  some  people  is  it  a  overall  solution

no  are  there  a  few  people  that  it  works

for  that  cant  be  inside  but  do  need  a

safe  spot  to  go  yes  did  it  definitely

clear  up  some  of  our  Corners  here  in  the

street  yes

so  do  I  think  its  a  long-term  awesome

solution  no  is  it  like  a  point  where

maybe  we  can  House  people  that  need  to

get  housed  and  then  maybe  we  can  just

you  know  but  maybe  some  people  are  more

comfortable  there  because  when  youre

dealing  with  chronic  homeless

sometimes  like  after  20  years  people  are

comfortable  there  thats  why  Im  so

adamant  about  working  with  the  youth

because  I

understand  that  in  my  lifetime  we  might

not  end  the  homelessness  crisis  but  I

really  truly  pray  that  we  can  create  a

generation  that  solves  these  issues  and

part  of  that  is  housing  that  generation

but  I  I  think  helping  sustain  San

Francisco  San  Francisco  is  really

supporting  the  small  businesses  in  the

community  because  Ive  seen  a  lot  of  big

businesses  come  and  they  go

theyll  sign  a  five-year  lease  they  get

some  tax  breaks  all  that  stuff  happens

they  cause  a  bunch  of  and  they  leave

were  still  here  were  not  going

anywhere  and  I  think  supporting

communities  is  imperative

whats  so  amazing  about  San  Francisco  is

that  you  can  be  whoever  you  want  to  be

as  I  feel  as  long  as  youre  good  youre

good  in  the  city  and  I  think  its  just

this  really

beautiful  thing  so  I  just  hope  that  the

Magic

the  beat  the  historical  side  of  San

Francisco  Cisco  stays  but  I  also

acknowledge  that  evolution  is  key  whats

really  nice  about  evolution  is  that  you

get  to  keep  the  things  that  you  want  to

keep  and  you  get  to  let  go  of  the  things

that  you  want  to  let  go  of
