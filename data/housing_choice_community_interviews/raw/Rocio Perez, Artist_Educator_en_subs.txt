yeah  so  my  name  is  Rocio  Perez  Im  born

and  raised  here  in  San  Francisco

um  a  little  bit  about  myself  I  work  in

education  Ive  been  working  in  education

for  the  last  13  years  in  various

capacities

recently  graduated  and  will  be  starting

an  actual  like  going  into  my  career  path

as  counseling  or  within  that  realm  of

work  at  the  high  school  level

so  I  work  with  a  lot  of  different

mediums  uh  more  recently  Ive  been

working  with  more  of  like  the

photography  aspect  but  I  do  a  lot  of

painting  I  also  like  create  like  merch

and  clothing  but  like  I  said  Ive  been

honing  in  a  lot  more  on  photography  and

focusing  mainly  on

film  as  well  as  digital

a  lot  of  my  work  is  just  really  Im

inspired  by  everything  around  me  like

where  I  grew  up  like  who  Ive  been

around  like  Ive  been  blessed  to  be

around  like  a  lot  of  like  diverse

individuals  Growing  Up  So  culture  to  me

like  resonates  a  lot  and  being  able  to

like

show  like  a  nostalgic  feeling  of  San

Francisco  or  like  old  Frisco  is  what  I

would  say  is  like  something  that  I

really  like  to  capture  when  I  do

photography  I  dont  do  a  lot  of  like  the

posing  or  the  portrait  shootings  not

that  I  dont  like  it  I  dont  know  it  too

well  but  a  lot  of  my  style  is  just  very

in  the  essence  of  what  individuals  are

doing  to  capture  like  that  very  moment

and  kind  of  storytell  a  little  bit

for  me  personally  like  my  housing  story

I  feel  like  its  always  been  a  little

bit

um

I  feel  like  its  always  been  a  little

bit  different  in  comparison  to  whether

its  people  I  grew  up  with  or  my  family

like  Ive  been  fortunate  enough  to

not  like  have  this  like  challenging

struggle  with  housing  and  it  comes  from

like  my  moms  like  background  and  like

the  work  she  put  in  and  like  being  able

to  like  work  and  be  successful  but

I  have  seen  a  lot  of  shifts  with  housing

within  like  friends  within  my  immediate

family  Ive  seen  a  lot  of  displacement

but  then  close  people  in  my  family

um

I  think  its  changed  a  lot  over  the

years  and  its  gotten  a  lot  more

survival  of  the  fittest  is  what  I  would

kind  of  say  and  its  kind  of  hard  to

like

its  hard  to  navigate  it  even  me  like  if

I  wasnt  in  the  situation  so  I  do  live

in  a  home  right  now  its  my  familys

home  but  I  rent  to  them  Im  not  paying

market  value  I  have  friends  that  live

with  me  and  my  mom  was  like  Im  not

going  to  charge  you  guys  market  value

like  I  want  to  make  it  fair  because  its

crazy  out  there  so  shes  like  as  long  as

the  mortgage  is  being  paid  Ill  like

charge  you  guys  like  the  cheapest  rent

so  Im  very  appreciative  of  that  and

likewise  with  like  the  individuals  I

chose  to  like  move  in  with  me  as  well

um  yeah  so  for  me  personally  I  always

say  if  I  wasnt  in  the  situation  I  was

in  I  wouldnt  be  able  to  do  a  lot  of

things  like  for  example  completing  my

schooling  I  I  would  no  way  be  able  to

afford  living  in  San  Francisco  and

attending  the  university  I  attended  like

that  would  be  completely  out  of  reach

even  then  like  Im  in  debt  right  now

like  I  paid  it  myself  but  given  the

circumstances  and  like  the  situations

that  are  laid  out  but

I  feel  like  affordable  like  its  also  it

comes  down  to  like

the  big  gap  theres  gaps  like  with  like

income  like  the  numbers  are  crazy  like

what  you  have  to  be  making  in  San

Francisco  to  afford  to  be  known  as  like

the  median  is  adult  its  like  its  so

mind-blowing  to  me  and  like  like  I  said

I  work  in  education  so  a  lot  of  families

that  I  work  with  are  more  marginalized

communities  low  income  and  I  see  like

multiple  families  living  in  like  one  or

two  bedrooms  and  its  not  that  theyre

not  working  theyre  all  working  theyre

all  busting  their  asses  but  its  just

very  challenging  to  be  like  me  like  what

that  minimum  is  and  like  I  feel  like

this  I  feel  like  the  average  salary  here

to  be  successful  and  actually  pay  rent

you  have  to  be  making  at  least  over  85

to  100K

so  its  like  hard  when  people  are  making

like  minimum  wage  making  like  50k  a  year

and  its  not  that  theyre  not  doing

anything  its  just  really  hard  to  do  it

out  here

um  that  also  goes  with  like  family  close

friends  Ive  had  a  lot  of  friends  that

have  been  displaced  over  the  years  like

continuously

just  like

in  the  last  I  would  say  like  last  10

years

close  friends  of  mine  have  like  had  to

move  out  because  like  theyre  redoing

the  whole  property  theyre  gonna  face

lift  it  even  though  theyve  been  there

15  18  years  theyre  gonna  like  flip  it

to  charge  more  and  they  cant  afford

that  so  then  they  kind  of  move  to  the

next  best  place  for  them

yeah  I  think  having  more  affordable

housing  is  beneficial  for  our  community

in  the  city  but  I  think  we  also  have  to

think  of  like  there  are  a  lot  of  like

housing  opportunities  right  now  but  is

it  accessible  to  everybody  theres  a  lot

of  spaces  that  are  empty  like  theres  a

lot  of  building  going  on  but  its  like

is  it  being  filled  in

um  like  I  said  I  grew  up  in  the

Excelsior  right  now  right  by  me  off  the

ocean

theres  three  different  properties  going

up  theres  about  to  be  almost  275  units

and  my  question  is  like  oh  thats  cool

because  its  a  very  residential  family

oriented  neighborhood  still  but  like  are

these  individuals  going  to  be  able  to

afford  whats  like  being  placed  there

and  I  know  theres  like  a  balance  of

like  percentage  of  this  goes  to  like

affordable  housing  and  then  it  kind  of

hits  like  this  certain  like  medium  that

you  have  to  make  and  its  just  like  what

kind  of  happens  like  in  between  that  so

I  think  thats  what  kind  of  like  kind  of

not  concerns  me  but  it  does  concern  me

in  a  way  where  its  just  like  yes  its

being  placed  there  but  can  the  people

that  live  there  afford  whats  being

placed  there  I  think  thats  like  what  I

think  about  but  I  think  affordable

housing  in  general  would  be  beneficial

as  long  as  like  people  have  access  to  it

I  would  have  to  say  like  the  most

vulnerable  is  always  like  the  most

marginalized  communities  and  it  tends  to

be  like  more  of  black  and  brown  folks  or

people  of  color  newcomers  coming  from

different  countries

um  I  always  revert  back  to  education

because  I  see  it  in  my  everyday  work

um

marginalized  communities  definitely  get

pushed  to  the  side  and  you  can  kind  of

notice  it  when  you  map  out  San  Francisco

and  you  see  what  they  have  access  to

like

for  example  like  if  we  look  at  the  Bay

View  like  Hunters  Point  like  thats

like  kind  of  push  to  the  skirts  you

dont  really  have  many  grocery  stores

around  there  so  its  like

lack  of  access  to  Transportation  like

you  have  transportation  but  its  like

you  dont  have  Bart  nearby  a  lot  of  the

schools  arent  there  so  everyone

communion  has  to  commute  at  least  an

hour

so  yeah  I  would  definitely  say  like  the

more  marginalized  communities  in  San

Francisco

Ive  worked  with  students  that  might  not

be  getting  the  best  sleep  or  theyre

like  they  have  a  home  and  they  have  a

roof  over  their  head  and  like  theyre

doing  well  they  have  food  on  their  table

but  its  like  its  its  noisy  theres  a

lot  of  people  that  theyre  living  with

or  they  have  more  family  thats  coming

in  they  want  to  be  able  to  support  and

get  them  started  so  it  kind  of  impacts

like  just  like  your  everyday  routine  of

like  essential  things  you  need  like

getting  good  sleep  like  waking  up  on

time  getting  your  homework  done  like

those  are  all  things  that  you  need  to

kind  of  keep  going

instantly  I  would  think  like  the  mission

has  a  lot  of  access  to  things  but  when

you  really  dive  deep  into  it  it  still

has  its  barriers  too  like  it  lacks  a  lot

of  things  as  much  as  its  like  a  hub  of

like  where  people  want  to  live  and  it

has  access  to  lots  of  transportation  and

I  think  in  general  SF  has  really  good

options  for  public  transportation  but

then  when  you  start  to  like  dive  into

like  whats  also  around  like  is  there

parks  around  are  there  like  grocery

stores  how  many  grocery  stores  are

around  the  area

schools  I  feel  like  Noe  Valley  always

comes  to  mind  I  feel  like  its  a  quaint

neighborhood  like  close  to  everything

like  in  the  mix  but  still  to  the  side

and  its  like  it  has  a  lot  of  resources

available  around  them  public

transportation  theres  several  schools

um

I  even  were  like  even  where  I  live  I

feel  like  the  Excelsior  the  outer

Mission  still  has  a  lot  to  it  and  its

still  like  a  very  homey  feel  and  very

residential  it  has  several  families

several  schools  in  the  area  from  like

Pre-K  all  the  way  through  High  School

um  yeah  so  those  are  two  like

neighborhoods  that  come  to  mind  that  do

have  a  lot  of  like  Noe  Valley  definitely

has  a  lot  of  access  to  a  lot

there  is  a  lot  of  changes  how  you  said

like  from  The  Fillmore  just  Patrol  Hill

like  you  literally  cross  the  street  and

its  like  you  have  two  million  dollar

homes  and  its  just  like  you  also  have

like

the  projects  are  still  there  so  its

just  like  how  the  heck  do  you  find  a

balance  in  that

um

I  dont  know  its  interesting  because  I

feel  like  there  still  are  like  its  not

to  say  that  the  sunset  isnt  like  a

marginalized  community  in  itself  either

but  its  interesting  that  like

everything  is  like  built  on  one  side  of

the  city  and  not  the  other

then  I  started  to  think  like  I  was  like

you  dont  see  housing  being  built  in  the

marina  affordable  housing  Im  sure  there

would  be  a  petition  if  anybody  dared  to

build  affordable  housing  in  that

neighborhood  because  it  would  drop  like

the  rates  of  their  value  of  their  homes

um  I  dont  know  I  feel  like  theres  like

I  always  say  theres  two  sides  to  the

story  there  can  be  a  lot  of  Pros  to  it

and  then  it  also  comes  with  a  lot  of

backlash  as  well  just  like  anything

um  but  at  the  end  of  the  day  I  feel  like

being  able  to  build  its  also  like

people  want  to  be  in  certain  parts  of

the  city  like  right  now  like  if  you  were

to  build  on  this  side  like  how  its

continuously  happening  you  have  a  lot  of

like  families  that  send  their  kids  to

certain  schools  or  you  kind  of  have

people  that  finesse  the  system  like  well

Im  gonna  live  here  but  my  kids  gonna

go  completely  on  the  opposite  side  of

the  city  to  go  to  school  to  get  a  better

education

um  so  I  feel  like  there  really  are  a  lot

of  pros  and  cons  to  that

I  would  instantly  think  of

um  translation  because  you  dont  know

whos  really  going  to  move  in  I  feel

like  you  can  have  all  the  resources  in

the  world

and  if  people  can  have  access  to  it  but

if  they  dont  know  how  to  navigate  it  it

kind  of  just  sits  there  which  happens  a

lot  I  feel  like  in  San  Francisco  too

like  if  you  dont  speak  the  language  and

you  dont  understand  like  even  if  its

like  you  speak  English  you  might  not

understand  like  the  way  things  are

written  its  confusing  and  its

intimidating  so  I  feel  like  being  able

to  have  like  language  support  and  access

to  that  I  feel  like  community  centers

outdoor  racks  I  feel  like  grocery  stores

just  access  to  a  lot  of  like  your

essential  needs

um  I  always  think  of  like  students  just

because  of  the  work  that  I  do  so  it

could  be  schools  it  could  be  like  actual

outdoor  things  for  them  to  do  like

access  to  like  I  dont  know  like  bowling

alleys  like  just  things  to  do  like  to

keep  you  busy  that  its  not  just  like

you  got  to  figure  out  what  youre  going

to  do  on  your  own

um yeah  it  can  vary  I  feel  like

community  centers  can  stem  with  like  a

lot  of  different  things  and  it  can  grow

into  like  leadership  like  usually  like

people  that  have  access  to  community

centers  that  they  feel  connected  to

theyll  usually  go  to  them  for  support

so  that  kind  of  Builds  on  its  own  so  I

think  like

all  those  things  are  like  essential

within  certain  communities  in  San

Francisco  or  if  I  were  to  build  like  my

own  Community  I  feel  like  just  a  lot  of

those  things  that  revolve  around

education  and  being  able  to  like  help

those  around  you  so  that  you  can  be  able

to  move  forward

I  know  I  had  mentioned  earlier  I  feel

like

resources  is  really  important  but  being

able  to  also  provide  like  additional

help  to  those  resources  like  what  do  I

do  with  these  resources  that  are

available  to  me  like  how  can  I  use  that

because  sometimes  theres  people  that

have  no  idea  like  what  certain  housing

that  happens  that  they  can  even  afford

to  live  there  they  see  it  they  see  its

a  new  building  a  new  structure  it  looks

real  nice  and  instantly  you  think  money

and  then  some  people  dont  know  that

there  might  be  access  to  affordable

housing  there  so  then  they  dont  even

bother  so  its  kind  of  having  to  wheel

in  certain  you  have  to  go  to  certain

communities  you  cant  just  assume

everyone  knows  whats  there  so  its  like

you  got  to  go  to  the  individuals  that

actually  live  there  and  offer  them  like

hey  like  theres  this  available

thats  where  like  language  barriers  like

if  you  want  to  talk  to  someone  like

theres  these  phones  phone  numbers  that

you  can  access  for  like  specific

languages  so  I  think  thats  like  a  big

thing  too  like  we  have  so  many  different

types  of  people  that  live  in  San

Francisco  its  like  its  a  Melting  Pot

or  at  least  it  was  for  the  longest  that

it  still  is  but  its  just  some  Melting

Pot  of  so  many  different  cultures  so  it

comes  with  so  many  different  languages

what  makes  the  Excel  sphere  where  I  grew

up  what  it  is  and  like  for  me  like  the

first  few  things  that  come  to  mind  is

like  its  generational  like  my

grandparents  didnt  initially  when  they

moved  here  they  didnt  live  there  they

lived  in  the  intermission  but  then  they

finally  decided  to  settle  down  and  the

Excelsior  which  their  house  is  still

there  that  my  family  lives  at

um  and  then  my  mom  was  able  to  buy  in

that  area  and  Im  still  in  that  same

neighborhood  and  like

it  feels  good  to  be  back  like  where  your

roots  are  planted  like  you  like  that  and

its  just  like  theres  its  such  a  still

like

a  family  neighborhood  like  its  still

very  residential

you  see  Mom  and  Pop  shops  and  when  I  say

Mom  and  Pop  shops  like  shops  that  have

been  there  since  like  the  60s  that  are

still  at  it  like  Central  drugstore  right

on  the  corner  of  mission  and  uh

Mission  and  Excelsior  like  thats  been

around  for  years  and  people  still  go

there  like  theres

even  if  its  younger  older  folks  that  go

there  like  theyre  still  going  there  to

support  the  business  to  make  sure  that

its  still  thriving  and  its  still  going

um

yes  its  nice  to  see  like  new  businesses

come  in  but  you  want  new  businesses  to

come  in  with  the  right  intention  you

want  them  like  for  example  I  will  like

promote  like  Excelsior  coffee  like  they

came  in  with  the  right  intentions  made

this  very  cute  aesthetically  pleasing

like  coffee  shop  that  theres  several

like  little  coffee  shops  which  are  still

people  go  to  but  theyre  still  catering

to  the  neighborhood  they  throw  community

events  family  events  so  they  throw

things  for  the  community  so  its  not

like  theyre  coming  to  take  over  and

remove  something  they  want  to  add  to  it

so  like  businesses  like  that  I  think  are

very  beneficial

and  then  just  speaking  of  different

properties  and  like  stuff  around  there

like

the  ocean  and  Mission  Walgreens  has  been

closed  for  a  little  bit  and  I  always

wonder  like  well  what  are  they  gonna  put

there  like  its  such  a  family-oriented

neighborhood  like  the  Excelsior  the

outer  Mission  you  even  get  people  like

that  live  like  Portola  because  its  just

right  over  the  hill  like  you  got  the

baby  over  the  hill  as  well  now  I  always

wondering  I  joke  around  Im  like  they

should  put  like  either  like  a  small

bowling  alley  or  like  something  that

students  have  access  to  because  yes  we

have  parks  and  the  skate  parks  but  we

dont  have  anything  else  and  back  in  the

day  the  Granada  Theater  was  like  that

was  like  a  movie  theater  there  so  its

like  why  cant  they  bring  in  things  that

families  can  access

um and  then  when  it  comes  to  like

traditions  and  different  things  its

like

like  I  should  so  with  my  photography  I

shoot  a  lot  in  the  Low  Rider  scene  and

like  for  me  when  I  think  of  like  growing

up  I  think  of  like  going  with  my  sister

and  my  niece  like  taking  our  chairs  like

our  lawn  chairs  up  to  Mission  Street

when  the  low  riders  would  be  at  Cow

Palace  for  their  big  car  show  and  they

would  just  cruise  down  Mission  and  we

would  just  sit  there  and  just  watch  it

the  Cars  cruise  by  and  its  all  these

families  sitting  there  with  food  in

their  lawn  chairs  too  and  just  watching

all  that  happen  so  I  could  think  of  a

bunch  of  things  like  that  just  growing

up

I  also  like  met  all  my  closest  friends

in  the  neighborhood  like  once  I  went  to

school  and  started  taking  public

transportation  you  start  to  see  who

lives  in  your  area  like  when  youre

getting  off  at  the  same  bus  stops  and

youre  like  oh  like  you  guys  live  right

here  thats  how  I  realized  I  lived  so

close  like  two  blocks  away  from  like

multiple  friends  in  high  school

um  so  theres  like  a  lot

that  Im  like  tied  into  in  the  excels

here  and  its  like  for  me  those  are  like

my  roots  because  I  think  of  like  just

like  growing  up  and  like

all  the  fun  things  that  have  happened

its  just  like  all  the  people  you

interact  with  like  just  growing  up

honestly

oof  I  feel  like  theres  so  many

different  things  that  make  the  city  like

what  it  is  like  we  recently  like  just

starting  summer  like  Carnival  I  mean

thats  been  around  like  for  years  like  I

was  I  want  to  say  it  was  like  the  45th

year  this  year

like  thats  something  that  like  its

also  generational  like  you  have

my  friends  dancing  it  now  their  kids  are

dancing  in  it  their  parents  dancing  it

Grandparents  like  its  just  like  this

thing  where  it  just  continues  to  keep  on

giving  and  its  like

I  feel  like  that  is  like  a  traditional

event  thats  like  healing  like  it  comes

with  music  it  comes  with  dancing  it

comes  with  the  merging  of  not  just  like

the  Latino  Community  its  like  all

communities  like  the  dancers  that  are  in

it  come  from  like  everywhere  its  not

just  like  one  specific  area

um  yeah  I  can  like  think  of  so  many

different  things  even  with  like

community  events  I  think  just  like

pushing  to  throw  as  like  an  artist  and

someone  who  curates  events  as  well  and

like  immerses  themselves  in  the  like

creative  Community  theres  so  many

people  still  pushing  right  now  that  like

want  the  Arts  to  still  like  be  what

holds  us  together  but  it  can  get

challenging  too  and  like  theres

gatekeeping  like  when  it  comes  to  like

hosting  events  and  like  what  it  costs  to

throw  an  event  or  like  to  rent  a  space

that  gets  a  little  its  disheartening

when  you  want  to  do  something  for  a  good

reason  but  then  you  realize  like  oh  well

theyre  asking  me  for  fifteen  hundred

dollars  to  have  this  space  and  its  just

like  what  kind  of  artists  can  do  that

you  know  Im  sure  you  can  get  people  to

support  but  it  takes  it  takes  a  village

to  really  get  something  going  and

theres  still  people  that  make  it  happen

but

yeah  I  feel  like  a  lot  of  different

things  make  the  city  what  it  is

like  I  mentioned  earlier  like  theres

theres  like  this  Gap  that  I  hope  that

can  eventually  get  filled  in  so  that

everyone  does  have  the  access  and  can

afford  to  live  in  certain  spaces  or  just

to  have  a  space  to  live  in  that  they

call  home  without  feeling  so  like

like  theres  so  many  barriers  around

them  because  I  feel  like  barriers  are

like  the  biggest  things  with  anything  it

doesnt  matter  what  it  is  whether  its

housing  schooling  getting  an  education

on  something  it  doesnt  matter  like  work

barriers  are  like  everywhere  but  I  hope

like  down  the  line  were  able  to  create

a  space  where  like  families  do  have  the

access  to  like  live  somewhere  and  be

able  to  raise  their  kids  somewhere  or

their  their  parents  take  care  of  their

parents  and  make  sure  that  theyre  not

taken  out  of  like  their  own  homes

because  thats  also  very  like

disheartening  to  see  like  happen

continuously  like  as  you  mentioned  like

youve  been  here  for  generations  and

your  family  has  like  it  would  be

disheartening  if  you  found  out  like  they

were  going  to  do  something  and  build  and

all  of  a  sudden  like  what  youve  called

home  is  no  longer  home
