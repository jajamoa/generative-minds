hi  my  name  is  Jason  I  just  graduated

from  Washington  High  School  Im  going  to

be  going  to  UC  Berkeley  for

environmental  engineering

and  I  live  in  the  outer  mission

my  name  is  Kelly  I  also  live  in  the  Auto

mission  and  Im  currently  a  senior  at

Galleria

hi  my  name  is  Jackie  I  was  born  and

raised  in  the  Bay  View  along  the  borders

of  like  District  9  and  10.  so  Im  not

too  far  into  the  beefy  though  and  I  am

entering  my  senior  year  at  Lowell  High

School

Tracy  and  most  of  my  family  is

physically  from  The  Bayview  District

more  towards  like  mission

I  live  in  the  outer  Mission  and  its

primarily  like  a  single  family  homes

around  my  area

towards  alimony  which  is  a  busier  Street

theres  started  to  be  more  apartment

buildings  popping  up  and  by  Balboa  Park

theres  been  one  more  and  the  business

districts  on  Mission  and  Geneva  a  lot  of

the  businesses  have  are  the  same  ones

from  like  10  years  ago  so  theyve  been

doing  well  and  transportation  those  same

bus  lines  have  been  around  so  not  much

change  in  my  neighborhood

I  can  kind  of  go  after  that  so  um but  my

parents  like  first  immigrated  here  from

China  they  bought  a  house  in  Emeryville

its  across  the  bay  bridge  its  in

Oakland  and  so  after  that  they  actually

ended  up  selling  it  and  moving  to  the

Excelsior  District  which  is  really  close

to  where  I  live  now

um  I  live  in  the  outer  Mission  but  Ive

noticed  that  like  in  the  time  living

there  Ive  kind  of  noticed  theres  a  lot

more  like  affordable  housing  being  built

up  there  are  a  lot  of  like  unused  Lots

before  like  ones  like  close  to  the

Safeway  there  and  stuff  like  that  but

now  theyre  getting  actually  repurposed

and  getting  built  into  housing  units

which  has  really  nice  to  see

um  for  me  like  I  said  I  was  born  and

raised  in  Bayview  and  thats  where  Ive

seen  a  lot  of  housing  develop  in  our

city  I  know  most  of  its  been  on  the

east  side  of  the  city  and  thats  where

the  Bay  View  is

um Ive  lived  primarily  in  like  one  or

two  homes  in  the  babies  that  havent

moved  often

uh  and  most  of  the  or  I  guess  its  a  mix

of  taller  buildings  and  also  um single

family  homes  in  the  Bayview  and  I  think

especially  in  like  the  silver  tirins

area  weve  seen  a  lot  of  development

weve  seen  taller  buildings

um  and  in  the  Hunters  Point  area  too

theres  a  lot  of  development  there  and

in  terms  of  the  businesses  in  the  area  I

think  Ive  seen  businesses  come  and  go

whether  theyre  supermarkets  theres  ice

cream  shops  so  I  think

um  theres  its  a  mix  theres  also  ones

that  have  been  in  the  neighborhood  for  a

while  and  that  continued  to  be  continue

to  be  doing  really  well

um yeah  I  kind  of  agree  with  Jackie

theres  living  a  lot  of  like

um

construction  and  more  apartments  and

affordable  housing  in  the  Hunters  Point

area  and  in  Bayview  I  see  that  there

will  across  the  street  from  my  Grandmas

house  they  did  build  a  new  like  a

Maltese  industrial  building  so  I  feel

like  they  maybe  do  need  to  have  a  little

bit  more  housing  but  other  than  that

its  um  a  good

um  housing

oh  yeah  so  my  family  before  I  was  born

they  were  living  in  like  North  Beach

area  they  were  renting  a  very  small  area

with  my  grandparents  so  super  cramped

and  then  uh

they  moved  over  to  the  outer  mission

where  I  live  now  and  then  I  was  born  so

I  wasnt  able  to  experience  that  so  I

cant  speak  much  about  that

yeah  I  kind  of  like  add  on  to  my  like

whole  thing  so  my  I  think  my  grandpa  and

my  grandma  have  actually  immigrated  here

like  earlier  on  and  so  it  was  during

kind  of  like  I  dont  know  the  time  where

a  lot  of  people  immigrated  over  like  on

the  ships  and  stuff  like  that  no

complains  nothing  like  that  but  they

made  it  here  earlier  on  and  then  they

kind  of  settled  in  the  Chinatown  area

where  a  lot  of  Chinese  immigrants  did  at

that  time  and  they  took  up  a  few  like

random  jobs  here  and  there  but  they

worked  really  hard  and  so  using  like

some  of  that  money  they  were  able  to

fund  it  down  to  my  dad  where  we  actually

got  a  house  in  the  Emeryville  area

Im  actually  pretty  similar  to  Kellys

story  my  parents  also  immigrated  here

um a  few  decades  ago  and  I  guess  would

primarily  drill  in  the  San  Francisco  is

probably  like  the  culture  similar  to

what  Kelly  said  once  again  just  like

having

um such  strong

um  cultural  neighborhoods  like  Chinatown

for  example

um that  really  attracted  them  here

especially  as

um  newly  arrived  immigrants  and

um I  know  um on  my  mothers  side  at

least  um  she  started  Living  on  Gary

Boulevard  along  the  um  that  area

um  like  in  the  Richmond  area

but  over  time  Ive  noticed  that  most  of

my  family  have  moved  to  like  the  Bay

View  to

um  to  district  10  like  this  area  with

like  the  station  Valley  too  yeah  because

these  houses  are  like  more  affordable

um  I  before  my  mom  used  to  live  in  San

Francisco  she  lived  there  like  most  of

her  life  and  then  I  was  born  in  Castro

Valley  I  stayed  in  the  East  Bay

um  and  then  I  moved  to

um Hayward  and  then  I  spent  most  of  my

time  there  and  then  I  just  kept  like

moving  further  out  but  my  family  always

stayed  in  in  San  Francisco  so  I  was

always  visiting  like  especially  like

multiple  times  a  month  and

um  yeah

actually  that  was  probably  the  reason

why  I  would  move  further  out  because  it

kept  getting  more  and  more  expensive  and

my  mom  moved  away  from  San  Francisco  too

um  and  yeah  so  I  think  the  price  is  like

really

increasing  a  lot

yeah  I  definitely  agree

um  and  I  think  like  I  said  before

um  I  feel  like  the  prices  increase  like

its  not  uh  proportional  like  every

neighborhood  um doesnt  increase  at  the

same  rate  so  we  have  some  neighborhoods

that  are

um  that  have  housing  prices  that  are  way

higher  than  others  and  thats  why  most

of  my  family  at  least  that  have  stayed

in  San  Francisco  they  have  moved  to  like

cheaper  or  like  more  affordable

neighborhoods  like  the  Bayview  and

physician  Valley  but  I  also  have  family

members  who  have  left  the  city  for

um  for  other  cities  around  the  bay  area

area  whether  thats

um  San  Mateo  or

or  um  San  Bruno  and  also  a  family  whove

moved  further  further  out  east  like

Sacramento

and  Ive  also  seen  teachers  Ive  also

seen  other  neighbors  who  have  moved  and

relocated  because  its  been  because

housing  prices  have  Rose  so  much

are  you  kind  of  like  Ill  get  on  to  that

for  my  own  like  personal  experiences  and

so  like  I  said  earlier  my  parents  did  it

ended  up  like  selling  the  house  in

Emeryville  and  they  wanted  to  move  back

into  the  city  because  we  like  our  entire

like  lives  are  kind  of  like  in  the  city

and  so  commuting  across  the  bay  bridge

who  was  really  just  tiring  I  know  its  a

lot  of  driving  for  my  parents  and  so  we

want  to  move  in  but  then  in  the  like  I

guess  time  spent  between  selling  the

house  and  finding  a  new  house  in  SF

thousand  prizes  that  really  rose  up  like

that  was  kind  of  like  way  before  the

pandemic  but  it  was  like  a  time  where

like  a  lot  of  like  middle  class  families

getting  priced  out  of  even  like

neighborhoods  like  the  outer  Mission  or

Bayview  and  so  during  that  time  I  just

kind  of  even  though  I  was  like  really

young  I  was  still  in  like  middle  school

and  stuff  like  that  I  kind  of  saw  the

fact  that  like  so  many  of  these  houses

like  their  prices  were  Rising  but  the

incomes  of  the  families  that  wanted  to

live  in  them  they  werent  Rising  nearly

as  high  and  so  I  kind  of  saw  like  these

houses  go  from  like  even  going  to  open

houses  I  saw  that  like  before  it  was

mainly  like  normal  families  going  there

but  later  on  itd  be  more  like  investors

going  there  and  I  saw  more  like  four  and

like  foreign  investors  like  sending  like

people  out  there  to  the  open  house  and

so  like  even  though  I  was  so  young  I

would  see  like  the  market  in  SF  just  go

crazy  I  guess

uh  yeah  so  my  family  got  our  bought  our

house  in  2003  so  that  was  before  the

economics  uh  got  really  expensive  in  San

Francisco  so  I  think  nowadays  its  like

if  youre  gonna  make  a  down  payment  on  a

house  with  like  a  middle  income  in  your

family  its  like  super  difficult  but

then  back  then  it  was  actually  a

reasonable  choice  so  its  like  making

more  types  of  housing  available  would

really  alleviate  that  uh  burden  of

trying  to  get  a  property  but  not  being

able  to  afford  it  so  like

uh  affordable  housing  some  like  market

rate  and  also  like  uh

the  what  do  you  call  it  the  transitional

housing  for  uh  unhoused  people

um

policy  maybe  like  more

information  like

things

being  posted  around

so  I  can  help  more  people  especially

people  who  are  like  not  on  track  and

everything

I  actually  need  help  and  also

um  I  think  homelessness  is  a  really  big

problem  to  San  Francisco

so  I  think  I  guess  trying  to  help  people

get  off  the  streets  and  also  make  things

a  little  more  affordable  or  at  least

raise  income

um  for  me  I  think

when  I  when  I  heard  the  question  I

mostly  thought  about  public  spaces

public  services

and  personally  I  think  I  found  having

for  example  like  a  public  library  nearby

really  important  having  Open  Spaces  Club

Parks  areas  to  to  just  jog  outside  or

spend  time  outside

um  that  to  be  really  important  too  as

well  as

um

as  well  as  having

um  or  being  close  to  like  a  commercial

Corridor  where  we  have  retail  shops

where  we  have  local  businesses

um  supermarkets

um yeah  I  found  out  to  be  really

important  as  well  and

um

I  think  looking  forward  Id  love  to  see

more  collaboration  with  between

different  city  departments  I  know  San

Francisco  is  a  really  large  city  we  have

a  lot  of  City  departments  and  a  lot  of

them  are  doing  like  really  important

work

um  and  there  are  a  few  that  work

especially  close  with  young  people

um  I  know  like  I  mentioned  like  SF

Public  Library  SF  reckon  Park  our

department  of  children  youth  and  their

families

um  yeah  and  they  have  a  lot  of  like

great  programs  that  aim  to  make  San

Francisco  a  more  livable  place  for  young

people  and  also  make  it  a  place  where

individuals  would  like  to  race  kids  yeah

so  I  think  if  there  was  more

collaboration  between  like  these

different  agencies  and  these  different

departments

um

um  they  could  definitely  yield  better

results  in  the  long  term

yeah  and  then  adding  on  to  what  Jackies

kind  of  saying  about  like  just  like

libraries  and  things  like  that

um Ive  noticed  in  the  outer  Mission

there  isnt  really  like  a  library  here

its  theres  one  like  in  the  Excelsior

but  its  pretty  far  away  from  where  I

live  and  so  I  would  love  to  see  like  the

implementation  of  just  like  a  better

like  community  space  in  my  neighborhood

I  think  also  with  like  the  shared  spaces

program  that  SF  has  and  has  like  popped

up  during  the  epidemic  I  think  its

really  nice  its  actually  moved  that

more  down  like  Southern  to  the  southern

neighborhoods  like  um the  otter  Mission

or  participation  Valley  or  the  Bay  View

I  think  a  lot  of  these  communities  there

is  community  there  but  theres  not  a  big

push  for  it  to  be  actually  shown  and  so

Id  love  for  a  better  like  Initiative

for  more  community  building  in  our

neighborhoods

I  uh  also  in  the  outer  Mission  so  uh  I

grew  I  grew  up  going  to  Cayuga  Park  and

its  like  next  to  the  freeway  so  its

like  at  times  noisy  so  it  might  make

people  not  want  to  go  there  and  then

there  used  to  be  overgrown  like  uh  weeds

and  like  bushes  so  it  was  kind  of  unsafe

in  like  the  hillsides  so  it  deters

people  from  going  there  but  uh  Ive  seen

recently  that  the  gar  there  have  been

two  gardeners  who  have  been  hired  and

theyve  just  been  doing  a  great  job  like

keeping  the  park  clean  and  now  I  feel

like  in  the  morning  uh  I  can  even  I  can

feel  safe  and  theres  a  lot  of  elderly

people  who  are  able  to  like  walk  around

the  circle  and  I  feel  like  they  could  be

safe  too  now

usually  I  would  drive  but  more  recently

Ive  been  like  taking  Bart  and  the  muni

I  really  do  like  the  moon  because  it  is

really  convenient  and  it  does  run  really

frequently

so  awesome

sometimes  yeah

most  of  the  time  it  does  run  pretty

frequently  but  I  do  feel  like  the  BART

should  run  more

because  its  like  every  like  15-20

minutes

um

and  the  bus

um  I  feel  like  they  probably  should  have

a  little  bit  more  buses  because

especially  like

around  where  people  around  the  time

people  get  off  school  and  work  and

everything  is  super  crowded  its  like

probably  and  everything

um

and  but  I  feel  like  San  Francisco

um  does  do  a  good  job  of  like  the

transportation

um  for  me  I  usually  rely  on  public

transit  since  I  live  across  the  city

from  where  I  go  to  school  yeah  so  Im  I

use  public  transit  a  lot  um  mainly  Muni

and  I  also  sometimes  get  driven  too

because

um it  is

um  at  times  hard  to  catch  the  bus  at

like  six  or  seven  in  the  morning  and  it

might  get  crowded

um I  personally  rely  on  like  the  29  for

example  and  I  know  it  goes  from  like  the

baby  all  the  way up  to  all  the  way

through  the  sunset  to  like

um  to  like  Richmond  where  Washington  is

and  theres  a  lot  of  kids  who  rely  on

the  route  and  sometimes  it  is  difficult

to  get  on  a  bus  but  um  I  definitely

agree  with  Ariana  where  I  think

Community  is

um  or  I  guess

to  rephrases  I  think  Muni  is  doing

um  quite  a  good  job  especially  compared

to  like  a  lot  of  other  cities

um if  you  look  at  like  a  Muni  map  where

you  see  that  its  we  have  routes

throughout  the  city  um

and  yeah  were  all  like  connected  to  the

financial  district  downtown  on  the

downtown  area

um  yeah  and

I

like  especially  like  as  someone  who  like

serves  on  their  youth  Transit  Advisory

Board  I  see  that  theyre  making  a  lot  of

progress  too  in  terms  of  trying  to  do

more  Outreach  to  young  people  trying  to

alleviate  some  of  the  issues  that

um  still  exists  on  uni  yeah  but  once

again  like  I  think  theyre  doing  a

pretty  good  job  of  connecting  our  city

um

yeah  and  I  guess  to  speak  on  the  other

side  of  things  I  think  theres  still

definitely  are  issues  that  um  could  be

improved  um  on  with  Muni  in  terms  of

like  reliability  just  getting  more

writers  to

um  ride  Muni  and  in  terms  of  safety  on

Muni

um

yeah  and  I  know  they  also  identified

like  Equity  neighborhoods  where  we  have

like  the  outer  mission  for  example  or

the  Bay  View  for  example  where  theyre

trying  to  Target  for  their  Outreach

efforts  and  for  their  future

improvements  yeah  so  I  think

um  theyre  really  making  progress

um  as  for  me  I  usually  commute  to  and

like  from  school  like  in  the  car  my

parents  usually  drive  me  because  they

also  make  a  long  commute  like  they

usually  like  work  in  like  the  Vanessa

like  around  Vanessa  Street  and  stuff

like  that  but  then  we  literally  live

like  across  the  city  like  the  most  like

southern  end  and  so  usually  his  car  but

in  between  my  day  and  like  after  school

a  lot  of  times  I  am  taking  the  bus  and  I

will  say  like  adding  on  to  Ariana  said

and  Jackie  said  the  bus  system  in  SF  is

like  pretty  Advanced  Ill  be  honest  it

is  pretty  good  its  pretty  solid  and  we

even  have  free  immunity  for  youth  which

is  really  great  a  lot  of  like  cities

across  the  United  States  that  have  that

so  thats  a  great  like  privilege  living

here  but  I  will  say  that  there  are  like

a  lot  of  things  that  could  be  improved

on  like  Ariana  said  the  reality  theyre

not  really  reliable  sometimes  sometimes

like  buses  take  like  I  dont  know  10

minutes  to  come  a  lot  of  times  like  20

minutes  or  they  skip  your  stop  sometimes

which  I  understand  but

um  I  just  think  sometimes  there  are  like

a  lot  of  like  minor  critiques  that  you

could  make  to  the  muni  system  but

overall  it  is  a  pretty  good  system  I

think  if  anything  thing  Id  like  to  talk

more  about  like  riding  bikes  around  the

city  I  think  with  so  many  more  like  bike

Lanes  being  added  and  like  with  JFK

being  closed  now  I  think  thered  be  more

of  like  a  push  for  bikes  I  know  like

theres  like  lift  wheels  and  theres

like  bay  wheels  which  is  um  a  program

that  allows  to  rent  out  bikes  for  like  I

think  minutely  pay  but  I  think  there

should  be  like  a  more  push  for  the  city

to  actually  like  incentivize  these

companies  to  come  in  and  like  make  their

bikes  cheaper  because  I  think  biking

across  the  city  is  a  great  way  to  get  to

like  destinations  but  it  is  really

expensive  for  example  the  other  week  I

rode  for  90  minutes  and  it  was  30

dollars  so  it  was  pretty  bad  but  I  love

biking  and  I  think  biking  should  be  more

affordable  for  all  the  youth  around  our

city  and  also  I  guess  different

neighborhoods  down  our  city

yeah  I  totally  agree  with  you  guys  that

uh  Muni  is  pretty  pretty  good  when  uh  in

America  oh  and  comparing  it  to  like

other  American  cities  a  lot  of  times  the

public  transit  isnt  that  good  so  Im

very  appreciative  that  we  have  the  muni

system  but  yeah  uh  I  noticed  that

getting  to  downtown  like  basically  any

quarter  at  any  uh  part  of  SF  getting  to

downtown  is  pretty  uh  nice  but  then  like

from  my  from  my  experience  in  my  area

like  going  to  the  sunset  or  the  Richmond

uh  I  have  to  catch  the  29  and  it  takes

quite  a  while  and  then  also  like  if  I

want  to  go  to  like  Bayview

um  the  54  or  like  the  44  isnt  as

reliable  so  like  the  ones  that  go  to  the

residential  neighborhoods  arent  that

great  but  its  its  still  possible  and

then  downtown  is  very  nice

right  um  adding  onto  ah  Kellys  about

bike  Lanes  I  definitely  think  theyre

really  important  um yeah  and  honestly

being  completely  honest  I  cant  ride  a

bike

yeah  but  still  I  feel  like  they  are

really  important  and  also  just  like  Open

Spaces  I  know  we  recently  have  our  slow

streets  program  yeah  as  someone  who

cant  bike  but

um  but  uh  yeah  I  could  I  really  do  enjoy

like  the  slow  Shades  um  having  shoots

close  and  just  being  able  to  spend  time

outside  uh  and

yeah  and  as  um  Jason  said

um  the  29  is  pretty  slow  but  I  think

there  is  like  an  improvement  project  on

the  way  but

um I  think  with  anything  related  to  city

government  like  just  like  as  were  in  as

a  planning  to  its  really  slow

um  theres  a  lot  of  bureaucracy  and  I

know  like  looking  on  the  timeline  I

think  its  not  going  to  be  like  fully

completed  for  like  another  like  three  to

five  years  yes  so  I  think  everythings

just  really  slow  and  like

its  not  adapting  to  to  changing

demographics  changing  needs

um  as  quickly  as  needed

I  can  kind  of  start  so  I  went  to  school

at  Marina  middle  school  and  also  I  go  to

Galileo  now  so  its  like  in  that  little

District  where  its  like  kind  of  the

marina  and  I  always  say  that  the  marina

is  so  like  there  are  a  lot  of  like  nice

resources  there  for  the  community

members  but  I  will  say  the  same  type  of

really  like  applicable  to  my

neighborhood  like  for  example  they  have

the  whole  like  Moscone  Park  its  really

nice

um  the  people  that  run  it  are  also

really  nice  theyre  part  of  like  I  think

the  Rex  and  Parks  team  but  I  also  say

their  neighbor  theres  like  libraries

are  really  nice  and  its  really  close  to

the  water  which  is  I  guess  you  cant

really  have  that  in  mind  neighborhood

because  mines  like  Nautica  all  close  to

the  water  but  its  like  the  whole

neighborhood  in  general  just  theres  so

many  like  nice  like  like  I  dont  know

wide  streets  and  theres  like  theres  a

lot  of  like  nice  I  guess  like  trees  and

like  bushes  like  that  where  I  cant  like

say  the  same  thing  for  my  neighborhood

but  I  will  say  that  like  after  like

going  to  school  there  for  so  long  Ive

like  noticed  a  drastic  change  between

the  two  neighborhoods

um  I  could  follow  up  on  that

um I  also  definitely  do  see

um  a  difference  between  different

neighborhoods  in  our  city

um

yeah  like  for  example  like  growing  up  in

the  Bayview  Ive  seen  issues  regarding

like  food  access  I  know  a  lot  of  the

Hunters  Point  area  is  still  considered  a

food  desert  and  weve  had  supermarkets

close  and  but  were  lucky  to  have  the

new  like  lucky  spay  view

um  a  shop  but  so  I  think  once  again  like

a  lot  of  the  Hunters  Point  area  is  still

considered  food  desert  and  we  have

issues  relating  to  like  air  air  quality

for  example  I  know  its  the  same  for

outer  mission  where  were  along  like

major  freeways  like  the  280  or  like  101

yeah  and  that  really  affects  some

neighborhoods  but  not  others  and  in

terms  of  distribution  of  resources  like

for  schools  I  think  that  like  disparity

still  exist  too  for  example  like  I

personally  attended  MLK  Middle  School

before  I  went  to  Louisville  and  Im  okay

is  in  District  nine  its  really  its

like  right  next  to  the  Bayview

um and  while  I  was  a  student  there  Ive

had  the  opportunity  to  serve  in  like

different  leadership  positions  student

gov  and  like  one  example  is  like  the

spirits  I  saw  was  how  we  Face  large

budget  cuts  I  know  um  at  one  point  when

I  was  in  my  effort  year  and  like  serving

a  student  body  President  we  had  I

believe  it  was  like  300  000  for

improvised  cuts  for  our  school  and  it

wasnt  just  Emma  caber  we  also  had

budget  cuts  targeted  School  targeting

schools  throughout  the  southeast  side  of

our  city  we  had  like  James  Denman

um  James  lick  visitation  Valley

and  yeah  I  think  these  are  just  like

examples  of  how  disparities  in  our  city

are  so  deep  rooted  and  its  ingrained  in

like  different  systems  including  our

education  system  including  the

environmental  aspect  of  things  and  also

just  like  other  areas  as  well  okay  add

on  to  Jackie  like  uh  not  just  not  just

like  the  disadvantages  in  the  Southeast

but  like  throughout  all  public  schools

like  sfusd  is  getting  these  like  major

budget  cuts  that  are  not  very  helpful

when  were  trying  to  improve  the

education  of  uh  young  people  so  it  would

help  if  there  could  actually  be  more

funding  because  there  are  so  many

problems  in  schools  that  could  be

improved  with  some  more  funding

and  neighborhoods  that  I  think  have  more

resources  would  be  like  the  west  side

because  theres  um its  less  packed  so  I

and

um  theres  also  better  schools  and  like

more  green  space  whereas  like  um  like

the  northeast  or  like  the  southeast  has

more  like  uh  dense  and  there  tends  to  be

less  of  that  uh  less  resources  I  feel

like

yeah  and  yeah  Im  trying  to  add  anything

I  was  just  gonna  say  maybe  the  Richmond

area  its  like  a

its  pretty  decent  its  nice

yeah  I  was  just  gonna  add  to  what  Jason

said  too  about  how  I  feel  like  when  we

think  of  the  major  schools  in  San

Francisco  or  like  major  high  schools  at

least  um we  often  think  of  Washington

Lowell  Lincoln  Galileo  these  are  all

schools  on  like  the  north  side  of  our

city  or  like  the  west  side  of  our  city

um even  though

um  there  are  like  large  there  are  large

like  youth  populations  and  there  are

other  like  sites  in  our  other  sectors  of

our  city  like  the  South  and  the  east

um  yeah  so  yeah  just  think  there  are

disparities  still  and  like  Jason  said  um

there  are  like  a  lot  of  its  relating  to

like  just  general  budget  cuts  throughout

the  system  too

um  like  at  low  now  I  definitely  see  that

like  we  also  are  experiencing  vegetables

I  know  like  recently

um we  had  took  a  lot  of  our  programs

um and  were  fortunate  to  have  like  a

strong  like  Alumni  Association  on  the

parent  teacher  student  Association  which

were  able  to  donate  um  some  money  to  our

schools  but  I  also  recognize  that  a  lot

of  other  schools  dont  have  that

privilege  as  well

I  think  definitely  the

um  Chinatown  elderly  so  a  lot  of  them

actually  live  in  like  single  room

occupancies  where  theyre  kind  of

sharing  like  a  really  small  room  with

the  entire  building  they  share  the  same

like  kitchens  or  showers  and  bathrooms

and  I  will  say  that  like  a  lot  of  them

have  I  guess  just  a  language  barrier

like  its  really  its  really  evident

that  like  share  their  like  affordable

housing  like  opportunities  opening  up

for  them  but  its  really  hard  for  not  to

apply  to  these  things  when  they  dont

know  the  language  that  like  the

applications  are  in  and  so  I  always  say

that  Ive  kind  of  noticed  that  like  a

lot  of  the  elderly  living  around  San

Francisco  and  like  that  freaking  the

parks  a  lot  a  lot  of  them  have  like

issues  with  getting  like  better  housing

because  a  lot  of  them  are  just  like  they

they  just  dont  have  like  the  really

resources  to  actually  translate  these

things  and  they  dont  have  like  people

like  on  site  with  them  actively  trying

to  help  them  out  of  the  situation

can  definitely  say  like  more  people  of

color  they  have  a  lot  of  like  a

difficult  time

like

being  able  to  have  like  the  same

opportunities  is  like  other

like

people  who  are  more  I  guess

I  get  different

and  um

but  I  do  think  that  the  way

theyre  placed  because  more  of  like

people  of  color  are  placed  in  like  more

um  its  called  not  so  good  areas  which  I

do  think

um  that  should  change  I  feel  like

everybody  should  be  evenly  like

have  the  same  chance

I  I  was  thinking  that  uh  people  coming

into  San  Francisco  like  maybe  new

immigrants  with  like  a  language  barrier

or  maybe  like  uh  formerly  like  people

went  to  war  back  then  like  uh  former

veterans  if  theyre  coming  back  with

like  trauma  or  like  immigrants  are

coming  with  a  language  barrier  it  might

be  hard  to  access  like  jobs  which  are

like  one  of  the  most  important  things  to

uh

getting  someone  started  uh  in  a  good

life  so

I  think  maybe  more  resources  for  those

communities  would  really  help

yeah  um  like

um  all  three  of  them  said  with  like

um  newly  arrived  immigrants

um

veterans  and  also  communities  of  color

and  I  really  like  what  Ariana  said  too

about  how  these  populations  are  like

especially  like  communities  of  color

typically  they  to  typically

um  there  are  certain  neighborhoods  where

um  theres  higher  constitutions  of  um

of  communities  of  color  because  because

of  housing  prices  because  of

affordability  and  because  of  like  the

sense  of  community  that  provides  them

with

and  I  think

um

yeah  and  I  think  adding  on  another  key

um demographic  is  also  like  lgbtq  plus

folks  and  Im  also

um  formerly  incarcerated  folks  who  might

be  at  a  disbantage  or  like  at  a  higher

risk  for

um  homelessness



um

like  a  lot  of  prices  are  going  up  and  I

feel  like  people  who  are  older  very  Im

not  saying  they  are  cat  like  things  kind

of  established  but  like  they

or  you  kind  of  have  like

like  some  mirrors

like  you  did  everything  you  still  have

to  try  it

get  there  now  in  this  um

I  kind  of  want  to  add  on  to  that  I  think

in  the  past  like  you  know  stories  about

like  people  like  buying  their  houses

like  a  long  time  ago  in  like  the  sunset

for  like  I  dont  know  fifty  thousand

dollars  or  like  just  a  really  cheap

price  you  know  but  now  the  same  house

goes  for  over  a  million  dollars  and  so

the  income  which  is  have  not  like  a  job

to  to  how  how  fast  a  housing  Markets

rising  in  SF  especially  and  even  like

cities  like  Seattle  or  like  Portland

like  a  lot  of  them  across  the  coast

theyre  all  just  the  prices  are  going

way  higher  than  our  incomes  are  going  to

match  up  to  and  so  especially  right  now

because  Im  applying  to  college  soon  I

kind  of  like  Im  kind  of  balancing

between  like  picking  a  major  without

making  a  lot  of  money  later  on  or  ones  I

actually  enjoy  doing  just  because  I  do

know  that  like  money  is  at  the  end  of

the  day  we  live  in  a  capitalist  Society

right  so  money  is  really  important  and

so  if  I  really  do  want  like  to  have  like

a  couple  of  Life  later  on  I  do  have  to

like  make  the  decision  between  pursuing

something  more  interested  in  or

something  that  will  get  me  more  money

and  I  feel  like  a  lot  of  you  are  making

that  decision  around  me  as  Im  talking

to  more  friends  and  stuff  a  lot  of  them

are  the  same  like  predicament  that  Im

in  and  I  feel  like  in  the  past  it  wasnt

like  that  and  so  it  almost  feels  a

little  unfair  that  our  society  has

gotten  to  the  point  where  a  lot  of  you

are  feeling  like  more  like  the  burdens

of  all  the  financial  decisions  that  they

make  later  on  or  falling  out  of  them

yeah  if  we  go  uh  I  was  just  thinking

about  like  the  weve  been  Ive  been

asking  my  history  class  like  do  you

think  the  American  dream  is  getting

harder  and  that  it  may  be  a  think  back

to  that  I  think  uh  yes  the  American

dream  is  harder  now  because  uh  that  like

if  someones  immigrating  to  America  the

chances  of  them  getting  like  a  high

paying  job  is  not  as  high  as  someone

whos  already  here  I  feel  like  so  its

like  what  the  housing  prices  even  higher

and  like  uh  Jackie  said  the  housing

prices  are  higher  but  the  pay  isnt  much

higher  so  it  makes  a  makes  the  Gap

bigger  and  it  makes  it  much  more

difficult  to  get  a  property

yeah  I  definitely  agree  and  something

Ive  noticed  is  that

um

a  lot  of  my  fellow  peers  like  a  lot  of

them  have  such  like  a  deep  love  of  San

Francisco  too  and  I  know  a  lot  of  the

adults  have  spoken  to  also  share  that

same  like  commitment  the  same  thing  same

like  passion  for  San  Francisco  where

theyd  love  to  stay  in  the  city  but  it

simply  is  like  unrealistic  so  a  lot  of

them  are  making  plans  to  either

um  not  return  to  the  city  after  pursuing

higher  education  somewhere  else  or

living  like  somewhere  around  the  Bay

Area  and  commuting  into  San  Francisco

and  working  yeah  and  also  I  noticed  that

a  lot  of  these  barriers  are  like

interconnected  too

um  and  some  population  some  populations

are  also  like  higher  risks  like  kind  of

like  communities  or  young  people  of

color  and  also  like  young  bunch  of  btq

folks  for  example  who  may  not  have  like

the  generational  wealth  that  when  Kelly

was  speaking  to  a  second  ago  and  they

might  their  parents  might  not  own  a  home

in  San  Francisco  and  that  puts  them  at

like  higher  risk  of  being  pushed  out  of

our  city

Marie  I  just  love  the  community  in  San

Francisco  I  mean  I  grew  up  in  like

Chinatown  and  so  I  love  just  how  like

interconnected  our  community  feels  like

growing  up  in  like  I  mean  North  America

as  old  as  Chinatown  it  feels  like  our

community  has  grown  so  much  and  weve

been  through  so  much  together  that  even

though  like  youre  walking  on  the

streets  a  lot  of  times  my  family  we

often  run  into  people  that  like  we

didnt  really  know  but  like  weve  heard

about  them  and  so  my  parents  go  say  hi

to  them  and  then  they  check  a

conversation  about  like  stories  from

back  in  child  and  stuff  like  that  and  so

it  feels  like  our  communities  is  so

interconnected  like  a  lot  of  times  you

see  other  people  on  the  streets  in

Chinatown  that  you  havent  seen  in  a

long  time  and  then  you  talk  to  them  for

like  hours  on  end  and  so  I  just  love  how

San  Francisco  is  so  like  theres  only

communities  in  it  but  at  the  same  time

every  Community  is  so  different  and

every  Community  is  so  welcoming

a  lot  of  people  are  like  helpful  and  I

feel  like

oh  no  I  just  love  like  just  Im  more  of

like  a  really  Grandma  mistake  because

theres  really  funny  because  I  was  like

a  nervous  averaging  person  and  its

weird  because  she  grew  up  in  San

Francisco  all  her  life  and

like  loves  the  suburbs  and  I  grew  up

making  the  suburb  and  I  would  love  to

see  so  I  really  want  to  like  I  dont

know  if  I  want  to  move  to  San  Francisco

because  it  is  really  busy  like  I  dont

know  if  I  could  be  able  to

deal  with  like  all  the  business  but  its

not  as  bad  as  New  York  but

um  I  do  love  San  Francisco  I  love  like

all  the  traditions  and  I  love  like  all

the  like  I  love  the  food  too

good  I  love  the  um

just  like  the  scenery  in  the  buildings

everything  the  architecture  is  really

you  know

yeah  Im  like  adding  lots  of work  both

um  this  is  what  Im  saying  I  also  like

really  love  the  community  like  having

different  like  cultural  neighborhoods

for  example  which  I  know  the  planning

department  has  been  working  on  like  for

example

um  like  the  Castro  with  their  lgbtq  plus

Community  the

um the  mission  for  example  and  Chinatown

2  which  I  know  its  not  a  cultural

neighborhood  but  still  its  like  a

really  its  like  a  cultural  inkling

still  and  I  think  thats  like  a  really

crucial  part  of  what  I  love  about  San

Francisco  and  also  uh  yeah  the  more  I

work  with  like  youth  workspaces  or  just

like  Community  advocacy  advocacy  spaces

Ive  realized  how  a  lot  of  our  city

departments  a  lot  of  our  immunizations

they  work  through  like  an  equity  Focus

lens  where

um  it  up  some  marginalized  communities

and  I  feel  like  that  isnt

talked  about  like  enough  like  on  a

national  stage  or

um  or  in  like  different  states  or

different  cities  and  as  for  what

aspirative

um  Im  looking  to  come  back  to  San

Francisco  I  think

its  something  complicated  question

um I  feel  like  when  anyones  asked  me  if

or  where  I  want  to  pursue  higher

education  Ive  always  told  them  that  I

want  to  go  far  like  I  want  to  go  maybe

like  East  Coast  or  SoCal  and  I  dont

want  to  stay  anywhere  too  close  to  the

city  thats  the  same  like  the  same  time

I  know  like  at  the  back  of  my  head  I

fully  intentionally  come  back  to  San

Francisco  after  uh  pursuing

um  higher  education  and  after

um  studying  somewhere  over  here

yeah  I  love  San  Francisco  because  uh  the

bike  Lanes  Im  a  biker  so  its  pretty

convenient  to  go  places  and  I  feel  like

many  other  cities  like  theres  not  much

attention  to  bikers  so  I  said  its  great

for  that  and  uh  I  agree  with  Jackie

about  like  the  equity  plans  because  like

in  the  outer  Mission  I  feel  like  there

was  less  attention  back  then  its  like

when  I  was  really  young  coyoto  Park  was

renovated  from  like  super  sand  like  it

was  full  of  sand  so  its  kind  of

dangerous  to  be  running  around  or

playing  in  it  but  then  its  been

remodeled  and  then  now  its  being  even

better  maintained  so  I  appreciate  like

the  extra  effort  being  put  in  like  uh

the  illegal  dumping  on  the  streets  uh

the  Department  of  Public  Works  has  been

doing  a  great  job  cleaning  that  up

recently  and  like  uh  the  transit  and

pedestrian  focused  streets  like  just

making  our  streets  a  better  place  not

just  like  for  cars  to  drive  fast

while  also  accommodating  for  them  too

and  then

um  I  also  like  the  green  spaces  like

Golden  Gate  Park  is  great  its  like  a

lot  of  urban  spaces  uh  dont  really  have

that  uh  Greenery  so  its  like  you  have

like  the  urban  Parts  but  you  also  have

like  Golden  Gate  Park  which  is  like

makes  you  forget  that  youre  in  the  city

for  a  little  bit

I  can  kind  of  kick  it  off

um  Im  hoping  for  a  service  its  gonna

be  more  like  a  Goodwill  overall  I  feel

like  there  are  so  many  neighborhoods  and

so  many  communities  in  SF  but  a  lot  of

times  were  only  focused  on  the  ones

that  are  more  like  Northern  like  the

marina  or  maybe  North  Beach  or  even

Chinatown  but  I  feel  like  there  are  so

many  that  Ive  forgotten  like  the  ones

where  we  live  like  the  Bay  View  or  the

otter  Mission  orophistication  Valley

even  Portola  so  I  feel  like  I  would  love

for  SF  to  be  moving  towards  more  like

making  these  like  communities  known  also

and  like  kind  of  like  like  mainstreaming

them  more  is  adding  more  libraries  or

adding  like  better  like  partlets  also  I

think  parklets  would  be  a  great  addition

to  all  these  neighborhoods  Im

mentioning  because  I  feel  like  we  also

have  like  pretty  nice  weather  around

here  too  and  it  would  be  great  for  like

SF  particular  advantage  of  that  and  to

like  push  these  communities  more  to  like

the  tourists  that  come  maybe  like  maybe

they  should  explore  neighborhoods  too

you  know

I  could  share  because  I  think  with  SF

like  working  to  develop  more  whats

dangerous  about  that  is  gentrification

so  Id  like  to  see  like  uh  during  the

development  process

uh  like  people  keeping  in  mind  uh

gentrification  and  like  how  it  could

increase  the  cost  of  a  neighborhood  so

Im  not  really  sure  how  that  works  but

uh  developers  and  like  planners  got  to

be  really  careful  to  not  drive  the  costs

too  high  or  else  people  will  start

getting  uh  moved  out  of  their  homes

on  a  similar  note  I  think  I  would  love

to  see  more  development  on

um  on  areas  of  our  city  which

historically  havent  been

um  havent  had  much  development  I  know

thats  a  major  component  of  this  housing

element  like  the  new  the  newly  updated

one  and  I  like  I  vapely  remember  like  a

statistic  that  was  brought  up  in  like  a

recent  meeting  with  like  the  college

interns  and  I  know  some  of  us  sat  in  um

on  it  were  like  85  of  like  the  new

housing  units  have  been  built  on  like

the  east  or  like  the  central

um area  of  our  city  so  we  have  like

neighborhoods  where  it  remains  a  single

family  homes  and  which

um  havent  been  developed  much  and  as  a

result  we  we  are  stuck  in  a  housing

crisis  I  think  yeah  and

see  more  develop  in  these  areas  of  our

city  would  allow  for  more

um  affordable  homes  and

yeah  and  I  think  thatll  help  a  lot  with

reaching  our  goal  of  like  um 80  or  88k

Im  housing

um  that  were  trying  to  reach  and

another  area  Id  love  to  see  is  just

like  continue  work  on  our  Equity

um  areas  I  know  once  again  like  a  lot  of

our  city  departments  have  adopted  uh

maps  and

that  just  like  identify  um  areas  where

were  prioritizing  some  neighborhoods  so

I  would  love  to  see  more  like  work  on

that  end

um  to  address  some  of  the  issues  that

um  these  like  neighborhoods  are  facing

um  I  can  definitely  agree  with  Chad

carefully

um  the  housing  I  feel  like  we  probably  I

would  like  to  see  it  be  more  spread  out

um  instead  of  like  mainly  and  just

some  areas  and  then  also  I  feel  like  I

dont  know  I  feel  like  the  roads

kind  of  to  be  fixed  a  little  because

theres  a  lot  of  buttholes  theres  like

a  lot

um  and  then  also

um the  homeless  crisis  too  I  feel  like  I

do  want  to  see  that  fixed  as  well

and

and  yeah
