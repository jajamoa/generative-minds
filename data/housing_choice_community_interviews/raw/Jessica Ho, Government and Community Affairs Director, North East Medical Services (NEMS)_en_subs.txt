my  name  is  Jessica  ho  and  I  am  the

government  and  Community  Affairs

director  for  Northeast  Medical  Services

Im  a  fairly  qualified  Health  Center

based  in  the  city  and  I  my  connection  to

San  Francisco  is  through  my  family

my  familys  connection  to  the  city  is  a

really  I  think  cool  story

I  was  born  in  1987  and  I  met  my

grandmother  when  she  was  already  living

in  Sunnyvale  but  she  had  lived  eight

years  in  San  Francisco  before  that  and

Taiwan  before  that  my  grandfather

unfortunately  never  met  him  but  he  died

at  the  hospital  in  San  Francisco  and  was

buried  in  coma  but  his  the  last  place  he

lived  was  in  the  sunset

and  my  my  grandmother  was  a  really

awesome  woman  I  think  she  really  defined

who  I  am  a  lot  in  my  growth  she  couldnt

have  children  so  she  actually  adopted  my

mother  at  a  time  when  women  were

not  desired  in  China  so  I  thought  that

was  a  pretty  amazing  that  my  mother

would  not  be  alive  if  it  werent  for  my

grandmother

um  and  my  my  grandmother  also  was  just  a

very  smart  businesswoman  she  bought  she

she  and  her  husband  my  grandfather

invested  in  homes  in  the  sunset  so  we

had  property  um

even  though  like  in  the  1980s  when  they

moved  here

I  did  I  knew  there  was

um  still  racism  and  you  know  I  was  but

apparently  at  that  time  a  lot  of  her

friends  already  lived  in the  sunset  and

they  chose  to  move  to  San  Francisco  out

of  everywhere  else  because  they  had  um

they  had  heard  in  their  home  country

Taiwan  that  it  was  a  welcome  place  for

Chinese  immigrants  so  thats  why  they

chose  San  Francisco  and  then  because  of

their  friends  they  chose  the  sunset

district  and  because  of  that  they  bought

homes  there  and  because  of  that  I  lived

there  so  its  kind  of  thats  the

connection

so  what  I  um  was  born  in  1987  uh  I  did

not

I  was  not  in  San  Francisco  I  was  born  in

Los  Angeles

County  and  my  parents  had  moved  there

for  for  work  but  we  would  come  up  and

visit  my  grandmother  in  the  Bay  Area

very  often  she  lived  in  Sunnyvale  at  the

time  but  wed  go  up  to  San  Francisco

from  time  to  time

and  when  I  went  to  college  at  UC

Berkeley  my  parents  moved  up  to  one  of

the  homes  she  owned  in  the  sunset

District  so  I  spent  the  last  year  of  my

college  uh  going  to  Berkeley  also  living

in  the  sunset  district  and  then  after

that  my  parents  moved  away  to  Gilroy  but

I  stayed  in  that  house  and  I  went  to

school  at  UCSF  and  then  yeah  so  I

I  wouldnt  be  in  the  sunset  if  I  didnt

know  where  to  go  I  didnt  know  where  the

sunset  was  I  didnt  know  anything  about

it  but  that  was  when  my  parents  you  know

thats  where  they  lived  they  told  me  to

come  here  and  I  started  my  life  there

and  thats  I  fell  in  love  with  the  with

the  sunset  in  the  city

and  if  you  dont  mind  me  asking  are  you

still  in  one  of  the  homes  that  your

grandparents  bought  or  uh  no  so  I  after

UCSF  I  went  to  Johns  Hopkins  to  get  my

Masters  in  health  policy  and  public

health  and  my  parents  I  did  I  think  they

were

um  not  sure  what  to  do  with  the  house  so

they  sold  it  which  is  really  unfortunate

because  I  did  you  know  go  to  school  and

I  um  did  internships  here  in  Sacramento

and  DC  and  then  ended  up  finding  a  job

in  LA  but  then  coming  back  to  San

Francisco  and  when  I  asked  my  parents

about  the  house  like  oh  we  sold  it  and

so  I  had  to  find  a  flat  that  I  paid  like

2  500  a  month  for  a  three-story  walk-up

one  bedroom  one  bath  on  Irving  and  20th

Avenue

no  so  now  um

I  have  moved  and  I  am  now  living  in  one

of  the  newest  uh  buildings  in  the  sunset

District  the  ones  that  um  its  called

the  Providence

complex  where  the  hospital  used  to  be

and  now  they  have  theres  a  lot  of  um  I

think  its  about  almost  over  80  housing

units  in  that  complex  a  bunch  of  homes

kind  of

geometrically  on  top  of  one  another  but

because  of  that  I  mean  it  works  out

perfectly  we  have  a  three  best  three

bedroom

um  we  bought  it  in  the  pandemic  I  mean

it  wasnt  the  best  price  but  you  know  it

was  actually  much

it  was  it  was  nice  because  we  were  not

outbid

I  had  looked  for  housing  before  the

pandemic  and  every  time  we  put  an  offer

we  were  outbid  so  it  was  really  awful

and  then  we  just  happened  to  find  this

opening  and  uh  was  lucky  enough  to

secure  it  so  now  I  own  my  own  place  in

the  sunset

so  I  guess  my  story  is  unique  in  that  um

I  dont  think  I  was  old  enough  because

my  grandmother  was  like  70  by  the  time  I

was  born  and  my  grandfather  wasnt  there

I  dont  think  they

really  shared  that  piece  with  me  I  think

the  only

um  thing  I  can  really  speak  to  is

they  they  struggled  with  language  access

because  they  moved  here  in  their  60s  and

70s  they  could  not  speak  English  and  so

my  grandmother  tried  to  learn  English

but  really  just  couldnt  communicate

with  people  and  I  think  she  really

struggled  a  lot  with  that  she  also

didnt  learn  how  to  drive

and  so  that  was  also  difficult  for  her

getting  around  so  I  think  these  were

barriers  but  not  necessarily  from  her

purchasing  her  own  home  I  dont  know

how  it  was  for  her  because  I  wasnt

there  with  her  what  I  do  know  is  that  um

something  Ive  learned  from  my

grandmother  and  her  surviving  friends  in

real  estate  that  I  dont  really  see  in

mainstream  real  estate  is  that

um

in  Chinese

in  no  let  me  rephrase  uh  my  grandmother

went  into  business  with  many  of  her

friends  in  order  to  purchase  property

whereas  I  dont  know  if  thats  the  case

for  people  who  can  afford  a  home  right

out  so  like  she  owned  harsh  portions  of

homes  she  owned  portions  of  parking  lot

shed  own  portions  of  shopping  malls  she

didnt  own  the  whole  thing  but  she  went

in  partnership  with  people  she  trusted

which  I  thought  was  really  interesting

because  even  now  I  dont  go  into

business  with  my  money  with  my  friends

to  purchase  property  thats  not

something  I  think  about  but  for  for  them

that  was  their  way  to  survive

yeah

um  like  I  mentioned  my  my  grandmother

chose  the  sunset  because  she  already  had

friends  living  there  and  so  that  was  why

she  decided  that  area  rather  than  any

other  like  Chinatown  for  instance  which

I  thought  was  really  interesting  she

loved  shopping  on  Irving  Street  she

would  take  the  L  car  to  Chinatown  and  do

her  business  there  but  she  liked  living

in  the  sunset  District  she  didnt  like

the  weather  thats  why  she  moved  to

Sunnyvale

um

which  I  thought  was  pretty  funny

uh  but  yeah  I  think  um that  was  a  big

factor  having  friends  who  could  speak

her  language  and  feel  make  her  feel

comfortable  especially  at  her  age  I

think  that  was  really  a  big  factor  of

why  she  chose  a  sunset  in  1980.  Im

pretty  sure  things  were  different  in

1880.  um actually  I  dont  think  they

would  even  there  was  any  housing  out

there  in  18  I  think  theyre  just  sand

dudes  at  that  point

um but  yes  I  think  that  was  a  big  factor

in  her  choosing  San  Francisco  was  the

Chinatown  that  arrived  in  Chinatown  her

friends  in  the  sunset  it  was  probably  it

was  the  closest  its  actually  the

closest  point  to  Taiwan  of  America

besides  Hawaii  yes  and  Alaska  but  you

know  like  at  the  mainland

um so  I  think  that  that  was  also  a

factor

and  for  for  me  I  think  whats

fascinating  is  that

um  when  I  first  moved  here  in  2009

I

I  was  really

Amazed  by  the  number  of  second

generation  third  generation  Chinese

Americans  in  the  sunset  Ive  never  seen

this  growing  up  even  at  Berkeley  I

didnt  see  it  very  much

it  was  just

they  were  like  Americans  but  Asian

looking  and  it  was  amazing  and  their

even  their  parents  were  spoke  fluent

English  and  were  cool  and  just  very

Americanized  and  I  didnt  have  that

experience  either  growing  up  so  I  think

that  really  for  the  first  time  changed

my  whole  perception  of  what  it  meant  to

be  Asian  American  and  I  really  loved  it

and  I  think  thats  one  of  the  reasons

why  I  continued  to  love  the  sunset

because  I  think  its  a  place  where

cultures  actually  have  melded  together

and  to  become  something  new  to  become  a

new  type  of  American

I  think  the  problem  with  the  sunset  is

that  it  hasnt  changed  over  the  years  it

hasnt  grown  with  the  times

um  like  we  I  think  I  mentioned  earlier

in  this  interview  that  in  1880  there

were  no  Realms  and  in  1980  by  then

Chinese  people  could  own  homes  and  in

between  then  was  a  lot  of  other  stories

that  Im  sure  youll  cover  it  with  your

other  interviews  and

I  think  that

now  we  are  in  its  been  50  years  50  plus

years  and  that  I  live  in  one  of  the

newest  homes  in  the  sunset  that  was

built  in  2000.

so  I  mean  that  just  speaks  to

how  the  lack  of  of  growth  in  the  sunset

in  terms  of  housing

um

is  where  it  was  the  reality  we  faced

today

I  I  would  say  that  the  majority  of  my

friends  uh  and  Im

in  my  30s

um  probably  dont  own  homes  right  now

like  they  dont  they  dont  live  in  the

place  they  grow  up  in  a  lot  of  the

people  that  I  knew  who  were  still  living

with  their  parents  in  their  20s  I  dont

think  they  are  owning  their  homes  they

may  rent  a  home  or  a  flat  in  the  sunset

but  I  think  that  is  that  speaks  to  not

only  an  issue  with  the  sunset  District  I

think  thats  just  the  housing  issue  in

America  but  also  exists  in  the  sunset

District  I  do  recognize  that  there

hasnt  been  a  lot  of

proposed  housing  or  housing  thats  been

approved  in  the  sunset  I  know  thats

something  thats  being  discussed

currently

um

and

I  I  think  that  while  building  more

housing  is  definitely  part  of  the

solution

I  also  do  think  that  its  important  to

recognize  the  price  of  Housing  and  not

everyone

may  have  the  privilege  of  being  able  to

purchase  a  home

as  well

I  dont  have  any  children  so  I  dont

know  if  I  can  speak  to  the  family  aspect

of  things  but  where  I  live  there  are

families

and  a  lot  of  people  who  live  in  the  same

units  that  we  do

um  and  its  difficult

like  I  think  everyone  would  like  more

space

right  everyone  would  love  a  large  yard

and  thats  the  closest  you  can  get  a

sunset  but  you  can  its  not  the  same  as

living  in  like  a  in  a  suburban  area  but

at  the  same  time  thats  not  what  we  why

we  chose  the  sunset  we  dont  want  to  be

living  in  Suburbia  but  we  also  dont

want  to  be  living  in  the  middle  of  the

city

um

and  so

I  do  think  that

this  question  has  many  layers

I  think  that  because  people  who  cant

afford  to  live  in  the  sunset  or  San

Francisco  in  general  are  moving  further

away  from  San  Francisco  and  not  to  other

states  necessarily  but  just  to  the  East

Bay  to  the  South  Bay  to  the  north

however  they  can  find  affordable  housing

and  I  think  that  does  change  the  dynamic

of  people  who  are

living  in  San  Francisco  just  because  as

anyone  knows  we  we  spend  our  time  with

the  people  who  are  closest  to  us

geographically  and  now  that  the  pandemic

is  over  and  were  doing  things  in  person

if  youre  not  physically  there  youre

not  going  to  build  the  same  type  of

relationship  with  someone  as  if  you  were

physically  there  so  I  think  where  you

live  does  make  a  difference  in  how  you

live  your  life  so  I  do  think  that  where

you  live  will  or  where  people  live  will

definitely  shape  and  influence

how  San  Franciscos  culture  becomes  and

also  how  we  see  and  view  Children  and

Families

and

I  think  its  actually  a  story  yet  to  be

seen

I  think  were  still  writing  it  as  we  as

we  speak

sure

um  so

I

renting  is  difficult  because

is  a  person  whos  trying  to  come  in  the

city  we  dont  necessarily  have  the

privilege  of  rent  control

or  rent  control  prices  per  se

and  so

um

theyre  a  little  outrageous  and  I  know

that  Ive  heard  some  of  the  prices  have

come  down  through  the  pandemic  which  is

great  but

yeah  I  think  once  no  matter  if  youre

paying  a  thousand  or  two  thousand  or

even  5  000  for  rent

um

my  familys  philosophy  is  if  youre

paying  rent  to  someone  else  youre

paying  down  their  mortgage  and  not

paying  on  your  own  which

over  time  its  just  not  going  to  be  a

beneficial  thing  for  you  and  so  thats

why  its  always  better  in  our  opinion  to

buy  a  home  because  whatever  we  pay  to

the  mortgage  company  eventually  does

benefit  us  so  thats  why  I  always  knew  I

would  want  to  buy  a  place  but  when  I

started  looking

I  didnt  think  I  had  enough  funds

because  I  had  you  know  just  started  a

new  job  and  wasnt  really  didnt  I  mean

I  tried  saving  but  you  know  its  hard  in

these  times  and  I  actually  went  to  just

randomly  because  I  used  to  intern  for

Carmen  too  she  had  when  she  was  an

assessory  quarter  this

uh  like  Finance  literary

event  in  like  this  South  East  quadrant

of  San  Francisco  like  somewhere  in  the

Bayview  I  think  and  I  was  like  all  right

well  Ill  come  to  support  like  Carmen

but  um not  that  interested  or  live  in

the  Bay  View  but  I  went  and  they  made

you  sit  down  with  financial  counselors

and  theyre  asking  you  questions  Im

like  look  Im  just  here  to  volunteer  I

dont  know  what  you  want  me  to  do  like

well  youre  here  so  like  lets  talk

about  your  finances  Im  like  okay  and

Im  like  hes  like  whats  one  of  your

reach  dreams  like  I  would  love  to  buy  a

home  hes  like  why  dont  you  do  it  now

Im  like  well  because  I  dont  have

enough  funds  and  hes  like  lets  like

think  about  that  right  and  be  creative

with  what  you  have  and  how  you  want  to

achieve  that  goal  and  start  your  plan

today  and  because  of  that  I  think  it

really  inspired  me  to  like  think  about

it  because  I  was  like  no  Im  not  I  was

31  at  the  time  I  was  like  Im  not  gonna

buy  a  home  like  no  one  else  though  I

dont  know  anyone  else  whos  who  has  a

home  in  San  Francisco  like  Ive  already

bought  a  place  in  Sacramento  but  thats

like  you  know  very  very  different  prices

at  that  point  so  yeah  like  I  didnt

really  think  about  it

um  but

I  talked  with  my  parents  who  Ive  you

know  have  um

a  lot  of  experience  in  real  estate  and

we  came  up  with  a  plan  and  figured  out

you  know  what  I  could  potentially  get  in

a  mortgage  we  applied  for  a  loan  which

was  a  long  process  but  at  the  time  we

had  really  good  interest  rates  I  think

thats  not  the  case  right  now  but  I  was

able  to  lock  in  a  very  good  uh  interest

rate  and

um  after  that  first  phase  is  complete

and  you  have  the  financing  I  think  then

the  rest  is  just

finding  the  house  and  so  we  went  to

maybe

like  20  open  houses

um  all  around  the  sunset  District  I  even

looked  at  places  outside  the  sunset

District  that  were  potentially  cheaper

like  Ingleside

um  the  Portola  like  I  looked  at  other

locations  but  um

we  put  down  three  offers  and  every  time

we  put  on  an  offer  at  that  time  we  were

completely  outbid  and  it  was  like

ridiculous  that  I  think

there  was  one  that  was  listed  for  1.2

million  dollars  and  you  know  of  course

you  want  to  put  something  better  than

that  but  then  it  eventually  got  sold  for

1.6  million  cash

and  so  were  like  theres  no  way  that  we

would  have  been  able  to  compete  with

that

um  and

I  think  another  really  difficult

situation  at  least  when  I  was  buying  in

2020

was  that  because  it  was  a  sellers

market

the  buyers  really  couldnt  ask  for  any

contingencies  if  the

the  house  was  in  complete  dilapidated

state

they  wouldnt  do  anything  to  fix  it  it

would  be  sold  as  is  you  wouldnt  know

really  sometimes  about  the  structure  of

the  house  and  why  theyre  selling  it

they  would  just  have  to  take  it  at  face

value  like  you  wouldnt  know  if  you

inherited

like  a  ticking  Time  Bomb  so  that  was

always  a  concern  a  lot  of  the  homes  in

the  sunset  are  unpermitted

there  were  a  lot  of  unpermitted  um

houses  that  have  in-laws  which

automatically  excluded  my  interest

because  I  didnt  want  to  go  through  the

planning  process  of  of  right

um  writing  that  process  so

yeah  that  was  also  a  problem  too  and

yeah  there  were  just  a  lot  of  uh  issues

I  think

understanding  what  the  sunset  means  to

me

is  a  hard  thing  to  verbalize  because  as

with  maybe  other  people  I

its  more  of  a  Feeling

more  than  something  I  could  really

explain

I  think

theres  just  this  magical  feeling  and

Im  not  usually  into

Im  Im  a  pretty  scientifically  minded

person  so  I  I  typically  like  to  follow

up  my  statements  with  reasoning  and  um

but  when  it  comes  to  where  you  live  and

personal  choices  like  who  you  love  those

are  things  that  you  cant  really

explain  logically  sometimes  and  I  think

thats  kind  of  what  the  sunset  is  to  me

its

when  I  first

when  I  first  moved  in  to  my  place

um  our  place  in  23  34  29th  Avenue

I  felt

for  the  first  time

like  I  could  be  myself

and  I  could  breathe

and

Ive  never  felt  that  anywhere  else

so  the  question  is  do  I  think  that

there  are  communities  in  San  Francisco

that  are  more  well  resourced

I  mean

I  would  be  a  fool  to  say  no

um  I  wouldnt  say  that  they  have

everything  that  you  listed  like

transportation  and  public  services  and

restaurants  and  dining  and  entertainment

all  in  one  area  but  I  definitely  think

certain  areas  are  more  well  resourced

because  of  the  people  who  occupy  them

right  and  so

for  instance  lets  just  take  a  Seacliff

for  instance  right  there  are  no  nearby

restaurants  nearby  hair  salons  nearby

cultural  centers  is  just  a  lot  of  nice

houses  and  nice  views  right  in  the  China

Beach  but

um

does  that  mean  they  want  more  well

researched  theres  no  transportation

that  goes  there  really  I  mean  they

actually  dont  want  that  so  I  dont  know

if

being  more  well  resourced  necessarily

translates  to  a  wealthier  wealth

well-off  Place  per  se  whereas  lets  say

Chinatown  is  extremely  well  resourced

but  the  people  who  occupy  a  lot  of  units

in  the  Chinatown  sros  make  less  than

minimum  wage  less  than  federal  poverty

level  so  does  that  better  I  dont  I

dont  think  so  I  think  that  the  point  of

people  coming  through  Chinatown  is  not

to  stay  in  nsro  but  to  move  out  and  and

be  able  to  find  their  own  place  in  in

space  and  not  only  physically  but  you

know  in  the  world

transportation

please  for  the  love  of  God  please  for

the  love  of  God  we  of  our  public

transportation  out  there  is

oh  yeah  all  of  it

I  want  faster  I  and  I  and  I  think  this

is  actually  very  timely  because  El

terrible  Im  on  the  board  of  people

peroxide  Sunset

um I  worked  for  Katie  when  she  was

supervisor  and  we  really  did  not  like

that  plot  project  or  we  wanted  to  make

sure  that  it  didnt  impact  businesses

and  nems  has  four  sites  on  terrible  uh

and  yeah  it  impacts  businesses  and  its

terrible  and  its  really  something  that

we  cant  help  because  it  has  to  get  done

but  I  mean

thats  the  the  conundrum  right  we  need

better  transportation  but  then  do  people

really  have  what  it  takes  to

endure  what

all  the  the  construction  and  changes

that  need  to  happen  for  it  to  happen

right  and  we  just  dont  know  because  we

havent  experienced  it  yet  and  we

havent  at  least  in  my  lifetime  I  would

love  to  take  the  28  every  day  to  work

but  sometimes  if  I  miss  the  bus  its

like  10-15  minutes  Ill  take  it  back

because  I  dont  have  a  time  constraint

but  you  know  I  I  just  dont  have  that  or

the  7x  isnt  come  back  since  the

pandemic  or  the  NX  which  I  really  love

those  are  probably  some  of  my favorite

lines  the  28x  was  also  great  like  these

rapid  lines  that  are  meant  to  move

people  around  on  I  think  those  need  to

come  back  to  the  sunset  because  we  are

really  far  away  from  the  central  core

maybe  of  other  places  that  we  want  to

visit  in  the  city  its  also  extremely

impossible  or  extremely  difficult  if  not

impossible  to  get  to  the  southeast  side

and  the  mission  to  public  transportation

its  really  just  I  I  tried  it  doesnt

work

um  I  actually  think  its  easier  to  get

to  San  Jose  at  this  point  from  the

sunset  than  it  is  get  to  the  mission

because  Ive  done  it  because  we  have  a

clinic  in  Lundy  which  is  close  to  the

new  Milpitas  BART  station  so  I  took  the

67  bus  to  the  Milpitas  BART  station  to

the  muni  took  the  N  home

and  I  was  within  like  an  hour  and  a  half

and  I  couldnt  do  that

for  from  getting  the  sunset  to  the

mission

like  I  could  technically  take

the  end  down  to  downtown  and  then

transfer  but  like  its  just  a  security

circuitous  way  right  whereas  like

driving  does  in  fact  take  less  time

which  unfortunately  is  why  you  know  if

theres  no  parking  out  there  either

which  is  its  a  conundrum  its  all

difficult  so  I  think  public

transportation  would  be  a  really  great

asset  to  the  Sunset  and  there  are  a  lot

of  people

for  better  for  worse  that  dont  drive

who  live  in  the  sunset  and  really  rely

on  buses  like  my  husband  I  share  a  car

so  at  least  we  have  that

um  but  and  I  really  like  the  scooters

those  are  really  cool  and  all  other

alternative  ways  of  um

biking  or  skating  or  however  people  get

to  where  they  need  to  go

but  it  also  is  nice  just  to  have  a

workable  public  transportation  system  it

can  really  change  the  quality  of  life

Ill  tell  you  a  story  about  when  I  was

in  Baltimore

um because  it  changed  my  life  about  how

I  saw  public  transportation  Ive  always

loved  buses  but  when  I  was  in  Baltimore

I  didnt  have  a  car  I  didnt  really  uh

never  lived  on  the  East  Coast  dont

really  knew  I  didnt  know  how  it  was

like  to  live  in  Baltimore  I  didnt

really  understand  living  on  the  hospital

campus  was  living  one  of  the  worst

places  in  Baltimore  and  so  I  did  that

when  I  first  moved  in  and  I  couldnt  I

ate  pretzels  out  of  the  vending  machine

there  was  every  restaurant  even  in  the

hospital  closed  at  like  10  pm  and  like  I

for  the  first  couple  weeks  I  starved  I

didnt  really  I  couldnt  theres  only

one  bank  close  at  five  but  then  I  walked

in  445  and  11  closed  Im  like  it  will

close  at  five  and  Im  like  no  we  closed

at  four  anyway  so  I  couldnt  get

quarters  so  I  could  do  my  laundry  and  I

I  remember  just  being  so  miserable  like

I  really  didnt  know  how  to  survive  and

I  know  thats  to  do  some  part  of  just

growing  up  and  living  in  a  new  space  but

also  it  was  incredibly  challenging  in

within  the  walkable  space  and  plus  on

top  of  that  Baltimore  is  a  pretty  at

least  where  I  live  was  a  pretty

dangerous  area  at  the  time  and

um  it  was  not  uncommon  to  be  attacked

and  so  like  you  couldnt  really  walk  by

yourself  a  lot

um  but  Stephanie  Rawlings  Blake  the

current  the  then  mayor  of  Baltimore

started  the  charm  bus  program  Charm  City

bus  program

and  where  she  would  just  have  buses

circulate  for  free  from  where  I  live  to

Fells  Point  to  Federal  triangle  hill

whatever  Federal  Hill  and  to  the  to  the

to  the  downtown  area  and  it  just

circulated  every  you  know  so  I  was  able

to  take  the  bus  down  to  places  that  I

felt  safer  in  and  do  my  shopping  and  and

get  access  to  things  and  it  changed  my

life  it  really  did  like  I  dont  know

what  I  would  do  it  without  that  bus

system  and  I  would  sometimes  run  and  I

could  you  know  because  running  is  safer

than  walking  so  I  could  run  to  Fells

Point  and  the  harbor  and  then  take  the

bus  back  when  it  got  dark  and  I  felt

safe  that  way  and

you  know  public  transportation  can  save

lives

I  would  um  you  know  thats  a  really  big

question  as  well

um

I  think  that

its  gonna  youre  gonna  elicit  different

questions  different  answers  from

different  people  I  dont  know  if  Im  the

best  person  to  ask  about  that  I  mean  of

course  Im  gonna  promote  nems  because  we

are  Health  but  were  already  very

populated  in  the  sunset

um

or  in  the  city  too  uh  I  would  say  for

the  purposes  of

this  question  if  I  could  recommend

anything  that  you  guys  as  planning  could

do  to  improve  our  lives  it  would  be

whatever  new  buildings  are  built  to

build  elevators  in  them  because  theres

no  elevators  in  the  sunset  and  as  people

age  getting  up  those  stairs  are  not  easy

and  so  Ive  seen  a  lot  of  people  use

these  these  like  movable  chairs  that

kind  of  move  up  and  down  the  stairs  but

its  not  doesnt  seem  very  uh  like  a

long-term  suit  it  doesnt  seem  like  a

long-term  solution

I  think  that  the  people

of  San  Francisco

are  a  little  bit  more  self-selected  than

maybe  other  parts  of  the  world

um  I  came  to  San  Francisco  because  I

felt

of  the  way  I  felt  free  and  able  to

express  myself  in  ways  I  couldnt

express  myself  in  other  places  I  think

that  might  be  the  case  for  other  people

as  well  so  I  think  that  in  that  sense

were  always  going  to  hopefully  attract

like-minded  people  who  are  more

open-minded  maybe  than

people  who  are  just

the  general  population  and  I  think  that

does  add  to  the  um

uniqueness  of  San  Francisco

I  think  the  events  like  the  festivals

um

the  community  events  things  that  are

open  to  the  public  our  public  libraries

everything  that

our  city  tries  to  make  accessible  to

people  including  large  festivities  like

for  Chinese  New  Year  like  um

just  the  Han  for  the  philam  community

like

Pride  like  you  know  the  North  Beach

Festival  these  are  all  just

some  examples  of  events  that  really

celebrate  the  uniqueness  of  different

cultures  and  different  people  and

different  ideas  in  San  Francisco  and  I

think  thats  a

its  its  really  nice  to  see  that  I

think  that  thats  really  helps  show  not

only  ourselves  but  others  who  we  are  and

what  we  value  and  what  we  like  and  what

we

what  we  want  in  life

I  would  say  that  as  someone  who  helped

plan  the  North  Beach  Festival  this  year

the  planning  process

can  sometimes  be  very  difficult  and

actually  I  would  think  that  more

festivals  would  happen  if  the  costs  and

the  logistics  were  not  so  prohibitive

my  idea  of  affordable  housing  is  someone

who  can  afford  housing

I  mean  its  not  that  difficult  concept  I

think  we  make  it  difficult  sometimes

but

its

if  we  really  want  to  just

look  at  the  data

um

whoever  someone  may  like  whoever  you  ask

whatever  they  make

um  find  out  what  they  make  and  make  them

pay  30  of  their  costs  on  housing  and

I  would  consider  that  affordable  housing

Im  not  a  planner  so  Im  going  to  caveat

that  I  dont  know  what

is  possible  with  housing

um  and  I  dont  know  I  know  theres  a  lot

of  different  factors  that  go  into  where

you  can  build  and  how  you  can  build  and

how  high  you  can  build  not  just  planning

not  just  necessarily  zoning  but  just

nature  can  be  prohibitive  sometimes

but  I  I  would  say  that

um

if  we  could  go  taller  that  would  be  fine

with  me

and  what  is  that  what  does  that  mean  to

you  and  look  like  to  you  um  is  that  the

50-story  building  in  in  the  outer  sunset

at  the  beach  or  is  it  you  know  smart

growth  along  say  our  Transit  corridors

if  we  extend  out  the  muni  service  is  it

I  would  like  to  see  smart  growth  along

the  transit  corridors  I  think  that  we

already  have  an  opportunity  to  do  that

because  the  Zoning  for  Irving  and

Noriega  and  Taraval  I  think  even  parts

of  Judah  and  Lawton

we  havent  reached  those  high  intensity

limits  yet  so  theres  already  room  there

to  grow  along  Transit  corridors  I  think

the  caveat  is  do  we  have  enough  transit

to

serve  the  increase  in  people  who  live  in

those  Transit  corridors  and  around  those

Transit  corridors

but  I  also  think  that  if  we  could  make

it  easier  for  seniors  to  go  up  and  down

I  dont  see  why  we  cant  increase  the

heights  of  most  of  our  buildings  and

just  have

maybe  four  stories  not  necessarily  I

dont  think  I  think  50  stories  near  the

ocean  where  its  expected  to

be  under  the  ocean  at  some  point  is

maybe  not  the  best  planning  choice  not

only  because  it  may  not  I  dont  know

like  factors  of  wind  and  rust  and  you

know  how  the  ocean  eats  things  but  also

there  theres  a  high  possibility  that  it

may  be  the  beach  soon  so  I  dont  know  if

thats  really  the  smartest  plan  but  I  do

think  that  there  are  ways  to  increase

density  in  a  Smart  Way  in  the  sunset

district  for  sure
