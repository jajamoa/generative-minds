## Simulating Minds, Not Just Personas: Cognitive Motifs as a Symbolic Reasoning Layer for Diverse and Interpretable Agents

This repository implements Cognitive Motifsâ€”a symbolic reasoning layer for generative agents that replicates not just what people say, but how they think. By embedding reusable causal motifs between persona and decision output, our agents construct belief graphs grounded in real-world interviews. This framework enables diverse, consistent, and interpretable reasoning in simulations, with applications in policy modeling, social alignment, and beyond.
