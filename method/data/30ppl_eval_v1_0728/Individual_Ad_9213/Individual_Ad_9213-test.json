      "scenario_description": "Hi! I (29F) recently referred an ex-coworker to the company I currently work for, and I’d appreciate a second opinion on something that’s been bothering me.\n\nFor context: I used to work remotely with Mike at a previous company. We were in the same department, got along well, and were both consistently praised for our work, but we weren’t close—just friendly colleagues. I left that job 8 months ago due to poor management, and thanks to a referral from another coworker, I landed at my current company, which I really like.\n\nFour months ago, I saw an opening that Mike would be a great fit for, so I referred him. He got the job. Two months in, he messaged me asking about a referral bonus, which I honestly didn’t even know existed. He mentioned someone from HR told him I’d be getting one and suggested maybe I should share it with him.\n\nThat felt a bit off to me for a few reasons:\n\n1. Why is HR discussing my bonus with someone else?\n2. If the company wanted to reward both of us, they could’ve split it upfront.\n3. The person who referred me didn’t share their bonus with me, and I didn’t expect them to.\n\nI kind of brushed off the comment with a joke and moved on. But today, Mike messaged me again, saying the same HR person suggested I should take him to dinner with the bonus. For the record, I still haven’t even received the bonus yet.\n\nThe truth is, I don’t want to share it. I have home repairs and other personal expenses, and honestly, I find it a bit inappropriate that HR is making suggestions like this, and that Mike keeps bringing it up. I’m planning to make another joke and move on, but it’s been bothering me.\n\nWould I be an asshole for not sharing the bonus?",

      "scenario_description": "This all started during a Zoom meeting with my boss. We had just wrapped up the actual work we were scheduled to discuss when, out of nowhere, he asked me to volunteer to do the flowers for an event he’s on the board of directors for.\n\nI had already been invited to the event and was planning to attend out of respect for him, even though it wasn’t really my scene. But doing the flowers would’ve meant another three hours of unpaid labor. I live two hours away, so altogether it would’ve been an 8-hour day, and I wouldn’t have gotten home until around 11:30 p.m. On top of that, he expected me to get ready at his house, which I wasn’t comfortable with.\n\nI told him I couldn’t commit to it—that my time is worth something and I wasn’t in a position to volunteer. He pushed back, asking, “What else are you going to do to make money during that time?” I tried to shift the conversation, but he kept pressing. When I held firm, he slammed his laptop shut and ended the Zoom call.\n\nLater, he messaged me saying he was “extremely disappointed,” that I didn’t “deserve to be at the event,” and that it was for people who “help others without being paid.” He told me not to come, to finish my current work and send it to someone else, and that he was giving something he had planned for me to “someone who would appreciate it.” He also brought up that he had given me a work laptop and iPad—as if that meant I owed him free labor.\n\nNow I think I am fired even though I am a critical part of wrapping up a project. He hasn’t said it outright, but it feels like that’s where this is headed.\n\nHe’s on the verge of retirement, and after nearly four years of working with him, I had hoped to leave on good terms and use him as a reference.\n\nHere’s the kicker: I was supposed to take on a new project that I was really excited about—something I was going to lead under his supervision. That project aligned perfectly with my style and was honestly the only reason I was still committed to working with him. But he emailed the clients late last night and backed out, saying he’s ready to retire.\n\nSo now I’m left wondering if I’m the jerk for setting boundaries, or if I just got caught in someone else’s burnout spiral. AITA?\n\nUpdate: This morning “a couple of days later” my boss sent me a text asking if I could send him the invite list for the event he is throwing. Not acknowledging the argument. It is on a google spreadsheet that I have sent him multiple times before so I am not going to respond. ",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 31F and my mom (Brenda, 55F) and I are honestly pretty close. But there’s this one thing she does that’s been getting under my skin for years. Basically, if I tell her anything about my life, she’ll go and talk about it with the whole extended family. Like... everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins, even random relatives I barely know or haven’t seen in forever. Nothing’s too small—she’ll mention stuff about who I’m seeing, stuff with my job, health stuff, money stuff... just everything.\n\nI’ve told her to stop doing that so many times. Like I’ll say “hey, I don’t want anyone else knowing about this,” and she’ll nod like she gets it—but then later I hear she’s been talking. And when I call her out, she always says something like, “Oh, come on, it’s just family!” or “I wasn’t gossiping, I was just chatting.” Like??? That doesn’t really make it better.\n\nAnyway, not long ago I had this minor medical thing done—nothing serious, but definitely personal. I told her ahead of time, super clearly, that I didn’t want anyone else knowing. Just wanted to keep it to myself.\n\nThen like three days later, I start getting these “how are you feeling??” texts from a bunch of my aunts. And yep—turns out my mom told them. Again.\n\nI was honestly so frustrated. I called her and told her straight up that I felt like she didn’t respect my privacy, and that I was hurt she went and told people again after I asked her not to. I told her I need her to stop sharing my life like that—it’s not just casual chatting when it’s stuff I asked her to keep private.\n\nShe got really upset. Said I was attacking her, said I was overreacting and being cold, and now she won’t talk to me. My dad says I should’ve handled it “more gently” and that I made her feel bad. So now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far.\n\nWas I the asshole for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "A few times per year, my extended family gets together for a dinner; this includes my father's siblings and their children, my cousins. It's usually a good time and something I look forward to.\n\nLast time, I (31M) was sat in front of my cousin (32F), whom I'll call Nohemi. The conversation rolled around to marriages in the modern age, and how people our age get married either later or not at all. Nohemi opined that our generation's men were simply afraid of responsibility, and I said I disagreed. I argued that the whole institution was in a state of decline because of the modern, secularised concept of relationships, and I tried bringing up a paper I had read about the subject when Nohemi cut me off, saying in a somewhat condescending manner that \"not all of us have the time to sit around reading such papers all day.\" Ironic, because she's pursuing an academic career while I'm just a regular employee. \n\nIn response, I said \"Ok Nohemi, it takes two to tango, and I'm not dancing,\" basically shutting down the debate. Nohemi got upset and tried renewing it, making snide remarks I can't fully recall, but I only responded with \"Nohemi, you've *lost* me in this one.\" She then began complaining about how I discounted her 'lived experience' and how it wasn't fair that I wasn't willing to acknowledge her perspective.\n\nLater in the evening my father, who's always been the peacekeeper, suggested quietly that I go up to Nohemi and give her a conciliatory hug. I said she'd be more than welcome to approach me herself but that I wouldn't. ",

      "scenario_description": "I've been hanging out with a certain group of friends for multiple years now. We're very close and for the most part have had little to no drama. If there's one thing that's a little awkward it's the fact that I've been hanging out with my good friend (who I'll call S)'s old friend (who I'll call D) who no one in the group really likes for a couple of months now. We're very close and I've been having a really fun time with her. S and D had conflict in the past as S playfully insults her close friends (nothing too serious, just things like rat or pigeon) and it eventually started to make D quite insecure. They didn't really talk it out and haven't talked much since. Because of how S doesn't really like D, most of our group excluding me don't like her either, especially someone I'll call A, who at this point despises her more than S does. I was fairly close with D before starting to really get to know our group but we've been hanging out more and more lately. She doesn't seem very malicious towards my group or S, just quite remorseful. Recently A started to become more distant with me. It went on for a while\nbefore I confronted her about it. She told me that someone told her I said nasty things about her, but she was being very weird about it. I told her I would never and supposedly that was it until someone told me that she was lying, and she was actually mad that I had been hanging out with D. I asked her about it the next morning and she seemed relatively honest and brought it up. She didn't deny that someone had 'whispered rumours into her ear' though. We sorted it out to an extent, I told her they were always my first priority but that I wasn't going to stop talking to a friend I have been close to for many years at this point. She said fine and that it would just half to be a little awkward, but I was later told she was planning on telling me to 'choose' between them or D. However recently another girl in the group who I'm close to has started being distant with me as well. I talked to S, who I trust the most and am very good friends with, and she said that yes, she was mad at me. I thought it would just be a small thing, but it's been a while and she still seems pissed at me. I talked to S again and she told me that at the moment she wasn't entirely sure, but on earlier occasions she had been mad at me due to my interactions with D. It seems a lot of the girls in the group are mad at me for the same reason. I really love D and don't want to stop talking to her, but also really value this current friend group I have, especially S given that she's always been honest with me and is very sweet to me. Am I the asshole?",

But after my cousin moved in my grandma went to live with my dad and me my cousin stayed at her house. After about a year My Tia and Tio were getting a divorce things got messy and cops were called and my Tia wasn’t allowed home. For some context my cousin has never liked his dad and has never wanted anything to do with him. So following the divorce my Tia ended up living with me and my cousin. Fast forward to now after a huge ordeal she decided to get back with him even through she was almost done with the devoice. My cousin who had been there for her and had her back was very upset. Now at this point my grandma made it very clear regardless my Tio was not allowed at the house for any reason and my Tia went behind our back and snuck him over at 3:00am and the next day told me he was going to “just do laundry” and he ended up spending the night. So I told her that was not ok and was very disrespectful to me, my cousin, and my Grandma and reminded her he is not allowed here period. She sent a long winded message about not meaning to disrespect anyone and she talked to him and he understood he wasn’t allowed here after that. Then today when I get off work I see his truck here and she tells me he’s just signing paperwork so she can go back to her house and is also waiting for the water to get turned back on since he hasn’t paid the water bill. She wants him to stay till Monday when it gets turned back on and wants to keep it a secret so things can go smoothly. I talked to my cousin he says he’s ok with waiting till Monday but after that to kick them out and now I’m at a crossroads on what to do.",

      "scenario_description": "My paternal side of the family has always been very secretive about their grandmother, my grandfather’s mother. And by secretive, I mean no one even has a photo of her, and no one seems to know her name or what she looked like. I only found out about her through my mom a couple of years ago.\n\nWe had always assumed that our grandfather was an orphan, which is why we never asked much about her. Plus, we were just kids at the time, so it never really came up. In addition to that, they are also pretty racist towards Black people or anyone that isn’t from our country, so I never felt comfortable asking or talking about it (I tried many times to get them to understand that this is wrong, but they never stopped looking at black people in a disgusting way and they’re pretty old so any kind of discussion turns to a screaming match)\n\nAnyway, yesterday I was talking to my aunt, and I casually mentioned that my grandfather was half Black, which I probably shouldn’t have said since I only heard that from my mom (They didn’t tell any of us grandchildren anything about her, so maybe bringing it up was wrong). She immediately got defensive and insisted he was “brown” or “almost white.” Mind you, my dad and uncles had full afros, and my dad’s grandfather was a white man. When I pointed out that my grandfather was as dark as a ripe date and that my dad clearly had an afro, she got even more defensive and just said, “That’s normal. It’s just hair.”\n\nThis whole discussion started because she was disappointed that we had a Black cat. I wanted to show her the kitten because I thought she’d find her cute. Her exact words were, “Why did you take a Black cat? Disgusting.” So I responded by saying, “Well, your father was half Black. Was he disgusting too?” And that’s when she got defensive.\n\nNote: My paternal side has always had this attitude towards dark skin (some of them bleach their skin, others claim they were born white with green eyes and the rest never spoke of any topic that is related to being black).

      "scenario_description": "So, I've known my best friend since we started uni. I'm 23 and she's 24. We've been really close since our final year and she's just awesome, I love her so much. \n\nAnyway, recently I got married. I come from a family that encourages arranged marriages. And no, I don't mean forced. Arranged marriages in this context is basically being set up by family members. Both parties have to agree before an engagement occurs. My marriage was arranged. My husband and I are still getting used to this whole being married thing and still getting to know each other.\n\nBut my friend can be very needy. She constantly needs my advice or even just to rant to me about things. And most of the time this is totally fine. Especially before I was married. But now, I feel like this new step in my life has become a slightly greater priority. I don't have time in my day to be at her beck and call. I can't just stay out with her for five hours at a time just to hear out her problems like I used to. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I don't want to hear her out. It's just that it feels disrespectful to my husband to just spend so much time away from him when we've only been married for a short amount of time.\n\nAnd I feel so guilty we can't hang out as much as we used to but I thought it would be understood that we wouldn't be able to see each other as often. We met up for brunch earlier and I informed her I had to go straight home after our brunch as my husbands relatives were coming over to congratulate us on our wedding. She got quite upset about this. She said if I wasn't going to give my full attention to her problems, then we might as well just go home now. I told her that it's fine, we can still talk about what's going on but I just can't stay for the entire day like we're used to doing. Normally, we would have our meal and talk, then go in one of our cars and drive around talking for even longer. Today, that just wasn't feasible for me. I had guests coming at 5pm and I knew our brunch would probably finish at about 2/3pm. \n\nThe rest of the brunch was just awkward. It was obvious she was holding a bit of a grudge over what I'd said earlier. I made the mistake of asking her about it. She got mad and said I was choosing my husband over her. I told her that wasn't completely untrue, she's still my best friend but I have a husband and he's also a priority for me now. She didn't like that answer and asked if he was a greater priority. I told her that at this moment in time, he is. But that will change as we get to know each other and then we can go back to our long drives. She just got up and left after that. I've been wracked with guilt since. My husband said that maybe it was a bit harsh to say it like I did. He agrees that he has made me a greater priority since marriage too and it probably would be hard for someone who has depended on me for so long to hear that they aren't prioritised as much as someone who just entered my life. \n\nAita?",

      "scenario_description": "So me (26M) and my girlfriend (25F) were making her cake for her birthday party tomorrow and I said that's too much sugar its disgusting I cant eat that (I was even disgusted to touch it). She almost cried telling me that's not nice her sister was in front and said the same too.\n\nFor context she nows I workout and I dont eat sugar and avoid procesed foods and carbs apart from sometimes fruit and honey in general while she eats everything.\n\nI had told her I would eat a small slice for her but after seeing the amount of sugar she put I rather eat my sole shoe than that and its not about the calories but the whole idea of putting that food in my mouth disgusts me. I guess she should have made a cake I could eat with fruit honey and almond floor for example.\n\n-edit: so I wanted to make update.\nIm never critical of my girlfriend eating \"unhealthy\" even i usually get her a desert she has one almost every day. I will occasionally when I feel she needs it try to encourage her to eat healthier but not with a negative attitude like it happened here. And I apologize and thanks for pointing it out and I hope you do better than me in similar circumstances. I will definitely won't repeat this again.\n\nAbout the comments telling me I have orthorexia I think you are right although it doesnt sound bad to me I'm just different? Recently I made some changes to my diet I primarily eat raw animal organs like brain liver heart eyes etc. Now even cooked meat somehow disgusts me and upsets and bloats my stomach when I eat it it even tastes tasteless. So I can say very few foods I feel nice when I eat them and raw organs are one of those.",

      "scenario_description": "Me and one of my best friends are both late 30s. We've known each other for about 15 years now and ever since then she's struggled to keep a partner, because she was too self conscious and couldn't open up. \n\nI told her that I think she needs professional help, because she was downright paralyzed when she met someone she liked. She agreed, but never got help. \n\nSo the problem got worse and worse, she started to get more lethargic, stopped going out more and more, didn't go to the doctor although she had different health issues, stopped going to the gym and the latest problem is that she hates her job. \n\nSo for the last 4 years she's been telling me she wants to leave, she's looking for a job now, she can't stay there anymore ( the company really sucks and I absolutely agree, I wouldn't work there either). In those 4 years she's wrote one (1) application. \n\nShe constantly talks about wanting to do something different to what she does now as a job, but she doesn't know what exactly. But she also doesn't do anything about it. \n\nSo to sum it up: still no partner, because she is too shy and can't open up, even if she really really likes someone.( She was on tinder for like 4 years and didn't swipe right once, because she was too scared, she liked a lot of the men there but she just never did anything)\n\n Still no new job or even an idea of what she wants to do exactly. \n\nNo treatment for her health issues ( we have universal healthcare so money is not the issue) \n\nNo sports or gym for the last 4-5 years. \n\nHer apartment is always messy. \n\nShe complains about all these things almost daily, she's not happy like that but she just doesn't do anything about it. I told her, I think she is depressed, maybe she has an anxiety disorder. She agrees, she says she knows she has an issue and then: you guessed it- doesn't do fuck all about it. \n\nNow at that job it gets worse and worse so she complains more and more and in the last two days I came to end of my patience and I told her that I absolutely can't watch her destroy her own life anymore. I got really angry and I was brutally honest, that she needs to get fn help now, she's almost 40, she's just whining and complaining for like 10 years now and just NEVER DOES ANYTHING. that her behavior is pathological and that I absolutely cannot carry that emotional burden anymore. \n\nNow I feel bad about it but it is so incredibly exhausting. So AITA? should I have been more patient? \n\nEDIT: I told her many times that I think she has anxiety and depression, I even looked for therapists for her, I sent her countless articles or videos about being paralyzed in daily tasks, and she always says: yes I find myself in these diagnoses. But she never calls the therapists and I obviously can't do that for her. She still goes to work and she still meets with friends or goes out from time to time, so she's not heavily depressed. I think she has Dysthymia.. but if she doesn't get help for that, what can I do",

      "scenario_description": "I really need outside opinions because I don’t know if I am being super unreasonable.\n\nMy mum died when I was a teenager. In her will, she left the house to me but gave my dad a right to live in it until he dies. She inherited our family home from her parents so it was always just in her name.\n\nHonestly I never thought of it as “my house.” Even though legally it is. I moved away for uni but after I got a good job back in our hometown, I moved back in. I have been living here again for a few years now. \n\nI guess I knew deep down that my dad must have dated over the years but he never talked about it and never introduced me to anyone and honestly I kind of liked it that way. I didn't want to know that he moved on. It was just us- him and me against the world.\n\nHis new girlfriend kind of appeared out of nowhere. I met her a couple of times and suddenly she moved in without any prior discussion. \n\nI was stunned but I tried to be happy for him. I really, really did. I tried my best to be polite and keep my resentment to myself. But it’s getting harder every single day. Every time I see them giggling in the kitchen or cuddled up on the sofa my mum picked out, I want to scream. My mum who died too young, who loved my dad, who was only ever with my dad, who never got a chance to move on. And now I have to watch him do it, every single day, in her house, in her childhood home. I didn't know I just feels like this is so disrespectful to my mum's memory.\n\nShe is redecorating. She has moved furniture. She changed the curtains and wallpapers my mum and I picked together and reorganised the kitchen cupboards.\n\nAnd worse she has been making comments like, “Have you ever thought about living independently now that you are settled in your career?” Or telling my dad they will need to turn my room into nursery eventually when they have kids as the third room is his home office.\n\nLike. What?? The absolute audacity.\n\nI’m not a tenant or a guest. I own the goddamn house. My dad just has a right to live here but I don't think that right gives him the right to just move in a partner and act like it’s their shared marital home especially when I live here too. If he wants to build a life with her he should at least move out and not do it in my mum's home.\n\nFrom what i understand she has no legal right to live here. She is not a tenant as she pays no rent. I think I can legally kick her out anytime i want to without a court order. At best she is an \"excluded occupier\" and can be evicted with reasonable notice which is classed as one rental period. And I don't think even that is applicable here.\n\nI havent confronted him yet but I am this close to sitting my dad down and saying all this. And if he refuses, I am considering speaking to a solicitor and making it happen formally. I know it would cause a huge rift but i am so tired of feeling like a stranger in my own home. I feel like my mum is being erased. But I really love my dad and don't want to hurt him or lose him",

The walls in this place are ridiculously thin—like “you can hear a phone conversation word-for-word from the next room” thin.\n\nAnd yes, I know I irritate them when I blast my phone at full volume, especially right after they're done with their “business.” But honestly, I’m not trying to listen to them go at it every single night for two and a half hours straight, especially when I have things to do in the next few hours. It’s absolutely absurd at this point.\n\nSo tell me am I really the asshole for blasting music and turning up my phone just to drown them out? They seem annoyed, but I have every right to do this and ruin their \"vibe\" \n\nYes adults can do adult things in their own apartments, but I also pay the bills here as well, and I would rather have my peace and quiet. \n",

      "scenario_description": "I (24F) live in an apartment building and have a neighbor, Kyah (27F), who’s friendly but a bit careless. Over the past six months, Kyah’s borrowed several things from me tools, a ladder, even my Wi-Fi password when her internet was down. I didn’t mind at first, but she’s terrible about returning stuff. My screwdriver set is still missing, she kept my ladder for weeks until I asked for it back, and she used my Wi-Fi for a month without offering to chip in for the bill. Each time, I’ve been polite and let it slide, thinking she’d get better about it. Last weekend, I ran into Kyah at the grocery store. She was at the checkout with a cart full of stuff but realized she’d forgotten her wallet. She asked if I could cover her $85 bill, promising to pay me back that evening. I hesitated because of her track record with my stuff and because I’m on a tight budget myself. I told her I could spot her $20 for essentials but couldn’t cover the whole bill, especially since it included things like expensive snacks and beer. She got frustrated, saying I was unneighborly and that she’d have done the same for me. She ended up leaving most of her items behind and only buying what she could with the cash she found in her pocket. Since then, Kyah’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and another neighbor said Kyah called me stingy. I feel bad because I know forgetting a wallet is stressful, and maybe I could’ve helped more since we’re neighbors. But I also feel like her pattern of borrowing without reciprocating made me wary. \n\nAITA for not covering her full grocery bill?",

      "scenario_description": "I recently invested a significant amount of my savings into building a high performing PC for gaming and my studies, as I do graphic design, and need something powerful for this, as well as obviously playing games and such. I spent months researching parts which I needed to build it, and even longer saving up for it, as I only have a part time job, because I am young. I built the PC, bought all the peripherals and everything I needed and was super proud of myself.\n\n  \nRecently, when we were having a family gathering at my house, my 9 year old cousin, (We'll call him Leo,) saw my PC, as he must've got into my room while we were talking, asked to play on my 'cool computer,' since he mainly plays on an iPad. Don't get me wrong, I'm fond of the guy, but I didn't want him using my computer for multiple reasons, like if he breaks something, I can't be replacing it, as like I said, it was very expensive, and he might've misunderstood the fragility of the PC, I also worried that he might accidentally alter or delete my coursework, getting me in a load of trouble. \n\n  \nI would also have had to supervise him while he was playing because of his age, which I didn't want to do, as it was a family gathering, and I wanted to spend the time with the family I don't see very often. \n\n  \nSo I told him no, and he was pretty disappointed, which he made VERY clear to his parents and mine. His parents understood my perspective, but they obviously took Leo's side. They said that I could have let him play for a few minutes, and that I should have been more flexible. They also said it's 'Just a computer,' and that 'family should share.' The 'just a computer' part really annoyed me, as that is months of work for me, lots of consideration and care into buying and making it.\n\n  \nI offered to let Leo play games on my console if he wanted to play anywhere, but he was stubborn and said no, just to prove a point. So now Leo's parents aren't happy with me, and mine told me to just let it go and go to my room, I received a text from my aunt saying that I was being annoying, stubborn and unkind, and this hurt me. AITA?",
