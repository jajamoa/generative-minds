      "scenario_description": "Hi Reddit! Sorry if my english isn’t too good, it’s not my first language. Anyway, here is the backstory of the issue I have:\n\nI (19F) am spending my gap year living at home with my parents. It was fine until two months ago, when my sister (29F), who lives abroad with her boyfriend and 3-year-old daughter, agreed to leave the child with us so she could go to kindergarten here.\n\nWhile excited to have the baby home, because I knew the situation with her parents was, for lack of a ‘nicer’ word, unfortunate, I set some boundaries for my parents, including the fact that I will not be putting my life on pause to be a babysitter, because they were the ones who wanted the baby home so bad.\n\nMy niece came home with major developmental issues: she can’t speak properly, throws tantrums constantly, doesn’t respond to her own name, lacks motor skills, and has severe separation anxiety. She’d wake up from naps crying if alone and scan the bed at night to check who was there, which we suspect is because she was often left alone or with strangers.\n\nHowever, through all of this, we managed to do some work on her. We weened her off the pacifier, significantly lowered her screen time and actually taught her some words.\n\nIt wasn’t all that great, because my mom has moved into my room with the child, claiming her own room is too small and that my dad snores (so does she). Meanwhile, my dad, a two-time father, acts clueless about parenting and just spoils her, then leaves the hardship to me and my mom.\n\nThis week, my sister, her boyfriend, and her random friend showed up and undid everything. They gave her electronics when she cried, let her play in the sink unsupervised, ruined her sleep schedule, and started using pet names instead of her real name once again.\n\nWhen I try to enforce any kind of routine, I’m the bad guy for not letting the child do whatever it wants.\n\nMy parents also expect me to drop everything. I’ve canceled plans with friends because they needed someone to watch the child so THEY could go out. I’m constantly scolded for wanting to live my life.\n\nToday, my dad told me they’re going to a wedding this weekend, and I’ll have to stay home with my niece and my sister’s friend, who’s still staying with us for reasons I don’t understand. Apparently, they don’t want to leave her alone because she’s a POC and they’re worried she’ll steal something (yes, it’s racist).\n\nNo one asked if I had plans. I do btw, I’m supposed to go on a date. And I’m not canceling it. I myself have been raised by my grandma (RIP) and one of our neighbours. My mom worked late, and my dad worked outside the city for weeks. They figured it out then, they can do it now, too.\n\nI’ve already done so much for this child. I love her, but I never agreed to be a parent or a therapist or a babysitter. I feel like no one respects my boundaries or my time and they all just think I’m selfish.\n\nSo my question is AITA for refusing to keep helping raise my niece?",

      "scenario_description": "I (31f) asked my cousins wife ‘Elenor’(37f) to be my bridesmaid. My aunt ‘Mandy’ is her MIL. My cousin is Dan (41m). Mandy isn’t well and for the last year elenor has been complaining about her to my mom. Saying hurtful things about the state of her health,hygiene and house etc, going after all aspects of her. \nLast year Mandy got a bad diagnosis and spend time in hospital. It was a hard year for her and when Christmas came it was a chance for all the family to be together and celebrate etc. but elenor and Dan were barely around over the Christmas period. mom spoke to Dan and was honest about how we all felt about that, as well as the hurtful things Elenor was saying about her. that evening Elenor started texting my mom. She accused my mother of having mental problems and said she needed to go see a psychiatrist. She said i wouldn’t look after her in her old age the way they look after Mandy and just a whole load of stuff attacking mom. It was very civil on moms side but Elenor seemed to be on a rampage and it was like she wasn’t reading moms replies. Mom tried ringing her and Dan as she felt it wasn’t a conversation to have over text but she wouldn’t answer. Mom was really upset by the end and dad tried calling Dan too but he wouldn’t answer. Ever since then the family have gone low contact but keep the peace for the sake of Mandy. \n\nElenor has been ok with me and did come on my hen party(what we Irish call a bachelorette party). We all thought she wouldn’t show up considering what she said to my mother. I didn’t uninvite her at the time at mom’s request, we were worried if I uninvited them it would upset Mandy and she is our main priority. \n\nNow to today’s incident. Mandy’s condition has worsened and she now has different carers coming in for a few hours every day to help her. She gets on really well with her Saturday carer ‘Jane’. She looks forward to her day with her. Well last week Jane had been called into a meeting with her supervisor and was told she’s not allowed work with Mandy anymore. Turns out someone reported her for taking money off Mandy. She didn’t take any money off her though. She would sometimes pick up bread or milk, basic shopping for Mandy and Mandy only paid her what it cost. Mandy was really upset and wants her back but Jane isn’t answering her calls. Another one of her carers showed her a letter the supervisor had sent to all of Mandy’s carers. It said they’re not to do any shopping for Mandy, that her son does her shopping for her. So it was Dan and/or Elenor that had reported it. Neither of them do her shopping by the way. Mandy is really angry and upset over this, they knew how well she got on with Jane. We think that they did it on purpose to get rid of the nice carer as they don’t want carers coming in, they want her to go into a nursing home. Elenor said as much in the Christmas texts. Mandy is going to confront Dan about it.\nSo basically, am I the asshole if I uninvite her from being a bridesmaid?\n\nEdit to add: he’s admitted he did report her, he saw her in the Ring doorbell camera with a bag full of stuff and assumed she’d stolen it. It was a few Easter eggs that Mandy wasn’t going to eat and gave to her. She’s told him she’s adding my mom as joint power of attorney with him so he and Elenor won’t have sole control. Waiting to see if Elenor reacts!",

Your family drama, regardless who is right and who is wrong, would seem to be a good enough reason for Jane to step down.\n\nBefore acting based on your assumptions about what Dan and/or Elenor may have done, double check with the agency that provides Mandy support. It's quite possible that the agency has policies that very clearly spell out what can and what cannot be asked of the caretaker. It would be wise to get a list of those services before assuming too much since it is possible that Jane had exceeded the agency's policy and that she was reported by another caretaker of whom Mandy made a similar request.  \n\nI'd be surprised if Mandy's son and DIL had the authority to tell the Mandy's care agency who can and who cannot help her to buy groceries; typically, such direction comes only from the person doing the hiring. If I were Mandy, I'd contact the agency and ask them to walk back that directive. I'd also tell them that she (Mandy) and only she can tell them what services her caretakers can provide to her.",

      "scenario_description": "I 36M, have a son, Leo (15M). He mostly lives with his mother Kristy and her husband, Randy, as we thought it would be best for him to live in a more traditional home environment. Still, he visits often, especially when school's out. He's a great kid, social, good with school, sporty. Lately, though, I've been noticing that he's always worn out when he gets home to me.\n\nLike he’ll come in and just sit on the floor of his room with the lights off, or fall asleep at the most random times. He says Kristy's place is just a 'little tiring' at the moment. Stuff in his room got moved around, the light keeps flickering even after he turns it off, and his stepsiblings are being louder.\n\nUsually, he doesn't come to me during the term, but Monday, he called me, upset, and asked me to get him. I got an uber to pick him up immediately, while I took off work to go meet them. (I called Kristy to tell her this was happening btw I didn't just kidnap our son)\n\nHe didn’t say much when he arrived and was still in his uniform. He hugged me, went to his room, and shut the door. I checked on him and he was just lying on the carpet in the dark. Eventually he told me Kristy sprayed strong scented spray through his entire closet, bed, and curtains because it 'smelt like a locker room'. Leo is sensitive to smells and the clothes were so strong, he couldn't hold them to his face, let alone put them on. I obviously got him a change of clothes, and got him some food.\n\nThen I called Kristy to ask what the hell was up. Leo has always had a thing about strong smells, I think its genetic or something, so my fault. Kristy said in the real world that some things are just going to smell. I said he manages fine at school and during swim training. He just wants comfort. in his own room. Making him uncomfortable on purpose doesn’t teach anything.\n\nShe and I got in a fight and I told her Leo would back when he wants, and I’m not going to pressure him. She says I'm enabling and disrupting his schooling over 'clothes-smell'. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Some context, my(29f) aunt(45) we'll call Monica is my aunt by marriage to my uncle(45) we'll call Frank. Multiple family members have had issues with aunt in the past.\n\n  \nCrazy Example - Monica got into a fight with my cousin's friend (this cousin we'll call amber is my other uncles daughter) at a family party. Friend was dancing with my cousin (Monica's son(25m)) we'll call Carl during a time he had just left his baby momma. Aunt was drunk grabbed the friends hair saying she was his girlfriend (YES SAYING HER OWN SON IS HER BF) and the friend is a hoe etc., etc.. Amber stepped in and went off on Monica (obviously for good reason). Amber no longer talks to Monica and barely talks to Frank.\n\n  \nFast forward to me announcing my pregnancy of my first baby I decided to announce on Mother's Day since all of the family was going to be together. When I arrived, I was saying hi to everyone, I went to hug another aunt(51) we'll call Lily. When I hugged Lily, she made a joke saying, \"happy mother's day\" to me, I gave her a crazy look and in that instant Monica starts saying \"I feel like Lily spilled the beans\", I denied it. Lily honestly had absolutely no idea, it's not uncommon for her to joke around like this. \n\nI was going back and forth with still announcing because I had a feeling Monica would say something dumb, and I should've trusted my feeling.\n\n  \nWell, I get my phone propped up to take a \"picture\" of the whole family, I set it to record. I said I set it for a countdown. I then say, \"I'm pregnant!\" Everyone barely reacting then BOOM!!! Monica starts screaming \"I knew it! I knew it! Lily already said!\" I turn around so quick and say firmly LILY DID NOT KNOW JUST STOP. The moment is ruined everyone is now paying attention to her and trying to tell her to stop. She doesn't. I start to cry because I'm so upset, and she just keeps going. \n\n  \nNow I am beginning early planning for my baby shower, and I can't help but want to not invite Monica nor Frank. \n\n  \nSo AITA? Am I overreacting? She technically is family, and it would cause more drama. ",

There’s an available car space and I pull in and there’s no way anyone else could fit behind me! I was between two bigger cars and needed to get into my boot to get my pram out! I’m waiting for the group to start, letting my baby sleep a little longer! Get out of the car and the resident of the house calls out to me having just returned home! \n\n‘You should be considerate of where you park’\n\nMe - the space was free so I took it, I’m sorry! \n\n‘I have health conditions and I struggle to walk far distances’ \n\n‘I’m sorry truly, I’m sorry!’ \n\nConversation ended, my friend arrives and we head into the group for over an hour! I return to a very horrible note left on my car from said lady that read:\n\n‘I hope you realise one day when you need consideration that you receive the same smirk as you gave me when I asked you to show a little thought for others! It’s called karma!’\n\nI’m a passive person, hate confrontation and honestly in that moment of her calling me out wanted to get in my car and leave! I don’t know if she wanted a fight or what she wanted out of it and I’m not fast on my feet when confronted like this ! I don’t recall myself smirking and it could have been a natural response of myself ‘shutting down’. I think I was in disbelief that this was happening! She could have knocked on my car window and asked if I could Move so she could park out the front but the spots aren’t marked for residents it’s a public street and she waited me out to speak to me but did so from her front step! I’m truly a considerate person and I find if it’s respect from both parties there’s no problem.\n\nI give her the benefit of the doubt that she could be having a bad day but she’s also lived in this street long enough to know that these things happen and she may be inconvenienced! \n\nLike am I in the wrong or is she being entitled and she’s being ageist towards me? And if she’s done it to me then has she done it to others? \n\nWhat would you have done or said in this interaction? Offered to move and please them? Or would she have still had a bee in her bonnet? Like am I truly the asshole in this situation?\n\nMy partner is petty and said he would have gone and parked his Ute there all day or have returned the letter to her! ",

I spent the entire morning elbow deep in trash to sort it for recycling, while they were doing *remarkably* less disgusting things like mopping the floor, so let's just say that I wasn't exactly ecstatic to begin with.\n\nAt some point I went upstairs to grab the rest of the trash bins and accidentally startled one of A's dogs, who started growling at me and being aggressive. This dog is a MASSIVE rescue who is very easily startled over nothing and can become aggressive. I don't mind the other two cause they're basically freaking statues, but allow me to say if I need a fucking semestral safety training to approach your freaking dog who can't handle people, maybe just fucking leave him home???\n\nAnyway I had to barricade myself inside an office and call him upstairs and I had to tell him a couple times to hold the dogs. Apparently I sounded a bit too nervous while saying that, and he started ranting that he just didn't hear me the first time (to which I apologized cause I didn't realize) and that I, quote, \"need to stop being a bitch to him\". He then proceeded to spend the following two hours mocking my nervous tone and just generally treating me as an idiot.\n\nAfter all this I was pretty upset, and at some point I was crying (that's just how my body responds when I'm nervous, I literally cannot help it) and yeah, I admit I was getting more and more nervous so I went outside to calm down. My mom asked me what was going on, I explained her the situation and asked to be left alone to cool down, so of course she didn't and started pestering me about it and saying I should just let it slide and be chill and giving me all sorts of passive aggressive suggestions I didn't ask for, which obviously only made me more mad.\n\nI wasn't even that fucking mad with A, just expected some kind of apology, especially seeing that I DID apologize to him for my tone and that it was HIS fucking dog who got aggressive with me over nothing. But no, my mom says that *I* owe them an apology for how I reacted because they're adults and I have to be more respectful and because \"that's just how A is\". I won't fucking apologize for this, I don't think I didn't anything wrong, I communicated my emotions and was open about how I needed to be treated, they didn't respect a single one of my boundaries, got mad when I didn't react the way they wanted me to, and expect me to be fine with it because I'm younger?? No, fuck that.\n\nThat's my opinion at least, so am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR, my mom's coworker's huge dog snapped at me for nothing, I got nervous, and now they're demanding an apology for getting nervous instead of apologizing to me for treating me like shit about it.",

I thought that I was missing an important bit of information to this post. As things stands, what I'm seeing is:\n\n* Human accidentally startles dog.\n* Startled dog reacts the way that startled dogs often react: aggressivley.\n* Human reacts the way that human often react when facing aggressive animal: fearfully and calls for help.\n* Dog's owner behaves like many dog owners behave which is disbelief that anyone could be afraid of their dog who wouldn't hurt a fly. Having met many of those owners, pardon my eye roll.\n* Shitstrom ensues.\n\nAs is too often the case, these events escalated because people (and the pet) reacted emotionally and instinctively, not because any one person necessarily did anything wrong.  If anyone is owed an apology -- or at the very least a box full of Scooby snacks -- it's the dog for being startled, even if it was accidental.\n\nNAH",

      "scenario_description": "So I (26F) was supposed to be a bridesmaid for my friend’s (27F) wedding we used to be close in college but haven’t really talked that much since then. I honestly was kinda surprised she even asked me\n\nPlanning was a disaster she was micromanaging every single thing and kept acting like we were all just accessories in her aesthetic she wanted us to have identical nails and lashes and like I get wanting a vibe but I said in the group chat I wasn’t doing long fake nails since I work in healthcare and she got mad and made some comment like “then maybe you’re not a fit for the bridal party” so I said “maybe I’m not” and I guess that was that\n\nFew days later she texted me saying she was taking me out of the wedding party but I could still come as a guest which tbh felt kinda humiliating especially after I already bought the dress shoes and paid for alterations. Over $350\n\nI asked if I could still wear the dress to the wedding since it’s not like I can return it and she said absolutely not she doesn’t want anyone wearing that dress unless they’re in the photos and didn’t want “reminders of negativity” at her wedding \n\nSo I didn’t go\n\nBut yeah two days later I wore the dress to brunch and posted pics and tagged the store it was definitely the same dress and same color scheme she used for the wedding so our mutuals realized it and I guess it got back to her\n\nShe sent this whole thing about how I was being disrespectful and intentionally trying to ruin her vibe and I was like ??? it’s a dress I paid for and it looks good\n\nSome friends say I had every right, others say I clearly posted it to stir the pot which I didn’t the dresss was expensive and the brunch was very formal and I needed a dress and I had it so i wore it \n\nAITA?\n\n\nupdate: I just wanna clarify a few things, I do have other dresses I could’ve worn to the brunch but none fit that theme, person who hosted wanted light colors all my other dresses are dark green, red, black, some just white. I only had the light blue dress that was bought for the wedding. I originally didn’t even plan on going to the brunch but decided last minute since my girlfriend wanted to go and wanted me with her. \n\n\nsmall other update/clarification: the dress wasn’t from a wedding dress store it was a normal mall store think zara or H&M, that’s what i tagged not a bridal shop store. \n\n\nlast update: good to know I’m not the AH lol, as for the situation I’m just going to let everything pass and not entertain anyone including my now ex girlfriend don’t know why she was so upset on behalf the bride but whatever. Im done with all the drama this has all drained me badly. Thank you to all the people who commented didn’t think it would reach 10 people let alone 400+ ",

      "scenario_description": "I 22F haven’t had the best relationship with my dad in years. The closest we had to have a relationship is when we both lived in Virginia so I was able to see him more. I’ve lived with my mom all my life. As I got older the more our relationship strained. I’ve blocked him on multiple occasions for the things he’s said to me or about my at the time boyfriend 22M (even though he hasn’t taken the time to get to know him). My stepdad had been in my life since I was 10. Now growing up we didn’t have the best relationship either. At times to felt he was trying to take over as my dad and I didn’t like that. I would paint him as the villain even though he did his best to love and support me. Me and my fiancé have been talking about getting married for a long time. He’s just been waiting on the right time and he’s saving for a ring. We’re decided to do a courthouse wedding to make things easier. My fiancé been asked my mom about this and I told him he had to ask my stepdad for his blessing cause it’s tradition. That’s what he did, he called my stepdad and asked, he got the blessing. I posted it cause it was a happy moment, but my fraternal grandmother made a comment saying I should’ve asked my dad.  I don’t regret having him ask my stepdad, but I want to hear others opinions.\n\n\nEDIT: A lot of yall seem to miss the point of the post. 1. I’m not asking if I’m the a-hole for having my fiancé ask my stepdad. 2. I’m asking if I’m the a-hole for having him ask my stepdad and not my dad. 3. A lot of yall are choosing to ignore the fact I said my fiancé asked my mom for her blessing first (he did it Oct 2024) way before this conversation happened. 4. I wasn’t having her my stepdad’s blessing as a way to get his permission because I don’t need his permission. I only did it cause I thought the gesture was cute. I don’t care for the actual meaning of the transition.",

I'd make more plans with my GF to avoid hanging out or I'd \" forget\" hangouts or make up reasons not to sleep over. A few days ago Martin confronted me about how weird I'm being.

I have been telling my close family all the details from the beginning incase I lose this baby as well.  I wanted to wait to announce to the world, but my grandmother kept pestering me about just letting her tell everyone since she's \"so excited.\"  It made her visibly distraught when I told her I wanted to announce to the world on my own terms.  \n  When I finally announced to our church she was upset I hadn't allowed her to do it earlier because I'm \"already getting big enough to notice.\"  \n  Now, we found out the gender last week and I told her this morning I wanted to wait to announce to the world.  I didn't want a gender reveal party, but I still wanted to be able to tell everyone on my own terms. \n  She didn't care for my answer and told everyone in our church (we have a VERY small town/community) the gender this morning when I wasn't around.  Church members just began walking to me saying congratulations on baby's gender!  My sister saw I was obviously distraught and told my grandma to stop telling people which upset her more.  \n  Now I feel I can no longer share information about my baby without her going behind my back and telling everyone every little detail.  My father says I am overreacting because \"this baby is all she has.\"  She already has three other great grandchildren she was nothing to do with.  \n  AITA for not wanting her involved in my progress anymore?  I just want information released when I'm comfortable to.",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway also, English isn’t my first language, so sorry if anything sounds off. I just need an outside opinion.\n\nMy friend Beth recently turned 18 and had a birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant. There were about 15 or 20 of us. She is really close with two girls, Lia and Kat. They have been best friends for years and have this very intense, no-boundaries type of friendship. They go through each other’s phones, eat off each other’s plates, that kind of thing.\n\nI met them last year when uni started. I am not used to that. Even with friends I have known forever, I ask before I touch their stuff or try their food. \nThe trio teases me for this habit & they say I am too formal.\n\nAt dinner, Lia, told everyone to order whatever they wanted and that it was all covered. I asked if she was sure and she said, “Me saying it is the same as Beth saying it.” It felt a bit off, but I let it go.\n\nI just ordered a Coke and shared some of what was on the table. I asked Lia if I could get a beer and she gave me a weird look and said, “Idk” So I asked Beth, and she said I could but that her parents do not like alcohol, so I would need to pay for it myself. I said that was not a problem but still was getting dirty looks from Lia (maybe she wanted a beer too but didn’t want to pay idk) so ended up not ordering it to avoid more awkwardness.\n\nMeanwhile, Lia and Kat kept ordering a lot of sushi. I love sushi too, but for a group that size, it did not seem practical. I just ate whatever was already there.\n\nLater, I saw Beth sitting with my friend Millie and she looked really upset. Her mom had called and was angry because the bill was much higher than expected. Beth said Lia went overboard with the ordering and now she had to deal with it. I felt really bad said maybe next time she could plan a set menu or do the ordering herself. We stayed with her, comforted her, and tried to help her feel better. Lia was across the room laughing acting like nothing happened.\n\nThe bill got paid and we all left. Millie and I just gave each other that look like, “That was wild,” and moved on.\n\nA few days later, Lia sent me angry texts. She said Millie and I were stirring up drama and trying to come between her and Beth and ruined her rep infront of Beth’s parents. She also said that if we felt so bad for Beth, we should send her mom the money.\n\nI was honestly shocked. We did not say anything bad about Lia. We just tried to be kind when Beth was upset.\n\nI told her no. Respectfully, we are broke uni students & we were not the ones telling people to order freely.\n\nNow everything is awkward and tense and I hate it. I want to sort it out, but I do not think I should be blamed for all of it right? Sorry if this all sounds like petty high school drama.\n\nShould I have just paid to keep the peace?\n\nTL;DR: Friend’s birthday dinner got out of hand. I barely ordered anything, comforted her when she got upset, and now another friend says I caused drama and should help pay. I said no. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Essentially..\n\n  \nMy wife and I have been on great terms. No issues. My wife recently had an issue with her superiors at work where she harassed my wife, calling her names and making her look terrible in front of her colleagues. She's unionized so she's in the process of submitting a harassment letter and complaint. She is extremely stressed out about this. \n\nOne night, after putting my kids to bed, I go straight to my computer to do work. My wife comes down after and says \"Suppertime. Can you put the boxes away from the door before you go on your computer?\". I tell her, \"It's not that bad.\" I proceed to walk to the doorway and point out that there's a lot of space and there is no tripping hazard. She exhales disapprovingly and says that his is ridiculous. I tell her, \"Well, if this is an issue, then this box shouldn't be here in the first place. I never placed it here, you did.\" She says, \"I didn't have any place to put it when I was walking in with the kids.,\" \n\n  \nThis is where I'm visibly annoying, because 1. she came in hot after I just started to relax. 2. She was the one who placed the box there, no me. I know she is annoyed because 1. she has mentioned it to me before, to make sure the area is clear when I come down... maybe once or twice a while ago. And she's still anxious from her interaction with her superior. \n\n  \nSo she's sitting at the couch a few minutes later, while I am clearing up the entire front area. I am muttering to myself because I am so pissed saying \"this shouldn't be here... this shouldn't be here\". Throwing away all of the junk that was left here from the family including her - because they are all hazards. She hears me say the word \"shit\" or \"fuck\" (because I am a potty mouth and I can't help it) and she gets up and says I can't take this! And goes to the bedroom. She texts me I don't want to talk about this today or tomorrow, just make sure the place is cleared and don't argue with me. \n\n  \nFlash forward a few days later, we are cordial but I am feeling the residual tension brewing when I am with her. She said not to mention it earlier so I say nothing. She brings it up - and tells me how disappointed she was the other day. I knew how anxious she was but I insisted on arguing with; and I know how she didn't like my swearing. I tell her I am sorry, but deep down, I know she was the one who put the box there in the first place, but I apologize for my swearing.\n\n  \nI plan to go to therapy to find out ways to reduce my anxiety during situations like this. Am I the asshole in this situation? I feel like she is painting me to be the badguy. ",

He’s a super anxious boy. He doesn’t like car rides, stairs, new places, sometimes new people. He gets extremely overwhelmed when he’s out of his comfort zone. \nI feel like when I pet sit for him he has a good routine and gets better by the end of my stay. \nMy friend has a 3 year old, her partner, two cats and a new bearded dragon. They live in a townhouse with a large community. It’s three floors, the dog only stays on the first floor because he’s afraid of stairs (or at least Woden stairs). \nI’ve been trying to figure out why he’s so anxious, I believe there’s usually a reason for this behavior which could be house they’re living or a traumatic event. \nI have a feeling he isn’t on a good schedule, doesn’t get proper exercise or stimulation. \nOn the other hand, I feel like I might be over thinking. \nAlso a side note to kind of illustrate how my friend and her partner operate. They ran out of animal food right when they left, ran out of poop bags and don’t know where their pooper scooper is. \n\nMy sister and I also shaved off two matted sections of hair behind his ears. He has long golden hair, I’m not sure how long/common it takes for those to form. \n\nShe’s also never had a dog before and I’ve had one my whole life pretty much and have pet sat many many dogs. \n\nAITA for communicating some of this to her? I really just want him to be a happy dog and I feel like her can with the proper care. \n\nI’m unsure if anything would actually change by telling them and make them feel really judged.

      "scenario_description": "A little background I 44F have always helped and defended my mom 67F in any situation (arguments she started, divorces etc) I began hearing stories from multiple people that she was degrading me as a mother and daughter years ago ( identical stories). I married my husband 7 yrs ago together 10 yrs and from the start he’s always felt if we’re together it’s his place to help with anything mom needs ( borrowing cars if hers messed up, rebuilding her car engine, buying her tires etc) he was raised that’s what you do. ( Not to mention he’s took care of me through multiple heart attacks and surgeries) My mom in her previous divorce has spent 15 yrs saying how she wasn’t treated like family bc she was a stepmom by her exes family. Fast forward to now. He helped raise my youngest 2 children who are doing great ( daughter married with 1 amazing child and son joined the military like he’s talked about since he was 15 yrs old). 2 yrs ago she decided against my daughters wishes she was going to have our grandsons ( extremely close to my husband)1st bday party on a weekday when everyone was working and some worked late and/or lived out of town. I let her know there’s no way we could be there bc he works so late. ( I couldn’t drive myself I’m legally blind) She proceeded to tell me “it doesn’t matter if he comes he’s just a stepparent”. This ruined any respect I had for her. Listening to her complaints for years of being treated that way and she said that to me. I calmly informed her we will not be there and I will NEVER put up with my husband being treated like this. My mom has always had a belief all truck drivers are cheaters and abusers (she put up with that out of her exes) even though my spouse is none of those things. She has accused me of elder abuse for not answering her calls and told my daughter by text she wasn’t going to include me in her will bc I “put my husband before her”.  I saw the message that included how to instructions on how to disown me through her will. Of course my alcoholic pill abusing snl said myself and my daughter were lying and I was a no good mother and I was only trying to cause trouble by letting my brother and sister know what she was sending around and that I didn’t want them to think I hold any anger or anything towards them in any way just bc my mom and I weren’t speaking. (No leave her alone stop attacking people over something you’re not involved in or anything from my brother). I have continued to receive guilt tripping and hateful messages from my mom for 2 yrs now while sending messages to my daughter messages trying to get her to take her side at the same time. So I’m asking AITAH for standing up for my husband and my beliefs after she decided he’s “just a stepparent” after all he’s done?",

      "scenario_description": "My bf(41m) and I(35f) have been together for 4 years...sorta. We got together in Fall 2021. In the Summer of 2022 I found out unexpectedly while he was on vacation that he was actually not only with his family but his ex-wife. His excuse was that his mom invited her and he didn't know how to tell me but I also found out he paid her part of the trip. We split. He went to therapy and after around 7-8 months we got back together. She continued to show up at family functions and I stood my ground and asked that he asked her to not attend anymore.(Its weird right? Even if you are close to the family.) Fast forward to now, he recently had a procedure that required a hospital stay. I was with him during and went home after to let him rest. I planned to return early the next morning. The next morning I received a message from him that his mother and niece were coming down to see him and I could wait until later that after noon. Shortly after his mother calls after and updates me that she is also bringing the ex-wife, and tells me that I can be civil. I have never, not been civil. I called him and asked if he knew she was coming to which he replied \"I didnt want to hurt anyones feelings.\". I am hurt and furious. Hurious? I am supposed to pick him up from the hospital this afternoon and bring him home. If I just dont show AITA? ",

T and S liked each other about 4 years ago but they don’t have anything towards each other right now.\n\nS’s Bf (calling him C) and her have now been together for 3 years and C is still jealous that T hangs out with us. While on the trip C called S and started having an argument with her about how my bf was allowed on the trip and he wasn’t. For some context my bf has known my family way before we were dating and was invited by my uncle, on the other hand, no one knows C and S doesn’t want to tell our grandparents just yet. So he couldn’t come.\n\nThey argued for approx 2 hours (I was sharing a room with her so I heard them arguing on the phone) and in the end he broke up with her.\n\nThe reason C gave was that he was still jealous and insecure that she was a trip with T and that he wasn’t allowed to come. He even told his family that he was breaking up with her.\n\nS was crying uncontrollably and I was trying to console her but it wasn’t working. The day after that we went home and to make S feel a little better I thought I would take her to dinner. But as soon as we got home she decided to leave and go to convince C to take her back.\n\nIn the end C took her back and said you can’t hang out with T. But she wasn’t hanging T unless she had to cause he was in the group, hell she didn’t talk to him at work (S, T and I work together).\n\nIk this isn’t my place to give advice to her and tell what do but we live in a country where it is very hard to gain citizenship and we are citizens but C is not and ever since they started dating he has shown some toxic signs like not letting her go out and stuff like that.\n\nI told her to have some self respect and not go back to him if he acting like a baby over her going on a family trip. This isn’t the first time he has done this as well. I gave her the advice not to go back to someone that broke up with her.\n\nMy grandparents are very conservative and want us to get an arranged marriage so our parents have decided not to tell them about our relationships. They don’t know about my relationship as well but as I said they’ve know my bf’s family for a long time and don’t read into when he’s out with us\n\nAITA for this advice?\n",

      "scenario_description": "My(26M) mom(60F) called me and let me know my cousin(27F) is getting a divorce. She just told her husband and already she told my mom about a guy she is interested in. My mom set up a video call between her and the guy and is trying to set them up. Here's the issue. The guy is my sister's ex husband. Idk his exact age but he is 11-12 years older than her. He married my sister and met my cousin when she was 10. I told my mom it was super creepy and disrespectful to my sister and my cousin's husband. She said they never really even knew each other while she was a kid. I told her that didn't matter. So AITA for telling my mom she was being disrespectful, overstepping in other people's lives, and supporting a creepy relationship? She text me saying that she just wanted to love and support my cousin and that she wasn't trying to promote the relationship.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify some things.\n1. My cousin and sisters ex husband are both aware my mom wants to set them up. My cousin is on board and my sister's ex is considering it.\n2. I didn't want to get involved. I am asking AITA for telling my mom she's overstepping. I didn't want to get involved my mom called me unsolicited. \n3. I don't have an issue with the age gap. It was the fact they met when she was 10 and he was 21ish and that my cousin jumping into something while still married with my sister's ex husband. \n4. I am not asking if I'm in the wrong for my opinion I am asking if I'm in the wrong for what I said to my mom. My issue was that she was getting too involved. My issues with anything else are for context.",

F) and she apparently said yes and has been taking care of her grandma for a few months now. I found out yesterday that he’s been paying her! I was mad because I would’ve said yes if I knew I was gonna get paid. She made a post about this and wasn’t fully honest. She called my grandpa her grandpa and he’s not. Her post got removed because she can’t follow directions which makes me wonder if she’s actually taking good care of her grandma. Plus, my grandpa fell so many times with her there.

Now he is paying me 1k a month and he has started dating my sister, 27.\nI know it was stupid to let him borrow that much money but I believed him when he said that he was going to pay me back.\nI have kids, m 7 and f 6. And when my now brother in law borrad all that money my kids father could have taken my kids from me because I didnt have any money.\nMe and their father has started dating again.\nNow to the point. We are invited to my grandmother who is selibrating her 70th birthday.\nThe thing is that I dont want to see my brother in law. What he did hurts and my family thinks that I should just be quiet and dont talk to him. \nThey are talking a lot about their feelings and it doesnt feel like they care about my feelings.\nI want to celebrate my grandmother but I can do that an other day. \nMy mother said that if my brother in law isnt going to come bc of me then my kids father should not go as well. I have never try to make him come, my grandmother wanted my kids father to come bc we are dating and he is the father of my kids.\nI have told my mother that she is alowd to bring my kids.\nI dont have feelings for him, I love my kids dad, and I dont care that he is dating my sister but AITA for not going? My family thinks so.",

There is nothing magical about that one date that says you have to go.\n\nHowever, you have no business trying to dictate who else should be invited to family events that are in celebration of your Nan's 70th. If your sister is dating this man and if, as a result, he's been invited as her plus one, it's not yours to veto said invite.\n\nIf you go, it's up to you and to everyone else who is going to behave like adults, to be polite to each other, and to refrain from showing dislike based on past and current conflicts. If you can't/won't do that, don't go.",

      "scenario_description": "TLDR; I don't want to give a wedding gift because I was left out from wedding events. \n\nBackground: My cousins moved abroad when they were young. There was some unexplained drama between our parent's generation and it was mostly not spoken about but we kept the peace for our now deceased grandparents. Moving abroad definitely was part of the drama, but from my POV I have no beef with my aunt (by marriage), uncle (by blood, deceased), and cousins. Whenever they told us they were in town we always made sure to get dinner and catch up.  However, it was always obvious they were much closer to the other side of their family that also lives nearby. \n\nSituation: They invited all the families from their father's side to a wedding in their home country. I was on the fence because of cost and the fact that I don't feel particularly close to them. It required a tux rental and additional travel after arriving to the country. It was a wedding that requires a lot of effort on our end. But surprisingly we all attended. \n\nThe invitation (which was an email to a link) only gave an agenda for the wedding day and the hotel arrangements. Nothing mentioned about events the days before and after. But it was a fully fledged wedding web page. However, after we arrived we learned there were events the day before and after which we couldn't attend because of our travel plans. This was absolutely no where on the web page. We later learned that the arrival event went much later than it stated in the agenda. No one ever reached out to us to let us know people were gathered together. We all have IG, emails, cells...\n\nThen the day of the wedding my aunt-in-law and cousins including the bride and groom barely made any attempt to talk to us. I was always the one that approached them and they always seem to have a reason to walk away. I can't think of a single question any of them asked me - not even how was the flight. My aunt I only saw in the hotel lobby for 2 minutes. I don't think any of them spoke to my partner at all. Listen I know weddings are busy, but I would think you would make some attempt to catch up especially since we weren't at the other events, and traveled the furthest of anyone. Not one of them said goodnight at the end of the night. And that was the last I saw of them before leaving the next morning. The  funny thing is I had really nice meaningful conversations with their cousins on the other side of their family, and friends of the bride.\n\nI definitely don't think they wanted us there and didn't think we would come. We didn't attend two previous weddings in this family, but I never even got real invites to them.\n\nQuestion: WIBTA if I didn't give a gift? The wedding invite said \"your presence is gift enough\" and I'm thinking about taking them up on that.They'll get a nicely formatted PDF email attachment thank you, similar to the invitation I got. Maybe I'll include an invite to dinner if they ever decide to let us know they're in town. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (F30) recently lost my dad. My sisters and I are due to receive some money from my dad's estate. I brought up with my mum that my younger sister (27) recieved a financial gift from my dad last year to help her with the cost of driving lessons and the purchase of a car. I was told at the time that I would get the same amouny towards the cost of a car when i bought one. My mum told me to raise this with my sisters as they had both been given financial help from my dad with buying a car and I hadn't, due to not having started learning. I brought this up with them today and asked that I receive this money from the estate. They said that it's not their fault that my dad passed away before I started to learn how to drive and I dont have any claim to money I was promised. I responded that it was unfair that they had both received the money and that I should be paid this out of his estate. They disagreed and said that I couldn't make claims to be owed this, with my older sister (35) saying that as she learnt to drive when she was 17, it was ridiculous to even bring this up (my sister was given a car and driving lessons as a gift when she turned 17, however, 5 years later when I turned 17, my family was in financial difficulty and couldn't afford to do the same for me and so I didn't learn. I then went off to university, moved abroad, moved back to the UK living in a big city and always used public transport so driving wasn't a priority. As i get older i want to learn for when I have kids - hopefully in the next 5 years)\nThis disagreement led to a huge argument and my older sister storming off and calling me names. This feels quite obvious to me but they're of a very different opinion and its causing rifts in our relationship. AITA?? ",

      "scenario_description": "Sorry if this is messy, I’m still pretty mad right now. I (27M) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for the past year. We work together, so I moved in to his apartment a couple months ago as well. Things were going good we went on dates and all the other stuff. There has been a big problem though.\n\nI have loved bicycling ever since I was a little kid. I used to bike to work and it was the best part of my day. When I moved in though he was very against the bicycle. He said it would make his rug dirty (fair enough I guess) and that there wasn’t enough room. So we kept it in the garage. I wanted to keep biking to work but he really wanted to drive with me so I stopped biking. No huge deal though.\n\nBut a week ago I Ubered back (he had left work early) from a 14 hour shift only to see my bike GONE. I freaked out, thinking that someone broke into our garage and we weren’t safe. I ran upstairs to tell my boyfriend what happened and he looked at me for a long few seconds before telling me that HE selled the bike! He said it was just taking up too much space (there was literally room for it in the garage), and that he would buy me a smaller one later.\n\nYou guys, I have had this bike for seven years. It has literally been with me through thick and thin. I admit this may be where I’m the asshole, but I flipped out and started screaming at my boyfriend. Nothing too mean but just like “how could you do this, that wasn’t your bike to sell” etc. Things got ugly when I threw my (paper) plate full of pasta at him and he started crying.\n\nI apologized but he said he needed some space and went to bed. I needed space too and things have been civil but cold between us since. Im still upset about how he selled the bike, but I recognize that I might’ve overreacted. Also, he lets me live rent free so technically it is his place to call the shots on. I dunno, what do you guys think?\n\nNOTE: the plate did not hit him, I just threw it in his general direction.",

      "scenario_description": "AITA or are my family in the wrong?\n\nAITA?\n\nThrowaway account.\nI (40M) am widowed for the past 5 years. I have 4 children and to help with my children, I have had au pairs and childminders help out. I have always treated them well and never had any issues. \n\nMy mother has been very helpful but we have a complex relationship. She constantly gossips about me and my siblings to each other. She has done this for as long as I can remember. She was in my house 2-3 times a week so I could go to the gym or workout. I am an executive in a medium sized company so I work long hours.\n\nLast December,  my latest au pair (24F) confessed she had feelings for me. I wasn't long out of a 2 year relationship at that point and I was uncomfortable with the age gap as well as the dynamic in my home so I told her to park it.  She went home for Christmas and I didn't see her for nearly a month. When she came back, things went back to normal. However, I confess I did develop feelings for her. In late February she said her feelings hadn't changed and in her words \"She is a grown ass woman who knows what she wants\" and the age gap doesn't bother her. \n\nWe began a discreet relationship. Or so I thought. I don't know how but my eldest son found out. My mother suspected something too and my eldest son told her. My mother went nuclear and told all my siblings what had been going on and that my kids went to her because they were extremely upset about this. This is l despite me asking her to respect my privacy and allow me to handle it my way. My mother was shouting, making insinuations about both my au pair and me. \n\nMy siblings have all effectively cut me off and I was uninvited to my brother's housewarming after he got his new place. Two of my siblings have told me they are tired of the way I've been treating my mother and one accused me of being verbally aggressive to her and shouting at her, even though it was actually the other way around. \n\nMy two sons have since told me that my mother would regularly criticise me and my parenting style to them and would facilitate them giving out about me. I keep a strict control of their (M15 and M13) social media. I also ensure they help around the house and they have set chores to do. \n\nMy mother wants things to go back to the way they were but I don't trust her. I'm also very hurt by my siblings' responses. None of them ever contacted me to ask my side of things and have simply accepted my mother's version as the truth. \n\n\nI know people will have strong opinions about my relationship with the au pair but for the purpose of this post, can I ask for guidance and views on my relationship with my mother and siblings? Any advice would be welcome. \n\n\n\n",

One the one hand, you do have a right to privacy. On the other hand, that right ends when it creates a sense of mistrust and of lying to your own children. She is not just their  au pair; she is now your lover. At some point, you should have just told them what was going on in your (and by extension, their) lives.  You must realize the role of your secrecy in getting you into trouble with your own children.  If you haven't done so yet, you need to fix things with them.\n\nAs regards your mother's incessant gossiping about you and everyone around her, that is simply unacceptable. NTA for cutting her off and going n/c with her.  You should contact your own siblings -- at least those who will still talk to/with you -- to explain \"your side\" of things.  Just remember that your side includes secrecy which, at its root, set you up for this dynamic.",

      "scenario_description": "In January I joined a new handbells group. A friend of mine warned me about the director but I didn't listen to ber. It was obvious at the very beginning she was not a fan of me. While she criticized me for small things and treated me as a neuisance. \n\nShe consistently shouted at the group and insulted us.\n\nShe also playes favorites. There was a part in one song that two women got wrong every single time without fail. And they got nothing more than a reminder. \n\nI on the other hand, grabbed a sharp instead of a natural, realized, switched bells before we even got to that part and didn't miss a note and she shouted at me for not being prepared. Shouting, storming her foot, a full on tantrum. \n\nIf course, I stood up for myself and told her that she had absolutely no right to speak to me that way and that I would not be disrespected like that for what was essentially nothing.\n\nAfter that she would make passive aggressive comments towards me as well as glare at me. I couldn't back out because that would leave the rest of the group (who were wonderful) stuck.\n\nJust recently, she sent out emails about getting together for fall and I sent her a text saying \n\n\"Hi (name). You can take me off the email list. I won't be playing with your group again. Your actions and attitude towards me and the others were very hurtful and disrespectful.\"\n\nI know it was a bit much but I was upset. Yes it wasnt kind but it wasn't like I insulted her. Just straight to the point. What I was not expecting was her response. \n\n\"... I hope that you will spend some time reflecting on your actions (and in actions) and how in some cases your actions were very disrespectful to the group and to me. You acted as if you were the best ringer in the group and frankly your technique is less than stellar. South County strives to have consistent technique, and you were holding us back. Handbell choirs are unique in that if one person is not functional, then it handicaps the whole group. I hope that as you mature you will gain a better understanding of what it means to be a part of a handbell ensemble. \"\n\nNot only did she insult me, but went on to call me a handicap!? Of course she never had the balls to mention any of this while we were ringing because she was probably afraid I wouldn't sit and take her crap and would stand up for myself\n\nHostley, I want to copy  her email and send it to the whole group but I know that would only make me seem like an ass. Not sure how I should respond \n\nI don't think im the best ringer, infact there were some there who were much better than me. And my technique was fine, it's not like I was dropping bells or something. And it's not like our standards were high either. \n\nThe issue is I spoke to my friend she she said that it was necessarily cruel and her response it justified cause I was mean first. \n\nTLDR: Told my director I didn't like how she disrespected me. She proceeded write a paragraph about how awful I was.",

      "scenario_description": "I (26F) have a sister, “Amy” (28F), who has always had a difficult relationship with food. She was bullied as a kid and turned to food for comfort. As an adult, she still struggles with self-control, especially around things she finds appetizing. Our parents have never set boundaries with her around food, and that’s carried into adulthood—she currently lives with them, and they do all the grocery shopping and cooking.\n\nMy husband (28M) recently had a birthday, and I planned a surprise party. I sent him out of the house for a few hours so I could set up and asked my parents to come help. I specifically asked them not to bring Amy setting up involved putting out snacks, drinks, and a homemade cake with frosting.\n\nThey showed up with Amy anyway, saying it wouldn’t be fair to exclude her. I gave her a few small tasks and specifically asked her not to touch any of the food until guests arrived, but I was too busy to keep a constant eye on her.\n\nAt one point, I went into the kitchen and found Amy with the fridge open, eating the frosting out of the mixing bowl. She had eaten nearly half of it. As soon as she saw me, she burst into tears and said she only meant to try a little but couldn’t stop.\n\nMy parents heard us and came in. My mom said it wasn’t that big of a deal since the cake was untouched and I still had enough frosting for a crumb coat, but I had planned to do specific cake decorations, and now there wasn’t enough frosting; I didn’t have the time or ingredients to make more. My dad suggested going to the store to buy a tub of pre-made frosting, saying it was the same thing. I explained my husband tries to avoid a lot of the ingredients found in store-bought frosting and wouldn’t want that. My dad said to just not tell him since he “wouldn’t even know the difference“. \n\nThat suggestion was super frustrating to me. I told my parents that they couldn't convince me that this was no big deal, and that they had allowed this by not setting boundaries with Amy’s binge eating and by bringing her to set up. They told me to back off and be more sensitive to my sister, and that it wasn’t her fault. I responded by saying that I was more angry at them, because at least Amy felt bad while they were trying to downplay the situation. \n\nThey got upset and said it wasn’t fair to blame them for Amy’s choices, and that she was an adult and they can’t control her. They also said that they were trying to help by giving suggestions, and that I was being stubborn by shutting all of them down. They ended up leaving, and now they’re giving me the silent treatment, even though Amy has apologized for eating the frosting. AITA for involving them in this?",

      "scenario_description": "I am going to start this by saying that my daughter has been smoking for a very long time and she knows how I feel about it and she knows that the smell bothers me. We do live in a state where it is legal for 21+ behind CLOSED DOORS on PRIVATE PROPERTY not in close proximity to minors. When I go to her home, I smell it, but I don’t say anything to her about it because it’s her space, she can do what she wants, but my husband and I don’t allow it in our house so she almost never comes over because she knows I’ll say something if I smell it on her or her kids (my grandkids).\n\nNext month my husband and I are having an anniversary party/ birthday celebration (both of us turn 40 this year) as well as a vow renewal. We had a courthouse wedding right before Covid so we never got a chance to celebrate with our friends and family like we wanted to so we decided to do one big celebration now. When we first started discussing what we wanted, I said I would like it if our kids were able to stand with us during our renewal. I have my daughter, his son, and our daughter together. I asked the kids if they were open to do that with us and they all agreed and so we made plans and had discussions about what I would like them to wear and whatnot. \n\nLast week, I called my daughter to confirm that she had everything under control as far as what she was going to wear including accessories and during our conversation I had made the request that her and her husband refrain from smoking while at the park were having the party at. She became very upset and started to yell at me asking if I was planning on restricting anyone from drinking alcohol and my response was that we are not providing any alcohol to anyone so if they bring it and drink it I can’t stop them. She then told me that she doesn’t know how long she will be staying then if she won’t be allowed to even go to her car to smoke. Again it’s not even LEGAL to use in public spaces like the park. My husband works for the police department and he’s invited a few of his friends from work so there’s that as well. So am I the asshole for asking her to refrain from smoking for one day?\n\nI feel like I need to clarify a few things:\n1) No she does not use weed for medical purposes. It’s recreational for both her and her husband.\n\n2) She has been told that she can have edibles, but please keep them in the car for a few reasons which include not being obvious that she’s consuming something in front of the police chief. \n\n3) My husband is the one who set up with the park manager for us to use the space and said we can have alcohol. If it turns out we can’t, then we will deal with that then. \n\n4) IDK how this turned into a “you were a teen mom so it’s no wonder you kid is so screwed up” post, and not that it’s really anyone’s business, but it’s not my fault that I was a teen mom but I did what I could and waited until I was in a committed relationship before I had my second (and last). \n\n5) The only time that I have ever said anything to her about the smell was when she was a minor (under 18) and when she comes into my spaces (my house, car, etc). Otherwise I deal with it. It gives me a headache and makes my stomach turn, and I’m sorry but I really don’t want to have to deal with that on my day",

      "scenario_description": "I 35M have lived in Texas since 2017. I built a close, friend group, most who I met through church. One of my closest friends, Han 32M moved here in 2018. We quickly became friends & then roommates. Nia 37F also moved here around that time. She & Han eventually started dating in 2019.\nNia’s always been rude, & I used to chalk it up to cultural differences, but it got bad over time. She drinks more than she can handle, & when drunk she does things like tug on my shirts in front of people & try to take them off as a joke. She ripped a few of them. I was annoyed but didn’t make a big deal out of it. Others were put off by her behavior.\nThe situation blew up during a solar eclipse gathering in April 2024. I had taken the day off, picked up breakfast & donuts for everyone, & bought eclipse glasses. Nia came out of Han’s room as the eclipse started & yanked the glasses off Han’s face while he was staring directly at the sun. I told her, “Get your own pair,” meaning pairs I left by the door. She threw the glasses back at Han & stormed off. I didn’t think much of it. Later that day, she grabbed one of the pastries I brought & I joked, “No none for you,” in a tone that we’d often used in to joke. She shot back something snarky, but we all laughed. I assumed everything was fine.\nMonths passed, & while at dinner with friends, I asked her a question & she ignored me. When I asked again, she snapped, in a tone that made everyone go quiet.\nLater that night, I asked Han what was going on, & he said it was about the day of the eclipse. I offered to apologize & talk to her about it, but he told me to let it go & that it would blow over. Out of respect, I stepped back from group events to give her space. But it didn’t help. It just isolated me. \nIt’s been over a year now. I stopped being invited to things & it feels like I am being pushed out of my group. I’ve fallen into a depression over this because I feel like I lost my closest friend & my entire community with no chance to work things out.\nRecently, things escalated. She finished her studies & can’t live on campus anymore. Han & I are still roommates & clearly she was now living at our house. I asked him directly if this cold shoulder from Nia would go away? He thought about it, then said no. Likely never would.\nSo I told him that I’m no longer comfortable with her being at the house when he’s not there. I explained that it’s not about when he is home too. Just when he’s not there. I can’t trust someone who acts the way she has been since I’ve purchased almost all of the shared home items.\nHan understood & agreed. But since then, he’s been avoiding me. He’s been leaving for work earlier than usual & getting home later.  We used to come & go around the same time daily. Now, it feels like he’s dodging me.\nSo AITA for setting that boundary & saying I don’t want her here alone anymore? I tried to keep the peace, gave it time, & even distanced myself to avoid drama. At this point, I’m just exhausted.",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 28M and my sister is 29, when we were kids our parents separated for while like 2 years but got back together later on, during that period my dad got a random women pregnant. I can barely remember it being a thing but we were so young it didn’t have too much impact in the long run. \n\nWe’ve never spoken to him except as we were growing up he’d follow us on socials and would try to start conversations with awkward Happy Birthdays we entertained him until he tried to ask for money one time so we kinda ignored him since. \n\nI don’t think anybody in our family has really kept up with him including our Dad except maybe our Aunt who’d give us random updates about him here and there pretty sure he’s 23 or 24\n\nAnyway my Dad has unfortunately passed somewhat unexpectedly but he was an older guy, don’t want to get into it tbh. But It’s been about 4 months since and me and my sister have been staying at his house that’s passed to us and figuring all the other stuff out \n\nWe recently got a formal letter from the HB’s lawyer (which I’m pretty sure is just his friend but that’s besides the point) asking for his portion of everything, so we were practically forced to meet with him where he gave us a sob story about how he needed help and a place to stay or he’d take us to court. So basically forcing our hand to make a choice soon.\n\nI think it’s ridiculous to let a stranger basically into our home and lives like this but the alternative is selling everything if we were forced to give him stuff. My aunt says I’m being an asshole and that he’s no different from a distant relative at worst but I feel like he has bad intentions or something and honestly I think it’s wrong for him to swoop in and lay claim to a place he’s never step foot in and ask help from people he dosent even know I bet he’s been waiting for this for a while now. Anyway what do y’all think?\n\n\nIf you need info ask feels like I’ve been typing forever jeez\n\nEdit/update - Sorry got busy, but unfortunately there’s no clear will left behind, but we did find out that my mother had paid many of the mortgages on the house so much much more ground to stand on. \n\nEdit 2 - SO MANY COMMENTS, I think I’ll do little mini thoughts and update type things just on my profile also to just write down my thoughts without subreddit restrictions. Maybe after everything is over I’ll drop a final update in this sub we’ll see (I’ll try to reply to some mrle comments on here ",

My own mom passed after the age of 100, so I speak from experience of tolerating people who, under normal circumstances, I would ignore.\n\nAssuming that our parents are not toxic people who should be cut out of our lives (i.e., assuming an otherwise okay relationship with our parents), we need to give them the benefit of the doubt and, as much as possible, gift them with peace of mind once they hit the age of 90. While partly about respect, it's also about recognizing that they are in their twilight years and that stress involving their loved ones is the last thing that they should deal with. It's time for us to put on our adult clothes and to celebrate their few remaining milestones. It means studiously ignoring and/or being stiffly polite with other family members who have done more than annoy us; their conflicts with us are not our parents' concern any longer, if ever they were. \n\nIf you don't want to go, don't go. Do something else to celebrate this rare milestone in your mother's life. If your children opt to join you in that celebration, so much the better.\n\nHowever, what you should ***not*** be doing is forcing your mother to choose between inviting you versus inviting her grandchildren's mother. That would be a major A\\*\\*H\\*\\*\\* move.\n\nYour post is dangerously close to crossing that line. So I vote for YTA.",

      "scenario_description": "I (27NBi) have been in an argument with a friend (31F) for about 3 months now.\n\n\n\nFor background, we both help another friend home school her 11 year old son. I'm currently studying my Master of Teaching. My friend, we'll call her Emily, teaches art classes on the weekend.  I'm teaching the child English and HASS, Emily is teaching art and her partner (32NBi) is teaching maths. The goal was to get him re-engaged with education.\n\n\n\nEmily was used to teaching people who had paid to be there. She didn't know how to teach someone who didn't want to be there. She would basically tell him if he didn't he would have a consequence.\n\nAt first, I tried to tell her gently that her approach won't help him learn. She kept brushing me off, so I started to get more direct. She started shutting me down harder.\n\n\n\nAbout 3 months ago, she said in the group chat that she had told the kid he was being \"manipulative,\" and he got upset. Her partner commented that manipulative can have neutral and positive connotations, to which she agreed.\n\n\n\nI said that manipulative is a word that is generally negative. Emily wrote: \"OP. It's sorted. We've moved on.\"  I said that while it's sorted this time, what about next time? I said that it was shitty she was blaming the kid for everything, while refusing to look at her own behaviour. It ended with Emily calling me cruel for coming in with anger and insults and told me to \"enjoy my moment.\"\n\n\n\nAt 10pm, I got a message from Emily. It was about 5 paragraphs long, telling me that I had been bullying her for months, giving her small comments about her appearance. I remember telling her if her lipstick smudged, or if her shirt was undone. Things that she had expressed she'd prefer that I tell her. She also said that I was criticising her teaching.\n\n\n\nI responded to all her points, basically saying I felt she was being unfair for not telling me about the insults and deflecting from what I've been trying to tell her about her teaching.\n\n\n\nI said I'd like to see a councellor. She said \"if you feel it's necessary.\" I said I do, because I don't feel like she's open to listening to anything I'm saying. She said she's not, and she was worried that I was just going to brush off all accountability. I said ok, I'm done. There's no moving forward if her voice is the only one.\n\n\n\nLater in the week, she sent me a message saying that she didn't say that she was against counselling, only that she only wanted to do it if I thought we needed to. She's not against hearing me, but first she needs me to go to therapy and get control of my \"anger issues\". I said I don't meet the definition of anger issues. She said I did.\n\n\n\nThat was 3 months ago. In that time, I've seen therapists and all of them suggest cutting her off and moving on. We've been friends for the last 10 years and she's the cornerstone of one of my main friend groups. WIBTA if I did what I said in the title?",
