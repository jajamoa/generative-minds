      "scenario_description": "My husband and I have been together for 20 or so years. He’s a genuinely good man, great husband, loving parent, loyal friend. I feel fortunate that we are still in love after all this time. We have kind of a bestie vibe going, we really like to do things together whether it’s errands, shopping, cooking, impromptu adventures. Sometimes our teen is along with us but sometimes not as he has a growing social life. \n\nWe had dinner out tonight and when our enjoyable meal was over and we had paid the check, he got up from the table and walked out, leaving me (and our leftovers) at the table. I’m always slightly slower to get up. He does this a lot and it really bothers me. Am I wrong to want him to stand at the table and wait two seconds so we can walk out together? Also when we are out together or as a family he will often walk ahead of me instead of next to me, for example when we get out of the car in the church parking lot on Sunday mornings and walk to the church, I’m often left trailing behind. I have long legs and I’m not a slow walker. \n\nI’m not ugly or weird or embarrassing, and he’s not some degenerate who doesn’t know better. So what is this about? When I’ve brought it up casually in the past he brushes it off or deflects, but I now feel like we need to have an actual conversation about it. AITA here? And how do I go about broaching this without having to deal with an overly defensive reaction? \n\nUPDATE: I really appreciated all the comments, ideas, and feedback. When I brought this topic up the next day it did not feel particularly well received and I was frustrated with myself for not being more articulate and with him for not being more open to conversation. I chalked it up as needing to be revisited in the near future. \n\nBut we went away overnight with our son two days later and I stopped counting examples of changed behavior at 7 or 8. From checking in to the hotel to walking around town, dining out twice, walking to the beach & back multiple times, we walked together, he held doors, and even said to my son at one point, “hang on, we’re going to wait for Mom.” And my dear teen, without any prompting at all, scooped up leftovers of something he and I shared at lunch before we left that restaurant. \n\nI did thank my husband repeatedly when he waited a beat for me… some verbally, some with just a smile. If this lasts I’ll be thrilled and he does not seem to mind one bit. ",

Another possibility is if he doesn’t want to wait for containers, etc. If he doesn’t take his own leftovers, feel free to leave them.",

      "scenario_description": "I really need help with this. Some background before the events of this week:\n\nI (17NB) just graduated. I live with my Mother (31F), my Bonus Mom (31F) and my 3 niblings. I've been living with them for around four years since finishing the last of 8th grade -> highschool. My Mother and Bonus Mom are my Bio sister and her wife respectively but since living with them I've grown comfortable to seeing them as my parents.\n\nMy Bio Mom (56F) and I escaped a abusive household when I was around 13. We went down South and we lived with my (now) family.\n\nThe plan was that she would go start school like she wanted to (My Bio Mom has never actually gone to school past first grade). After that, my Bio Mom would get an apartment and I'd move in with her.\n\nInstead, my Bio Mom meeting her current fiance on tinder. (Not sure of his age except for being late fifties).\n\nBio Mom decided she would take a week-long trip with him around 2021 late summer. The night before my first day of high school, two weeks since my Bio Mom's trip, my parents broke the news to me that my Bio Mom was actually going back with her boyfriend and living with him and his daughters, giving full custody to my (now) Mother. Since then she only visited once during my Freshman year on Christmas. \n\nSince then it was really, really fucking hard for me to experience life without her and deal with the fact she essentially abandoned me to live with another family. It's caused fights and was only exacerbated by the fact I was able to text her or call her on only specific occasions when she had data/wifi.\n\nNow onto the events of yesterday and today: \n\nYesterday I came home from work and my parents told me that my Bio Mom, on Sunday, texted them that she was trying to surprise me by having visited Monday after work. Appearantly she's on another trip and her Fiancee has family down here South but the way times lined up she wasn't able to get to us Monday, but she's coming today around 12-1pm. I was rightfully shocked and not happy at all because mind you, she didn't go to my birthdays, graduation, didn't say anything on prom. Worst of all my Mother is going through a rough pregnancy and the due date is around July so it's painfully obvious Bio Mom's trying to see her grandbaby. \n\nMy family is all upset. My Mother suggested I busy myself, make it painfully obvious I don't have time for her/her antics, because we feel like she may try and convince me to come back with her. I'm actively looking at apartments and colleges to attend, too.\n\nI feel like I would be the asshole for ignoring her and being really busy aside from my job because she's my biomom. She still raised me as best as she could. If not for her I'd still be back in Pennsylvania and totally *miserable.* \n\nI really want to be open minded here and not let my resentment cloud judgement of her but I'm not sure if I'm right or if it's just teenage dramatics. \n\nSo, WIBTA for ignoring my Bio Mom as she visits? Any answers and general advice is really helpful. ",

If it makes you extremely uncomfortable to be around her, then avoid her.\n\nThis sounds like a \"drop by\" visit, not a \"move in and help with the newborn for a few weeks\" kind of visit.  If she hasn't had any contact or involvement in the last 3 years, most likely she has no idea how it will go either, and is maybe trying to \"break the ice\" looking towards doing more in the future.  I would be very surprised if she wanted you to move back with her when you're almost 18.  More likely she wanted one last visit before you disappear off to college and your own life. \n\nSince she wanted to make it a surprise, that may be because she's worried that you wouldn't want to see her.  The plus side to that is, if you have work or other plans you have an excuse to cut the visit short.\n\nI'd suggest you keep those plans in place, but be open to canceling some of it if the visit is going better than you thought.",

      "scenario_description": "To start this off I'd like to say that this is an online friend, and people I personally know are encouraging me to post this. \\[To clear up some confusion the \"joke\" was him \"adding rules to the group chat\"\\] So, I recently became friends with someone who called himself Toastie. We met through a server on discord over a shared liking on a game, and after a few days of knowing each other He added me to a group chat with his boyfriend-Bako, and a few others. Everything went smoothly with everyone joking around for a few days, as group chats of friends do. I got to know everyone on the first day and most of us at least shared a few interests. I came to realize that Toastie is rather irritable towards other people than Bako. I was in a side conversation earlier (at the time of writing this) and someone I know that was not in the group chat asked how many people were in my friend group. So, I sent an image of the group chats title.\n\nAfter a while I forwarded a message of the person that I sent the screenshot to that was addressing a joke that was in the group chats title. One of the members of the group chat, Dingleberry, questioned it, assuming that I had sent it. I then sent a screenshot of them sending the message. Toastie soon came in saying \".\", followed up by \"you told someone about the group chat?\" and I said yes, not feeling the need to lie about something that minor. Toastie soon told me to add them in a non-joking way, saying that \"I added rules to the group chat and that's one of them.\" I found that a bit odd, saying \"jit, what?\" and that just spiraled into Toastie calling me names, saying that no one needed me in that group chat, and that I was \"a lafufu\" (?). We kept arguing and Toastie soon kicked me out. He explained that \"it was a joke\" when he said that. I didn't believe that due to him typing like that when he was annoyed with someone else in the group chat. Am I the asshole in this situation for arguing back with an alleged \"joke\" that Toastie said?",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (31F) is staying with me temporarily after leaving her husband. I (30M) have a small apartment but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she’s six months pregnant. I wasn't very pleased about this situation but she is my sis afterall.\n\nThe main issue has been food. I’m pretty disciplined about what I eat because I am in bulk stage and hitting the gym regularly. I portion things, label them and plan for the entire week. But every other day something’s gone. Makes me crazy.\n\nShe’ll drink all my expensive shakes, polish off meals I’ve prepped for work, eat snacks I’ve saved for post run, and even finish leftovers I was planning to turn into new meals. When I bring it up, she shrugs and says things like “Cravings hit hard” or “Hormones” or \"You are being mean\".\n\nI asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. Or hell, manage her own food for god's sake. She refuses to do anything about it.\n\nSo last week I ordered a small mini fridge and set it up in my bedroom. It’s just big enough for my meal prep, snacks and drinks. I didn’t make a scene about it. I just quietly started putting all my stuff there.\n\nShe noticed two days later and got pissed. She said I was being “childish,” “dramatic” and “treating her like a thief.” I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights.\n\nNow she’s sulking and has told our parents after her failed marriage, her brother is also alienating her. And she is just a burden for everyone. My mom called and said I should “pregnancy isn’t easy” and especially for her situation.\n\nI don’t think I’m being cruel. I’m still letting her live here rent-free, and I’ve even offered to order food or cook together, but I just want my food to be left alone. A part of me understands she is going through trouble. But, at my expense?\n\nAITA?",

I was so happy for her and made sure she had everything she needed to be comfortable on the day. At my bridal shower, she decided to announce her pregnancy, despite being only about a month or 2 along. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to make a scene, but I got quite a few questions about how I felt about it from the other bridesmaids. A few months later, at our rehearsal dinner, she decided to “quietly” announce the gender to some of the family at her table. Their reactions caught the attention of the other guests causing her to make an announcement. Because the rehearsal dinner was only a small group of the immediate family and bridal party, she asked if it would be alright to announce it at the wedding since many friends and family would be traveling from out of town and she could let everyone know at once. When I asked her to wait until after the wedding  events were over, she got pretty offended and didn’t talk to me much for the rest of the night. At the wedding, there was no big announcement the news definitely got around. AITA for telling her to wait until  after the wedding to announce it ? ",

      "post_title": "AITA for yelling at my father for making a bold statement about my antidepressants",
      "scenario_description": "Yesterday at around 4:45pm I (18F) came home from a pretty long day of work followed with a very drawn out psychiatrist appointment. I was understandably pretty burnt out since my boss had been giving me crap all day, and my psychiatrist would not stop asking me questions (which is her job , it just got to be a very long, emotionally exhausting discussion). \nI came home with my Prozac refill and I set it on the counter to use the restroom as I hadn't yet that day. I spent a while in the restroom brushing out my hair and getting ready for bed. I was pretty spent, and my last task of the night before I got to go to bed was filling up my pill organizer. (For context, my father has been bugging me about moving out for quite some time even though I've only just graduated.)\n\n When I went out into the living area to get my meds, I saw my father very deeply analyzing the label on my pill bottle. Upon asking him what he was doing, he proceeded to tell me that apparently the dose was, 'too high for someone who could get up for work everyday without problem' (which isnt true). I told him that he didn't know if I got up without problem or not because he was usually gone by the time I had to get out of bed for work. The conversation escalated pretty quickly into yelling from there. I told him that if he ever listened to me, he would understand that even on antidepressants, I still struggle to do basic tasks and get out of bed at times, and he told me that, 'that kind of behaviour is just from me not being productive enough' (which is an incredibly low blow since I've had depression since middleschool and have always struggled with productivity). It morphed into us throwing insults back and forth, and my mother stepped in, and told me I was ridiculous for yelling without reason. At that point , I had already given up and gone to my room.\n\n I assumed waking up this morning that the interaction would be forgotten about , but when I went out to make myself breakfast,  my father was sitting on the couch just... starting at me. I asked him why he wasn't at work, and he told me it was because we 'needed to talk'. He then proceeded to tell me that I, apparently, was too emotional being both mentally ill and a teenager to be living in my home any longer. He told me that I either had to start paying rent to live at home, or I had to move out by the end of the year. I am completely torn on my decision, and I'm beginning to genuinely question if I was being too sensitive by yelling at him yesterday. So aita? \n\nI feel like yelling might have taken it a step too far, since it could've just been a poorly articulated joke on his end. I come from a family of pretty sensitive people, myself included, so I definitely could've been overstepping it. I'm genuinely questioning whether or not I hurt his feelings since he is usually a pretty easygoing man, especially as my father, but I also feel as if asking me to move out over this is a bit drastic?\n\nEdit - For an extra bit of context,  i graduated a month ago. Since the day I woke up after graduation, he has been talking to me about my plans for moving out places, I might want to live and saving up for a place. I didn't quite mind this, although I found it kind of frustrating since I just now found a job after struggling to keep one because of my severe depression. We agreed that I should be moved out by the end of next year, and if I push that deadline, I would start paying rent. I was completely fine with this arrangement because I am eighteen now, and it's his right to ask me for requirements on his home. However, cutting my time short by an entire year is going to not only screw me over financially if I do get kicked out, but it's also the fact that if I do start paying rent, I will never be able to afford moving out in the first place. I NEED that year to figure things out. I can't juggle freelance voice acting, a crappy service job, and my mental health.",

If you're somewhat functional, it's because the meds are doing their job.  \n\nIf I had to guess, he saw the dosage and perhaps started to realize that your depression is REAL.  And then got worried that it would be a legitimate excuse for you not to move out so quickly, or that he would be seen as a \"bad father\" for pushing you out given your condition.   So he was challenging the dosage and the diagnosis as a way to validate his personal opinion.\n\nYour father has an agenda, and that is to get you out of the house. It may not even have anything to do with you and certainly not anything to do with your dosage of Prozac.  *(Just as an example, I had a friend in college whose parents stayed together until he graduated high school.  Then his dad moved out and already had a girlfriend.)*\n\nI don't know what his plans are, but they don't include having you in the house.  Don't bother trying to make it work by paying rent.  There is not an amount that will make him happy--it's just another way to leverage you towards finding your own place. \n\n\n\nYes, he is legally correct that since you are 18 and graduated high school, he is no longer obligated to feed and shelter you for free.  He can't kick you out without notice, however.  Legally you could stay, without paying rent, until he serves you with a proper eviction notice and the time (30 or 60 days typically) is expired.",

      "scenario_description": "So, a bit of a backstory. From my mother's side, I have three uncles. Two of them are truly amazing people, and the other one is a deadbeat. Growing up, being the angel my mother was, she had to bail him out of situations constantly, and he always took advantage of her kindness, seeing as one of my uncles cut him off, and the other one, while not cutting him off, doesn't help him financially from all I know. After my mother passed away, my father made it clear to him that he didn't give two shits about him so as far as I know he hasn't contacted us in a long time, or at least not me. Now, my father passed away a couple of years ago, leaving me three houses. I have been renting two of them out, but the last one, being the house that I grew up in, I just didn't have the heart to rent to anyone, and since I live abroad, it has been just sitting there. \n\nRecently, the previously mentioned uncle out of the blue got in contact with me to see if I would be willing to rent the house to him, since one of her daughters had just gotten married, and was looking for a nice place to stay. I don't even know how he got my number or knew that what house I was renting or not. My best guess is that my other uncle was just being kind to him and told him about me in conversation. Anyway, I replied with a simple \"Fuck off\" and blocked him and promptly told my wife everything because I found the whole thing kinda bizarre and a bit humorous. She knows about the whole situation but has never met him. She knows that I despise him, but just like my mother, being the angel she is asked me if I had any bad blood with my cousin who needed the place, and quite frankly, I don't. She suggested that I think everything over with my cousin in mind, and if I still didn't want to, then that was that. \n\nI reconsidered, and though I don't have bad blood with my cousin, as I don't really know her, from what I heard from my other uncle, she is not as bad as my uncle is, though. Still, I don't want to be associated with him through anything, even my cousin. I told my wife that I wouldn't be comfortable with everything, and she understood. It has been in the back of my mind, however, I'm all made up about not renting to him, but I just wanted to get some opinions. AITA for this?",

      "scenario_description": "I'm (40m) a father of 3.  My SIL (27f) and her husband (27m) had their first kid 2 years ago.  She's my wife's sister and we tend to see each other at least once a month for family events.\n\nFor my wife and I, we manage our kids ourselves.  If we go somewhere, one of us is always keeping an eye on them, making sure they're not getting into trouble - especially making sure the youngest (a toddler) is safe - changing her if necessary, refilling her sippy cup, stuff like that.  Its our job.  If something happens, one of us pops up and takes care of it.\n\nSIL and her husband take a different approach and are frequently asking for help.  If we're all eating dinner and their kid has a poopy diaper, they'll sometimes get it, sometimes turn to one of us and ask \"would you mind?\"  The other day, I'm at a party and just came back inside after getting something for my kids, ready to sit down to eat and SIL asks \"\\[Baby\\] left her sippy cup upstairs - would you mind getting it?\"  Her and her husband both sitting down and perfectly capable.  It's not like they've asked a few times when they're overwhelmed or there's only one of them - there's been times one of them is lying on a couch reaching a book and ask me for something.\n\nIt's not like what they ask for anything I'd consider a huge inconvenience, so I feel petty saying something - but part of me just wants to say \"Look, my wife and I are responsible for our kids - you're responsible for yours.  I don't ask you to change our kids' diapers or grab their sippy cups from the next room, don't ask me.\"  WIBTA?\n\n",

I might grab the diaper bag for them, but I don't change diapers any more.  \n\nI grew up in a big family. Younger me would have said \"Are your legs broken?\" \"No.\" \"Then, no.\"",

      "scenario_description": "Last year, a friend of mine got engaged and I was very happy for her. She asked me to be her maid of honor, which came as a shock as I didn’t think we were that close, but hey! I was open to the idea so I said yes. Her wedding is next year in June. \n\nMy boyfriend of 6 years proposed to me in December, and we were eager to get married so we set the date for September of this year. Our timeline is obviously quite a bit shorter than hers, and out of self-inflicted obligation, I asked her to be a bridesmaid. \n\nIt has been a nightmare since then. Not only is she directly all attention to herself when talking about MY wedding, but there is this constant competition from her about our respective weddings. They are not related, do not have a theme overlap (mine is at the ren fair and hers is more garden party), and yet every time I bring something up, she has to turn it back to her wedding. She has also texted me nonstop every single day about the most random things that are very needy for me to answer, and it’s honestly overwhelming and I dread every time her name pops up on my phone. I have muted her completely on every app. \n\nAll of my other bridesmaids have expressed some issue with her to each other, and it finally trickled down to me after I hinted at being unhappy to my best friend / man of honor. Not only is she doing this to me, but she is actively seeking attention in their group chat for planning things, and expecting them to cater to her schedule, and tries to make it sound like SHE only knows what’s best for me, despite having known the others for 3-4x longer. \n\nUnfortunately at this point, I regret asking her to be my bridesmaid. I don’t want to hurt her feelings, and I am also an unfortunate people-pleaser… but this is my wedding, and I should be happy. I am currently stressed thinking about interacting with them all as a whole group if she is involved in any capacity. \n\nWIBTA if I removed her role as a bridesmaid (not replacing her), even though I am the maid of honor in her wedding?",

      "scenario_description": "I (17M) am staying with my older brother (22M) in Nashville while I tour some universities. While out, my brother, his girlfriend (23F) and I stopped by Kroger to quickly pick up some items he needed. On the way back to his apartment, we got off the highway and saw a homeless man standing on the corner. I asked my brother if we could give him something, bringing up the giant jar of peanut butter my brother had just bought. His girlfriend agreed with me thinking it was a good idea. My brother said “fine,” rolled down the window, and handed the jar to the man.\n\nAfter that, he got noticeably quiet. He barely responded to anything his girlfriend or I said, just giving an “uh huh” or “wow” here and there. We played a few games after getting back, and when his girlfriend left, he said he wanted to talk. He admitted he didn’t want to give the peanut butter away but felt pressured and like he couldn’t say no in front of his gf. I apologized and explained I was just trying to do something kind and pointed out that he didn’t have to say yes if he wasn’t okay with it. He said it felt like I was being performative to make a good first impression on his gf instead of trying to do something good. He also said I don't know what it's like to live alone and buy my own groceries. He brought up budgeting and living alone but I told him it's unfair to be so stingy when that man has nothing. He said it wasn't my peanut butter to give, and the decision should have come from him. I asked if his gf asked to give it away what he would've done, and I didn't get a response. \n\nI offered to drive back to Kroger and replace the peanut butter. He thanked me but decided to just get his shopping for the week done anyway and we drove to the store. He told me to grab two big jars of peanut butter “in case we see another homeless guy.” I laughed and went to put them in the cart, but he stopped me.\n\n“The homeless man didn’t have a cart. You’re gonna carry the jars so you know what it’s like.” He was being for real. As we continued shopping, he offered me snacks since he mostly has gluten free food. However, every time I accepted something, he made me carry it. Soon I was juggling two giant peanut butter jars and other snacks, and he started adding items just to make it harder, all while laughing. It was honestly humiliating, but he really has no good food at home, so I wasn't going to say no.\n\nWhen we got off the highway it was pouring rain and the homeless man from earlier wasn’t there. My brother looked over at me and said, “Now he’s lugging that giant peanut butter jar around in the rain.\"\n\nSo… AITA? I get that I gave away food that wasn’t mine. And maybe I shouldn't have chosen peanut butter to give away but another item instead, but I thought we were doing something good. IDK I feel like he was being selfish, but now I feel guilty, but also kind of confused. AITA?",

It's fine if you don't want to give cash because you don't want them to spend it on booze or drugs, so food or clothing is a good alternative.\n\nSecond, while handing out a meal is often appropriate, a jar of peanut butter is not very helpful, even if the guy isn't allergic to peanuts.

I 20F was on dating apps and started talking to this boy 23(?)M and after a bit of texting i invited him over, we had plans to smoke weed and watch a movie.\n\nwhen he came over he brought this nice tall bong that had previously been patched up with electric tape near the stem, i offered to make him coffee and made us both a cup.\n\n as planned we smoked and \\*netflix and chilled\\*, it was all going well until it was time for him to go home.\n\nhe had set his bong on the edge of my counter and as i was putting away the coffee making supplies i accidentally knocked over his bong and it fell to the ground, breaking the stem part clean off (not the part which had been previously patched up) and i felt EXTREMELY bad and profusely apologized, he made sure to reassure me that he wasnt mad and it wasnt a big deal.\n\nhe didnt bring it up and we actually hooked up twice more after that without mention of the broken bong ever except jokingly, he hadnt asked me to pay him back for anything until a few weeks later when i sensed he was catching feelings for me (talking about future plans, even bringing up spending christmas with my family??)\n\nhe was ultimately starting to weird me out a little and i told him i really was not intending on dating him and only wanted to be FWB at most but even then it was getting too weird for me, he got pretty upset and texted me verbatim \"you broke my heart and my bong, i cant expect you to repair my heart but you could pay me back for the latter\" \n\ni was a little confused because 1) i did NOT break his heart, we knew eachother for barely a month and 2) he had NEVER asked me to pay it back until i \"rejected\" him. i had no money at the time and really couldnt pay even if i wanted to so i told him i would when i could, expecting him to get over me and let it go but he kept intermittently texting me every few weeks asking for the money (despite him having a job, and multiple other bongs)\n\ni was really confused as to why he wanted the money since frankly i dont think he really needs it and when i bring it up to him he blames me for the accident and says it was my fault and i owe him money, i ultimately blocked him because he was getting pretty annoying.

      "scenario_description": "So, I'm looking to move into a new apartment, quite soon, for college. My girlfriend has known about this too, and has wanted to move in with me to someplace so that we could share rent and have a place together and she could leave her her grandma's house. (We are both 20s, female, etc you get it)\n\nThis has been the plan for a while... But, the only problem has been that I recently found out that the SSDI that she is on (due to autism) is through a representative payee, meaning she doesn't get the cash directly, and instead it goes through her grandma, who dictates and spends the cash for her, and just gives her an allowance or whatever.\n\nHer grandma doesn't want her to move in with me. We are long distance and have seen each other quite a few times, but her grandma is still very, very apprehensive about it (especially because it's a gay relationship...) and so her options are to either convince her doctor to write a note to help convince the social security administration that she is able to deal with money herself, or to switch her representative payee and have me be in charge of her finances legally. I honestly do not, in any way shape or form want to have to deal with the government in that way, and all the extra stuff that that entails. I am telling her that she has to start representing herself, but she really would rather just have me represent her.\n\nTo be fair on her part, it would be easier in theory to make me her representative, as it's just a form or two and an interview just seeing if I'm good enough essentially. But to make herself responsible for the money, it's getting a doctor to say she is capable and then needing to convince the social security administration that she is worthy, which is probably harder, and there is less chance of succeeding. She is very shy and might not assert herself well enough.\n\nBut either way I only figured this out like a couple weeks ago and I have to have a place to live near the school by September at the absolute latest... I've already been looking at places with roommates and signed up for loans and all that so I have money for housing, I just want to get this done and not have to worry about anything, it's honestly already a lot to be looking for my own place myself for the first time. And I so worried about just having the cash in hand every month and I can't even start looking with her unless I'm sure she can bring in rent too but she was so wanting this it's just ughhhh.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

She can pay herself rent if she owns the house, for example.\n\nI'm a representative payee for my son.  I pay his rent and other bills, and then he gets the rest as spending money.

      "scenario_description": "Our wedding budget allowed us to not have to worry about limiting the amount of guests (within reason).\n\nMy best friend at the time. and groomsman, Russell (not real name), had a girlfriend (Shannon) who no one liked. Everyone was around her only because Russell is a great guy, perfect gentleman, etc. He's the kind of guy that is so nice, and everyone wants him to be happy, and find a good woman, and have a good life. Shannon, on the other hand was very negative, toxic, and people thought she was a little weird (not in a good way). There are many stories of her just being rude, a party  pooper, and I later found out saying bad opinions about us. These comments would surface on Facebook, through some games we play in friend groups, and through talking behind our backs.\n\nBasically, Shannon was rude and a \"you must be fun at parties\" type of person. The part that was hard for me was that while Shannon was so negative and toxic, and judgemental (Christian-type judgemental), Russell was so good and happy. I felt like I was supposed to tell him that his gf sucks, but who am I to tell a happy man something negative.\n\nSo when it came time to send out invites, I felt like I was at a crossroads with inviting Shannon or not. Many friends and even family have expressed their concern with sitting at the same table as Shannon. Then my fiance (now wife) requested that Shannon not be invited, and that was it, I sent Russell one without a plus one. He didn't know, but he was the only person with a significant other who didn't get a plus one on his invite. Am I going to go into my wedding/marriage upsetting my best friend, or am I going into it upsetting my wife, and close friends?\n\nThe wedding day came, and I left a seat open for him, and understandably, he didn't show up. I wasn't mad about it, and I understood it, but I was a little bummed. Many guests came in, looked at the list of tables, and were relieved that Shannon wasn't at their table. Then they felt they can party freely. I don't regret not inviting her, but I feel like in hindsight, I could have approached the subject differently/sooner.\n\nAm I the asshole for not inviting his plus one?\n",

      "scenario_description": "Not long ago, a friend invited me and a bunch of other friends over for a get-together.  I'd never been to her house before, and it was in an area that I didn't know, so I asked one of the other invitees (Alison) if she'd mind giving me a ride.  She said \"Sure\", and on the night in question, she texted me to say she was on her way to my place.  I replied \"Great!  Let me know when you're outside, and I'll come meet you.\"\n\nA word of explanation - it was a very chilly night, and I didn't want to just hang around outside waiting for her when I could stay indoors where it was warm.  So, I thought telling Alison that was reasonable.  She disagreed.  When we arrived at our friend's house, I overheard Alison indignantly telling everyone \"And then Shalamarr told me to let her know when I was outside her house, like I'm a fucking Uber driver!  I'm not a fucking Uber driver!\".  She repeated this several times, and every time she said \"I'm not a fucking Uber driver!\", her voice got more shrill.  People looked uncomfortable, and no-one said anything (including me, which I now regret).\n\nWhen it was time to leave, Alison said loudly \"(Other Friend's Name), I think **you** should drive Shalamarr home.\"  The other friend was glad to do it, fortunately, otherwise I **would** have had to call an Uber (heh).\n\nSo - WITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi all,\n\nAbout a month ago I broke up with my ex girlfriend, after being together for 8 years. Because of the housing crisis in my country we still have to live together before we can sell the house. We sleep in separate rooms, but are civil to each other, and my ex is handling this very maturely.\n\nTwo weeks ago I met a girl at a festival.  We were flirty, but nothing really happened. We talked a lot, I wanted to kiss her, but she told me that I needed to sort my life out before she wanted to kiss or do anything. Fair point, but we did stay in contact via text.\n\nEver since we’ve been talking a lot, flirty stuff but also serious stuff (since she went to a break up of her own), and even made plans to get together after I got a new apartment etc.\n\nLast week, I took a walk after dinner and ended up talking on the phone with the festival girl for a couple hours. When I got back home my ex asked what I’ve been doing and I told her I called my best (male) friend.\n\nApparently someone overheard me talking on the phone and told my ex. \n\nNow my ex is furious, telling me I’d done something disrespectful, by both lying about who I talked to, and by trying to move on so quickly after 8 years and while still living together. I explained that festival girl and I are only talking, nothing happened and I met her after the break up. I know it’s soon, and maybe not the nicest thing to do, but is it really that disrespectful? In my mind I tried my best not to hurt my ex, but I’m not sure. \n\nWhat do you think? AITAH?\n\n",

Instead you should have said \"I was on a walk and making some phone calls.\" And if she pressed you should have said \"We aren't a couple any more, so that's not your business.\" \n\nYour ex is AH for trying to impose her idea of \"too soon\" on you.  And it's not as if you had the girl in your bedroom. She has more of a point if the \"eavesdropper\" was a friend who did not know about the breakup. Which would make it seem like you were cheating on her and she didn't know. \n\nThat said, it is often said that when it comes to breakups, \"Women grieve, men replace.\"  In fact men are much more likely to stay in a bad relationship UNTIL they meet someone else.  It is almost certain that \"festival girl\" isn't your soul mate, but that doesn't mean it's wrong to date.",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway\n\nTry to keep it short.  I'm planning to go to a football game this fall.  My alma Mater is the University of Michigan, it is where I met my wife.  I'm from Oklahoma and almost all of my friends went to OU for college.  For literally the first time in my lifetime, Michigan is playing at Oklahoma on Sept 6th.   I plan to go hang out with my high school friends while repping my alma mater in my home state. However, this conflicts with my wife's 40th birthday on Sept 4th.  \n\nShe is not a sports fan, and doesn't care to join me on this trip. She says and I quote, \"i'm not spending my 40th birthday in fucking Oklahoma\".  \n\nShe has actually expressed wanting a 40th birthday bash. I've offered to do it the weekend before, which she doesn't like that date, and we'll do something nice ourselves.  Those plans are TBD.  \n\nMy parents still live in Oklahoma (We are in Arizona), so I'd want to head to Oklahoma a few days early to visit with Friends and Family before the game.  Not only will my Oklahoma friends be going, I've got several college friends I went to Michigan with going. I've got plans started for a large Tailgate.\n\n  I'm honestly bummed she isn't going, its a real worlds colliding moment, but she is not happy that I won't be around for her birthday weekend.  Things have been icy and she has called me an asshole for prioritizing a football game.  AITA?",

I've been reading a lot since I was 11, and The Hunger Games got me into books. My (11f) younger sister came to me a few days ago, and asked if there's any books she could read. I gave her the first book in The Hunger Games, and she said she didn't want to read it, and if there's any different books. I let her look at my bookshelves, assuming she'd pick something like Percy Jackson, or another YA novel that is appropriate for her. (She's almost twelve, and she is mature for her age.) Instead of grabbing one, she grabbed Fourth Wing. I had just gotten it from one of my friends, and since I know the contents in there aren't appropriate for her, I said to wait until she's a bit older. She denied, and tried to take it. She called my mom into the room, and my mom didn't understand that she can't read every book I own, and I didn't want to explain that Fourth Wing contains some... you know. She called me a jerk, and I'm wondering if I am. So, AITAH?",

      "scenario_description": "My GF has an elderly aunt (80’s) who has multiple health issues and has been in and out of the hospital ever since we started dating (just over 2 years). The aunt hasn’t passed yet, but they took her off her medications besides the pain meds and it’s only a matter of time before she passes. The family has arranged the wake to be Thursday (6/26) with the funeral Saturday (6/28).\n\nI work out of state for 2 weeks every month in a professional where if you don’t work, you don’t get paid (no PTO, no sick days, no vacations days, etc). I was supposed to fly out today (6/23) and changed my flight to 6/26 late night. Luckily, I have a buddy who is able to cover me through Friday. Which means i’ll be able to attend the wake and fly out afterwards. The reason i’m flying out Thursday night even though I have coverage Friday during the day is because it’s a 6hr flight and I wouldn’t make it in time to start my shift Friday morning. Keep in mind, I do work weekends when I’m away so the “why not just fly out after the funeral on Saturday?” question doesn’t work in this scenario. \n\nI told my GF this was the best I could do and she got really upset and said “I can’t believe you’re going to make me be alone when they put her in the ground.” I know it’s an emotional time, I didn’t say anything back because I know no good can come from it. AITA for trying to properly manage my professional career with her personal life? I feel like it’s unreasonable for my GF to have expectations of me just continuing to take time off of work so I can be there when she will have plenty of support from her family and friends. Not to mention I pulled off a Hail Mary just so I could attend the wake. All while absolutely NONE of the anticipated wake/funeral days are guaranteed because her Aunt is still hanging on and those days could easily get pushed back further and further. \n\nUPDATE: Aunt is still alive. Wouldn’t surprise me if she fought staying alive for another week. Thank you all for the supportive comments and even those of you who considered me being the asshole but wanted to know more information\n\nUPDATE: She passed this morning. Wake/Funeral got moved to Sunday/Monday. Which means i’m still missing them and pretty much missed work for nothing. Life lessons learned.",

      "scenario_description": "This is such a stupid thing to even talk about but whatever.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend \"Dan\" (M27) and I (F25) both work full time. Dan and his friends (4 guys, all late 20s) all work from home, and they like to meet up and hang out when they work. Great! Happy for them! They'll rotate between their houses, meeting up for lunch and kind of extending that into a post-work hangout.\n\nThe thing is, all of his friends live alone. Dan & I live together. One of my biggest pet peeves is having random people in my house when I get home from work. I hate it so much-- I just wanna take my shoes off and relax and I can't do that if there's four dudes that I don't really know in my living room and kitchen.\n\nI spoke to Dan about potentially removing our house from the rotation, or at least taking his friends out around the time I get home. He said that was controlling, which maybe it is. He also said it wouldn't be fair for them to host every week and for him to just skate by.\n\nI get that! I do! But I feel like I'm a variable that isn't being accounted for here. Honestly I'm conflicted here, so I figured I'd ask: am I an asshole for not wanting my boyfriend's friends over when I get home?\n\nEDIT for more info, from a couple questions (& comments) I've seen:\n\n- The guys come over once a week usually. Sometimes twice a week. They come over at lunchtime (noon ish), and they're there until usually 7PM or so. I get home at 5:30 ish.\n\n- I do not want or expect my bf to stop hanging out with his friends, nor am I expecting him to break up with me for this. I didn't lecture or yell at him or anything, we had a regular conversation about this.\n\n- The guys themselves are not creepy or weird or anything. I'm just tired after work and I like being able to unwind, and part of that (for me at least) is the comfort of knowing I don't have guests around.\n\n- I can't avoid them that much-- our apartment is an open floor plan & the only bathroom is in our bedroom, so there's always *some* level of interaction.",

As far as him \"skating\" by not hosting, I'm sure he could make up for it by bringing lunch, snacks, drinks, etc.\n\nBut further, I have to say that this whole set up is weird.  These guys are supposed to be working.  My guess is that they do most of their work in the morning, then spend their afternoons goofing off while keeping an eye on their emails.",

      "scenario_description": "I (27NB) live with my Mom (58F) and Sister (24F). I used to pay my mom \"rent\" to contribute to household costs. However, this has long been a point of contention for two main reasons.\n\n1) Despite also being an adult, my Sister was never required to pay rent by my Mom. This double standard felt incredibly unfair to me;\n\n2) The rent I paid gave me no rights/control whatsoever over my room by her admission, resulting in the incident that led me to stop paying her.\n\nThe incident:\n\nMy grandma was visiting from out of town and my mom decided to move her into my room while I was out despite the fact that, like I said, I work from home most of the time while both Mom and Sister work out of the home. Also important to point out is that I'm autistic, and it's really important to me to be able to work from my room as it's my comfortable, safe space, arranged as I like. My productivity drops like a rock if I'm forced to work from any other place in the house.\n\nI pointed both these facts out to my Mom and concluded that since my Sister's room has a single bed and Granny is a restless sleeper who might fall out, the best solution would be for her to sleep in my Mom's bedroom. Since my Mom and I have nearly identical sleep schedules during the week, we could share my bedroom at night, and she'd be gone in the morning before I started working. \n\nBut she didn't want to. First, because that meant she had to pick her outfits the day before and move them to my bedroom (oh no, what a hassle /s) and then because her, Sister and I would all have to share a bathroom and leave the in-suite bathroom to my grandma (we were currently all sharing the in-suite bathroom because Sister didn't want to share a bathroom with grandma). Then she ran out of excuses and simply said she didn't want to.\n\nI got angry because she wasn't giving me any good reasons so I told her I was going to move granny's things to her bedroom whether she liked it or not because I had an important project and I needed to work. She shot back I had no right to do that because she owned this house, and I answered that I pay for my room so I have a right to it.\n\nMy Mom laughed and said that what I pay is contributions to the household and that she owns my room and can do whatever she pleases with it. I answered that if contributing to the household as her child gave me less rights then a tenant I was not paying anything anymore.\n\nI've stuck with it for two months now but she keeps trying to guilt trip me saying she needs the money for household expenses. But at the same time, she won't charge my Sister anything and I have word from family members that her finances are very well off, she's just paranoid about money.\n\nAITA?\n\nReason I might be the Asshole: She's my mother and owns the house, we have no formal contract, therefore no matter how much I pay I have no inherent right to my room. Plus whether she charges my Sister rent or not is technically none of my business.",

      "comment_text": "ESH.\n\nYour sister is a working adult, as are you.  Yes you should both be treated equally.  Either you both pay rent or you don't.  So your mom is AH for that, and your sister is an AH for taking advantage of your mom.\n\nIt matters how much you contribute.  At the minimum you should be paying for 1/3 of the groceries and the household bills.  That doesn't even get into paying \"rent\", which is to help with her mortgage, property taxes, etc.\n\nSo if you've been paying much more than 1/3 of the household expenses, the rest is rent and it should mean you get to keep control of your room.  If you had an apartment, your landlord could have you vacate only to make emergency repairs, and then you'd get a per-day credit on the rent.  No landlord can have you move out just so their relative can use your place for the weekend.\n\nThat said, your \"verbal contract\" with your mom does not depend on what she agrees with anyone else.  You need to negotiate the conditions as well as the price, and if you can't come to an agreement then you need to find somewhere else to live.\n\nNOTE:  I will also say you are conflating two different things.  You don't work at night.  I understand your grandma's \"things\" would be in your room during the day, but there's no reason you couldn't still work in your room during the day and let your grandma sleep there at night.  So the \"productivity drops like a rock\" comment is a little over-stated.",

      "scenario_description": "My husband and I are currently on a little beach getaway and are staying at a new place. Upon arrival we found someone parked in our designated spot. They happened to come out as we were standing there trying to contact the property manager and happily moved. We went out for a bit and when we came back a new car was once again in our spot. \n\nWe called and got ahold of the property manager and asked if they could do anything and they said that we could park in a spot with no designated room (which doesn’t exist) or park in a business parking lot they own around the corner. There are no extra spots in this lot and it is very small. The parking lot itself is kinda sketchy and dark and not visible from the property, but that’s where we had to go. Because I’m a halfway decent person I didn’t park in someone else’s designated spot I feel like that is just common sense and decency. \n\nTruthfully at least two of the rooms do not have assigned spaces, but if I were in those rooms I would have called and figured out a solution instead of stealing someone’s spot. I should also mention that I am in my first trimester and this is causing me so much stress because I’m worried about my car when I should just be relaxing. I’m also just gassy and crampy and uncomfortable and don’t feel like walking farther. We’re supposed to put tags on our cars when we park and they never put theirs on (which coincidentally would indicate which room they were staying in) I haven’t left a note yet I’m waiting to see if they leave tomorrow at any point and I can get my spot back but I feel like if I paid for a parking spot I shouldn’t have to fight for one. \n\nAITA if this continues and I call a towing company and have them removed? This doesn’t bother my husband as much, but I think it’s because he can have a few drinks and take the edge off and it’s also not his car. I honestly can’t tell if I’m reasonably upset and this would be a correct course of action or if I’m just crazy hormonal right now. ",

I only started speak with her at the start of this year after 8 months of no contact because she ended up in hospital with sepsis due to falling while drunk and she basically said my sister and I were cunts for calling an ambulance for her. It’s a long story and complicated. To preface my dad passed from cancer when I was 7 so I don’t have another parent \n\nI am 5 months pregnant and I have gestational diabetes. Last month I was going through a tough time and my husband could not get the time ott work to come with me to my 1st diabetic clinic appointment in the maternity hospital which is 2 hours from where we live and we only have one car, he offered to call in sick and take me but I said no as he can’t afford to miss work. My mother was supposed to go with me as emotional support but she decided the night before she didn’t wanna go on the train and was trying to insist my husband bring us up and then go into work which would’ve meant a 5am start for us. We got into a huge fight where she called me\nA bully for saying she was selfish and we didn’t speak for 2 weeks.\n\nAnyway we’ve been speaking since prob 2 weeks ago again and I had a gender scan Friday and found out he’s a boy, very happy and chose a name my husband and I love. It’s a fairly classic name and it was my dad’s name also and we both just love it. I told my sister and she liked it and without letting me know she told my mother and she called me and said I know you might be sentimental\nAbout that name but wouldn’t you pick something fancier and I said no it’s our decision and tried to put a boundary up \n\nToday she texted me and said have you thought about any more names and I said no not really and she said I like Adam or Callum and I just said not for me and I decided to tell her I don’t want to talk about the name anymore and just want positivity as it’s our decision and if she could keep it secret please and this is what she wrote back \n\n“You don't have to be so aragant l was only makeing conforsation”. I can’t do this anymore with her, she just makes me feel like an asshole all the time and I can’t handle it anymore\n\nAm I an asshole?

      "scenario_description": "Hello Reddit,\n\nOkay, so I sold my car to someone I already had a contentious relationship with. It is a 2008 Lexus 400h with low miles, for $2000. Even taking into account the dings and wear and tear, Kelley Blue Book says it's worth about $6,000, private party sale. I was trying to be a nice, good person and put the bs behind us.\n\nI know he's going through rough times (always) so I agree to take $300 a month. For his birthday I even took off a payment. Traded something for a months payment. Cash wise, I've received $300. All together, I'm still owed $1100 for the car alone.\n\nI released liability, but he didn't register it and it's past due. I also got a ticket in the mail for the expired tags and have to contest that...but then last week, it gets towed due to no parking permit. Since he didn't register it, I have to go down and bail her out of car jail for $395. \n\nAt this point, I've had it...and refuse to give it back unless it's AT THE MINIMUM, fully registered...at least I WAS...but according to him, this makes me an asshole because \"I'd do it if it were anyone else\" and \"How can I get the money to give you if I can't drive?\" He throws in things like \"You treat me like a second class citizen and are not a friend\" as well. Blah blah blah. I asked them why I have to keep taking losses because he can't get their shit together and that makes me a horrible person in their eyes and started the hate/victim texts.\n\nI'm not sure if it's just some sort of narcissistic FOG I'm being put under or if I'm actually being the asshole and hindering any supposed goodness he could be doing if he had a car. I have a tendency to have shit boundaries, but I'm working on it when I do set them, I get a lot of push back from people who don't like boundaries. I'm 99% sure I'm not the asshole here, but would love to send this threads link to him if I'm not the AH.  I hope this makes sense...I'm tired lol\n\nSo am I an asshole if I don't give the car back so that he can make money?\n\nTLDR; Sold my car, haven't gotten all the payments, and it got towed.

I told her that she probably shouldn’t be tanning at all on that drug and that I’ve seen people get blistering sunburns on accutane despite SPF and that it’s not worth the sun damage or risk of blistering sunburn and scarring. I am genuinely concerned for her and she’s naturally pale. (For background I was a medical assistant at a dermatology office for over a year and worked with many different physicians, PAs, NPs during my time there. I’m currently starting medical school in July.) to which she replied saying that “her dermatologist told her she can go tanning on accutane if she wears sunscreen” and so I replied with this “😬” and she replies “girl your not a doctor. Soon though 😍” so I replied I mean none of the doctors I worked for ever recommended tanning on accutane and also you obviously still got burned despite the sunscreen. AITA? ",

I have told Lary that I don't feel comfortable with them doing it right next to me but his excuse was you don't have a say in what we are doing since you are sleeping. I usually wake up and I must stay quiet  until they are finished because they treat me like I don't exist and this got us to an argument resulting in me stop going to Ann's for sleepovers ,since it makes me extremely uncomfortable. Now to tha main problem in 2 days we have agreed that we will go to a club and then thay will crush at my place for a few hours and I don't have a problem with that. My problem is that they want to get freaky in my house. The think is Lary has been making snide remarks all week about me leaving MY room and leaving them alone and I can sleep on the couch that's how they think of it. But I feel discasted only with the thought of something like that happening anywhere in my house especially from other people but I know they wonk care and try to guilt trip me especially Ann who always puts him in the mood its not like he refuses but you get it.I feel extremely disrespected because they can accept that I don't want this to happen in my house. WIBTA if they try to initiate and I kick em both out in the middle of the night? \nAm I overreacting when it's make me uncomfortable hearing Them right next me doing it ?\nIs he right  for saying since I am sleeping I don't have a say?\nI NEED some outside perspective and some advise on how to handle things \nWIBTA?",

      "scenario_description": "For context, we're both in the high school equivalent of juniors (17M) in the US and go to the same school. \n\nMy friend James wants to apply to a prestigious university in the UK, and has had his sights set on it since before sixth form even started.\n\nI  have similar academic interests to James and have been considering applying for engineering major in said uni (the same major that he is planning to apply to), since I have good predicted grades that would make me competitive among the applicant pool seeing as I did well on recent mocks. I was initially not confident enough that I could get the required grade to apply, hence why I only started considering it recently. \n\nWhen I told James that I'm thinking of applying, he freaked out and told me not to because I have a marginally better predicted than him with one more A\\*, and that the uni doesn’t accept multiple students from the same school applying for the same major, which I’m not sure is true, because if we apply to different colleges within the universities, I believe our applications will not be read by the same people. He then proceeded to tell me that the UK isn’t my only choice for college because I’m applying to top universities in other countries like Switzerland and the Netherlands, and that even if I got an offer from said university I might not even accept it, wasting the offer. He then pointed out that he has had a strong wish to go to the university for a long time, meaning that I would be sabotaging his plans by applying since it would substantially reduce his chances of getting an offer. He also said that he would not want to be friends with me if I applied because I would be doing so with the knowledge that I am entering direct competition with him for his dream university.\n\nI told him I would reconsider it, but I do want to shoot my shots since I think it would give me a good education as one of the top universities here (by now you probably have a good idea of what uni it is). His extremely consequentialist method of thinking also didn't sit well for me; I have an interest in the school for what it can academically offer, but in his eyes I’m applying only to rob him of the spot that he feels that he deserves—which he undoubtedly does, seeing all the hard work he put in to get accepted there. I apologised and said I wouldn't apply but I still have a nagging feeling that I let myself be pushed away from a good opportunity with a line of reasoning that I'm not even sure is factually sound.\n\nI don’t know what I should do because I do have a genuine interest in the school's major, but at the same time want to have a good relationship with my friend. Was it disingenuous for me to consider applying and would it be if I did? \n\nTL;DR would it be something morally incorrect to do as a friend if I apply to the same university as my friend (who has been working hard towards this for a long time), which is competitive and supposedly caps the number of accepted applicants from one school if they apply for the same major?\n\n",

And no, he does not get \"dibs\" on the school just because he said it first.\n\nIt obviously WOULD be an AH move to apply just as a way to deny him his shot.  But you have a right to the best education and best future you can get for yourself. \n\nYou can certainly do a little research or actually CALL the school and ASK them about their admission policy. I really don't think they limit admissions to one per school.   That sounds like him trying to scare you off.  Also, if you are admitted and then decline in a reasonable time, they will go to the next candidate on the waiting list, which could be him.\n\nAsk yourself this:  If you're accepted and he's not, how will you feel?  What if you are BOTH accepted and both go?  Will you be best friends and roommates, or will he hate you just for having risked his future?",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (26f) got married last month and I (29f) thought everything went ok. She had a beautiful venue, but I thought her wedding was a bit trashy.\n\nHer dress was beautiful if cheap. It was a midi dress with off the shoulder sleeves. I advised her to cover her arms because she’s got a “patchwork” tattoo sleeve on her left arm and I asked her if she really wanted a mouse in a party hat or a cowboy cat in her wedding photos. To which she said, “I think it’ll look sick as hell.”\n\nShe looked beautiful on her wedding day aside from her tattoos and the bit of rodent pee she got on her dress from when she insisted on taking pictures with her “babies”.\n\nThen for the reception she ordered pizza and had a Walmart sheet cake. Why? So she could spend money on a bounce house and ballpit.\n\nI thought the worst part of her wedding was that she didn’t allow kids to come to save money and because in her words “kids can be attention whores”. So I had to pay $100 for a sitter in addition to the $200 I gave them as a wedding gift.\n\nAt the end of the night, she and a bunch of party guests ended up jumping into the pool at her hotel because she “thought it would be fun” and bribed the night manager at the hotel to open the pool again so they could swim for a bit which I thought was rude. So her wedding dress and her husband’s suit was ruined from that.\n\nYesterday, we were going through the photos and she said that she had the time of her life and everything went perfect. I mentioned that I thought it was a bit immature and she said I was just a stick in the mud and if I could let loose for 5 minutes, I could’ve had fun too. I tried to show her where I was coming from but her husband stepped in and said if I didn’t have anything nice to say, I shouldn’t say anything at all and that even his 5th grade students knew that. I didn’t say anything else about it but what she said still kinda hurts.\n\nAITA for saying that I though my sisters wedding was immature and trashy?",
