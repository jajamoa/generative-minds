      "post_title": "AITA for telling my dad I felt excluded after his girlfriend didn’t include me in dinner?",
      "scenario_description": "(26F) have been staying at my dad’s place for a bit while I look for a new apartment. He lives with his girlfriend (36F) and her daughter (13F). It’s been okay lately  howecer honestly kind of awkward. I try to stay out of the way, keep to myself,  I always clean up after myself, etc. I’ve never been super close with his girlfriend, but I always been polite.\nThe other night, my dad mentioned they were going out to dinner and said I should go with them. He said it might be nice for us all to spend a little time together and get out of the house. I agreed, thinking it’d be chill and maybe a good chance to ease some of the weirdness.\nHe wasn’t coming, he had some work stuff, but I figured as the one suggesting it, I was genuinely welcome. We got there and my father's girlfriend told the host, \"table for two\" and then turned to me and said something like, \"Oh, I thought you were just tagging along. This is a little celebration just for her\"\nI was kind of stunned. I didn’t want to make a scene so I just said “oh okay” and walked off. I ended up getting takeout nearby and Ubering home.\nWhen I got back my dad asked how dinner was and I just said, “Apparently I wasn’t invited after all.” Now his girlfriend is saying I overreacted and made her look bad, and my dad’s stuck in the middle. Her daughter also gave me a weird look when they got back, like I had ruined the night or something.\nI don’t think I’m entitled to a free meal or anything, but I was told I was invited. It just felt really crappy to be treated like an afterthought. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I forgot to mention that next to the restaurant we went, there is a place that I usually meet with my friends and my father's gf knowns about it because she took me a couple of times. So maybe she thought I am headed that way? ",

Then F13 let her mom know that she did NOT want you there.  Unless F13 made that known while in the car, GF is AH if she brought you to a restaurant and then turned you away at the host station.\n\nBut Dad is primary AH here.  As a parent and step-parent myself, I know the parents in this situation hope the kids will magically form this \"new family\" but it almost never happens.  Kids want to keep THEIR parent, and not share.  That's especially true of any 13yo--she had no interest in sharing her alone time with her mom with you.  She probably wanted to spend the dinner trashing you.\n\nThey were getting out of the house together, and your dad stupidly threw you into the mix.  If you all wanted to spend time together, you could do it at home, rather than \"staying out of the way.\"  He forced you into their plans, and it predictably backfired on him.",

      "scenario_description": "My mom (57) told me two weeks ago about a dinner for my grandmother's (91) bday, and that I was supposed to go as many others would be attending there. Plus, its a \"free day\" (im from another country so i dont know how you call when nobody has to work because the Holy Virgin) and i wouldnt have classes. I (27F) knew about my grandma's bday and had planned on calling her to wish her a happy bday but I knew I would probably not be able to go because, despite being a free day for religious purposes, that didnt stop my teachers from giving us homework with time limits, I had to make and deliver a group report (one of many) to one of my teachers on that day (and the group I was in kept slacking on their parts). I told this to mom and she was angry, saying that \"when she gets old I would probably abandon her\" or that \"I'll forget about her\" just like I'm doing now with grandma. I explained to her that it's not just about the report; it's also the fact that we live 2hrs, 50min away from where grandma lives and we barely have money for public transportation on daily basis (some days I walk to my college which takes me 1hrs 30min on foot) and that it would be better if I skipped and called later to wish her a happy bday. I thought we made peace but today in the morning (she has to leave 2 days before) I rushed up to say my goodbyes but she threw me a \"I hope your precious report gets a good grade\" and left. \nAITA here?

Eight hours (6 hours of travel plus at least 2 hours for the dinner) is a lot of time to carve out of your schedule.\n\nYour mom is understandably disappointed, and her \"precious report\" remark is meant to convey her disappointment in you.  She feels that you do not value her and your grandmother as much as your studies. Which is not true in general, but is true on this day.\n\nAnd further, your mother may be judged by her mother for not \"raising you with the correct attitude\" or some such traditional nonsense.  But nonsense or not, your mother will be judged for HER failure to bring YOU.  \n\nSome people put a lot of value on large group gatherings.  Personally I don't agree.  If you have 20 people for 2 hours, each person spends minimal time with the guest of honor.  So it's just a display of \"look how many relatives I have who care enough to come see me at one time.\"  For me, I'd rather visit one on one for 2 hours.",

I hope you get it, but I can’t come if she’s there.” I even said I’d love to take her out separately for her birthday.\r\n\r\nJess did not take it well. She pretty much said, “It’s my birthday, and I want everyone there! You’re making this about you. Can’t you just be civil for one night? That drama was forever ago.” She called me “dramatic” and said I was “holding grudges,” like I’m the problem for not wanting to hang with someone who trashed me. Now she’s on this mission to get me to “just get over it.”\r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for prioritizing my own comfort and mental health by not wanting to go to a party where my ex-friend, who totally screwed me over, will be?",

      "scenario_description": "My friend 42F and I 38F go into the city a few times a year to catch a show. We’ll call my friend Laura. Because we’re old and can’t stay up late driving home, we usually stay at a hotel overnight and drive home in the morning. \n\n\nLaura’s mother has a crazy amount of travel points so she uses them on the hotel for us so we don’t have to pay. \n\n\nLaura always asks me to pay for both tickets to the show, and she (and her mom) will cover the hotel. Laura is obviously not paying anything for the hotel, but since it’s her mom’s points she says that’s a fair trade. \n\nI agreed the first couple of times but after a while it just seemed like Laura is being a little selfish. Her mom travels for a living so she has what seems like an unlimited amount of points. So it’s not like she’s depriving herself by using the points on our hotel. \n\n\nFor an upcoming show, I told Laura that it’s not fair that she gets a free show every single time and that I’m always paying full price. I asked her to split the cost of the tickets. I’m trying to save money and I honestly can’t afford continuing to pay for both tickets. She got mad and said using her mom’s points is the same as her paying her own way. \n\nI eventually said I would just drive home after the show because I can’t afford to keep paying both tickets. She ended up pulling out completely and now we’re not even going to the show at all. \n\n\nAITA? \n\n\nEdit:\n\nWe stay at the same hotel each time which, if paid cash would cost around $450 including fees. We would stay in the same room together. This particular show is $300 per ticket but that’s on the high end of tickets from past shows we’ve seen together. I can’t afford $600 for one night. \n\n\nThe reason this is so frustrating is Laura’s mom’s points are for a specific hotel chain. I don’t get to choose where to stay. \n\n\nI would never stay at this particular hotel if we were deciding based on cost. I would choose a much cheaper place. There is no reason to stay in a hotel with lots of accommodations if we’re only staying there to sleep.",

If you're driving, then you could also go a little outside the city for the hotel.\n\nLaura is getting a free room from mom and free tickets from you.

      "scenario_description": "My ex gf (33F) and I (31F) first met in a whirlwind romance in May of 2023. A few months into dating she fell on hard times and I offered to let her stay with me for a few months while she got on her feet. I am an extremely independent person and love living on my own and having my own space is very important to me but I really cared for her and wanted to help at the time especially with the expectation that it would only be a few months. However, a few months has now turned into 2 and a half years and we technically broke up almost a year ago. Throughout her time here she’s had several jobs however, the positions were seasonal and/or didn’t align with her morally so she quit. When she first arrived I was of course not charging her rent as I was genuinely trying to help her get on her feet. However, after living with me rent free for almost a year I realized she probably wouldn’t have the means to move out on her own anytime soon so we began to go half on rent and expenses. However, it only lasted maybe 5 months until we officially called it quits and she couldn’t afford to pay her half and save up to move out because she’s only been able to hold down a part time position for some time now. So she is still struggling. I feel bad she is in this position still but my lease for this apartment is up in October and I planned to end it and start my solo journey as I am ready to move on with my life and start anew. However, I am conflicted with what I know I deserve and desire (which is separate lives) and doing “what’s right.” My ex has expressed that her financial instability makes her feel scared for her future, she fears she will end up homeless if I stop carrying the load for her as she doesn’t have any friends and she’s not close with her family. She feels like because we are not toxic, have healthy communication and get along for the most part that she doesn’t see why I can’t just continue to help her out until she is stable enough to do so on her own. She often gets emotional and upset about the reality of having to figure out her living situation in the next few months and reminds me that if it were her in my shoes she would continue to help her ex for as long as they needed. I can fully understand her fear but it’s been almost 2 and a half years of me supporting her and I really need to know if AITA for no longer wanting to house my now ex partner of almost a year? ",

      "scenario_description": "Hey im an old guy who has never posted on reddit, but at the urging of my neice and nephew I'm going to attempt to post this here :)\n\nSo I (50M) have a neice and a nephew who are both 18 and just graduated. A few years ago when they were entering HS I made a deal with them, if they kept a B average their entire time in high school I would buy them any car of their choosing, within reason of course. We added a clause that they got 1 semester forgiven, so they were able to mess up one semester and I wouldn't hold it against them, I felt like 7/8 semesters with a b average was pretty fair. \n\nSo my neice maintained her grades, she did mess up her sophomore year but otherwise was right on track. My nephew on the other hand pretty much never did right, we were lucky that he even passed every semester. I offered help, tutors, books, tried to make sure he was okay mentally, whatever he needed but turns out he just straight up was not doing his work. He was doing good on tests but would never do his actual work resulting in his grades being low. \n\nSo last week was when my neice got her car, she choose a 2025 Toyota camry. My nephew kept asking when he was going to get his, and I told him he didn't stick to his end of the agreement so he did not get a car. He still got a very nice gift back at graduation. Now, him and his mom are angry with me and saying im favoring my neice and now he is refusing to speak to me or his sister. I don't think I messed up but I'm starting to worry, AITA?\n",

      "scenario_description": "Hi everyone,\nI’d really appreciate some advice or perspective on this.\n\nI live with a close friend, and when we first moved in together, we made a mutual agreement: neither of us would move out to live with a partner unless the other could afford to move out too. The idea was to protect each other financially — we both rely on splitting the rent and bills, and neither of us could afford to live here alone.\n\nNow the situation is getting a bit more complicated. I’ve been with my boyfriend for a while, and although nothing is happening right now, he’s started talking more about the idea of us living together in the future. He has mentioned that he would like to move in together in just over a year. It’s not immediate, but it’s clearly on his mind, and I think it will become more of a priority down the line.\n\nHe’s mentioned that he would really struggle emotionally if he felt ready for us to take that next step but I couldn’t, just because of this arrangement with my friend. I completely understand where he’s coming from — I don’t want to feel like our relationship is being held back indefinitely. But at the same time, I don’t want to break my word or leave my friend in a situation she can’t manage financially.\n\nShe also has a tendency to react quite strongly to stressful or uncertain situations, and I’m really worried that even bringing this up will cause a lot of distress and conflict. I know she’d be scared, maybe even angry, and I don’t want her to feel abandoned or betrayed.\n\nI feel torn — I don’t want to trap myself, but I also don’t want to leave her in a bad spot. Has anyone navigated something like this before? How do I approach this conversation in a way that’s honest but considerate?\n\nThank you in advance 💛\n",

      "scenario_description": "I (18F) live at home and split time between my divorced parents — about 3 weeks with each. Lately, my mom and I have been getting into frequent small arguments, and I’m starting to feel overwhelmed.\n\nWe’ve always clashed a bit. My mom can be really controlling: she wants to know every detail when I go out, constantly reminds me about things I already do (like flossing), and is really strict about money. When I had a children's bank account, she would literally check it daily and question me about any spending. She has a decent income, owns a nice apartment, and her parents (my grandparents) are wealthy, so I don’t fully understand why she’s so stressed about money all the time.\n\nOne recurring fight is over how long I shower. I wash my hair twice a week, which takes me around 25–30 minutes total. I even turn the water off while conditioner or a hair mask is sitting — a habit I actually learned from her! Still, she knocks on the door to complain, saying I take too long. Today it happened again, and we got into another fight. She thinks 2-minute showers (sometimes even without soap!) are fine, and worries about the water bill.\n\nI’ve told her that I’m not being wasteful and that I literally can’t shower faster given my routine. When I bring up how she’s being too controlling, she gets defensive and says she’s just being a normal parent. I’ve also told her that I’d rather live more with my dad since he’s much more relaxed and not so critical — but I can tell that hurts her feelings. She gets sad when I say stuff like that, and I don’t want to upset her, but I also feel like I have a right to speak up since I spend so much time living with her.\n\nSo... AITA for calling her controlling and saying I’d rather live with my dad?",

Some banks don't properly disconnect family accounts even when requested by an adult child.   So, her being controlling about your account won't be a problem any more. \n\nShe IS being too controlling as a parent.  This may be because she's realizing that you are grown up and won't be around much longer.  She will be losing her role as \"mother\" and she doesn't like that.  Unfortunately this is manifesting at \"holding on too tight\" which will cause her to lose you. \n\nI suppose one way you could turn this around is to say  \"Mom, I need to wash my hair today.  Is it OK if I take a 24 minute shower here, if I turn off the water while I'm conditioning?  Or should I go over to Dad's?\"",

      "scenario_description": "My younger sister is temporarily living with us and she was having a hard time studying because my 3 y.o. son would constantly interrupt and ask her to play with him whenever she was studying in the living room/kitchen. She asked if she could use my husband’s office so he wouldn’t bother her and I agreed since my husband wasn’t in the country (he lives abroad about 70% of the time) at the time anyway.\n\nI don’t think I did anything wrong but my husband came home as a surprise before the office had been cleaned up and he was angry at me for letting her use it without asking him first. Like I said he wasn’t in the country and he wasn’t supposed to visit any time soon so I thought it would be fine since it’s not like he needed it at the time. He doesn’t see it the same way and thinks I should’ve asked first since it’s his office.\n\nWe’ve had a few arguments over this with neither of us budging. Admittedly in our last fight I did get angry and tell him he shouldn’t even have a home office since he’s barely home which did unfortunately escalate the fight. Part of the reason I said that is because my husband was never happy about my sister living here even though it’s had a very minimal impact on him and I feel like he’s using this office situation as an opening to send her back home.\n\nI've already bought a desk for her room so she can study in there but AITA?",

It's just polite. However if the kid has their own apartment and I've converted their room to a \"guest\" bedroom, they would not need such notice.  \n\nYou can argue that it is a shared space in the house (\"the\" office rather than \"his\" office) but you should have had that discussion before you let her use it.  You can also argue he \"doesn't need a home office because he's barely home\" but if he works from home when he is home, then he very much does need a place to keep his business files and such organized.\n\nI agree that she did no harm by using it, assuming she didn't move any of his things, and he potentially overreacted.\n\nBut it sounds like you didn't tell him (before or after) because you knew or suspected that he would not approve.  That's sneaky.  And if you were being sneaky because he is overbearing, then still ESH.",

Why do you need help with something?”\n\nAt 9:00pm he texts me and finally asks me “I was gonna ask if you can take me to the airport 🤣”\n\nAfter the last text I sent him I stopped looking at my messages and I went to sleep at 10:30pm.\n\nI wake up and see that he sent me a text at 12:30am saying “Just so you know, you hoe for that 😒…. That’s $40 out my pocket”\n\nAm I really the asshole for not taking him to the airport? Sure I could’ve been more attentive to my phone last night but at the same time he could’ve been more direct with me and asked me in the first or second message instead of dragging it along all day. He also could’ve asked me a day or two prior.\n\nEdit: Looks like I’ve gotten about 0% YTA, 95% NTA, and 5% ESH.\n\nEdit: The day after he said that he was trolling(I don’t believe) and that he asked me too late.

      "scenario_description": "I (30f) have my family (senior mother and adult sisters) visiting this week and we plan on going to a museum in an hour. I have my daughter (5 mo) in a stroller. We decided to go to the museum via public transportation where the destination station doesn't have an elevator to get to the street level. \n\nMy husband (33 m) won't be joining us on this trip and I expressed that it may be hard to get out of the station with no elevator. My husband suggests that we should carry the entire stroller up/down the stairs or escalator as is (not folded) with the help of my sisters where one would hold the handle and another holding the front/wheels area.\n\nI think this is incredibly dangerous to do with a baby and say I'd rather take off the baby seat, fold the carriage and have one of my family members carry the folded stroller while I have the baby seat with baby. This turned into a huge argument with him saying it's a skill issue if we can't do it his way. I told him his idea is delusional, saying we've watched multiple videos of people before fail at doing this with other objects. I then said there's no reasoning with him and that I was done with him.\n\nSo AITA\n\nUpdate: Thank you everyone for your comments. Just a quick mention that both my husband and I crafted the post and we both read what you all said separately. After reading, my husband apologized for being argumentative. He felt like he needed to defend his idea after I dismissed it the first time. I apologized for calling his idea delusional. Apparently a lot of you do it even though I've never seen it myself. But to be fair, I also don't take public transportation regularly. I still will go through with my idea because I don't know what I'd do if I messed up and had to watch my infant just tumble down the stairs or escalator so I guess it is, in fact, a skill issue.",

You won't get any escalator manufacturer or building owner to sign off on it.  Heck, everyone at the airport takes their rolling luggage on the escalators and THAT's not supposedly allowed.\n\nThat said, you are missing your husband's intent.  Because you mentioned that something \"might be hard\"  and he wasn't going to be there, he took that as you asking him to fix it.  He felt OBLIGED to \"'solve the problem.\"  So then when you came up with your own (safer but more tedious) solution, he was offended because --*\"why did you ask for his help when you already had it figured out?\"*\n\nYes, I know you weren't asking for his help.  I have understood this difference between men and women for at least 30 of my 62 years, and yet I STILL fall into this trap.  It's just how guys like me are wired.\n\nEDIT:  On first pass I skimmed over your insults to your husband. Delusional?  That's harsh, considering that **PEOPLE DO THIS EXACT THING ALL THE TIME.**",

And recently she's told me I can't use her cutlery since recently spoons and forks have been going missing and she thinks it's my fault.\n\nSo I've been using my soup spoon and two sets of chopsticks, and she's been telling me that spoons and forks are still going missing so she bought weird plastic spoons, forks and knives. And still she blames me, and I've been getting sick and tired of it so i went to a car bootsale and bought a cutlery set for £3 and brought them home and cleaned them.\n\nRecently I saw her using my cutlery, she used four of my spoons, two of my forks and two of my knives. How didn't I know sooner? I went out for two days (I was at my sisters helping with her pets since she went on holiday) and when I got home I saw them in the basin. So I went to her and said, \"ma, I'm sorry but you can't use my cutlery. I paid for it. And you said i can't use yours so..\" And she got mad, yelled at me saying it wasn't fair and that I'm ungrateful, she used other words I cannot and will not say.\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nSorry if it doesn't make sense, I find it hard to spell and make sense in writing due to bad dyslexia.

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

You would pay $613 and they would pay $987.  \n\nIMO,  you should not care who is paying their $987, but you should not be expected to loan them $187 a month.

      "scenario_description": "I (28f) am filing this week to sue my now ex-friend, Veronica (24f)\n\nAbout 7 months ago Veronica asked to move in with me and my boyfriend, who owns a 5 bed/3 bath house. We’ve known each other for a few years and had grown close—she even introduced herself to others as my “bff”. My bf has rented out rooms before and since we had a vacancy we agreed to let her move in.\n\nThere was no written lease, but we agreed via text that she’d pay $800/month (utilities included) for a bedroom and private bath. Since she didn’t have a job when she moved in my bf allowed her to delay the first payment. But over 6 months, she cycled through 7 jobs, quitting each one for vague reasons like “bad vibes.” She made only one partial payment the entire time.\n\nDespite claiming she had no money, she was frequently going out, getting 90-minute massages, and taking long trips to meet up with men.\n\nWe had a 3-week Europe trip planned for years and Veronica offered to care for my pets while we were away—despite me originally going to hire a pet-sitter. I'm a zookeeper and take pet care seriously. I left clear instructions, supplies, and $100 cash for reptile food, asking her to keep receipts. She sent regular updates while we were gone making it seem like everything was fine.\n\nBut when we got back at 3 a.m., I was devastated. ALL my reptiles had no water, most of my fish were dead, the tank was filthy and overfed, and many supplies were missing/depleted.\n\nI messaged her—upset but not rude—asking what happened. She responded defensively, saying I should be “grateful” and claiming she did a better job than “anyone I would have paid”. When I told her I spent 5+ hours cleaning and over $300 replacing things, she brushed it off, offering only to go to the store to \"replace the fish.\" She also only used about $40 of the $100 I gave her and never paid me back OR replaced my fish.\n\nAfter that, she avoided me completely—only coming home late at night and staying in her room. Then one day I came home from work to find she had moved out without saying anything to me or my bf. She blocked me on all social media.\n\nWe were shocked, but let it go, UNTIL I got a call from a friend (who had only met her once) saying Veronica had messaged him AND my manager long rants calling me “evil” and saying she “saw the light” and needed to cut me off. I’m 4 months pregnant, and she even told my friend I should “get an abortion.”\n\nAt that point, my boyfriend and I decided to sue her for the $4,800 in unpaid rent plus damages to the room/bathroom. Most of our friends agree it’s fair but some think we’re in the wrong since we were going to drop it until she started bad-mouthing me and because she’s struggling financially.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "comment_text": "NTA.\n\nClearly Veronica is a \"taker.\"  The reason she has a history of renting rooms is probably that proper landlords check things like lease history.  It's much easier to take advantage of \"friends\" and then preemptively trash them when bugging out.\n\nShe knew her days were numbered, so she avoided you until she could find a new place before bolting.  \n\nAs for the pet sitting, I'm sorry for your loss.  In retrospect it would have been good to have her care for your pets for a week before you left her in charge of them. \n\nMy guess is she will try to avoid being served, and then will not show up to court.  You might get a default judgment,  but don't hold your breath expecting her to pay.",
