      "scenario_description": "My husband and I have both worked really hard over the years, and when we found out we were expecting, we agreed we’d both take time off to focus on raising our daughter in her first year. It sounded like a dream plan and something we were both genuinely excited about.\n\nFast forward to now—our little one is 6 months old, and things have not gone how I expected. While my husband does cook and I handle all the cleaning (a dynamic that’s worked for us in the past), when it comes to the baby, everything falls on me.\n\nI do all the feeds, naps, diaper changes, nighttime wake-ups (which happen 3–4 times a night), soothing, carrying—everything. She’s heavy and my shoulder is constantly in pain. I’m exhausted physically and mentally. Meanwhile, my husband spends most of his time on the couch watching TV, scrolling through reels, or going to the gym. If I ask for help or even just express how tired I am, he says I’m being “negative” and throws gender roles into the mix, implying that this is just what mothers do.\n\nApparently, I’m the problem because of my “negative aura.”\n\nI didn’t sign up to do this alone, and I’m starting to feel like a single parent despite him being right there. But every time I bring it up, he acts like I’m attacking him or ruining the vibe.\n\nSo—AITA for being frustrated and constantly bringing up how little he helps with our baby?",

      "scenario_description": "I'm in the process of buying a house with my fianceé, but I'm traumatized as to how unwholesome her fuzz riddled home is (1 bedroom apt and 2 cats). \n\n**The thing is, I'm allergic. I'm severely allergic to cats.** I have to take an allegra every time I go to her place, otherwise my face gets swollen, my eyes gets watery, and I get an unbearable amount of sneezing. Whenever I sleep there, the cats will walk on my face during the night and I'll wake up to a miserable next day. \n\n**She knew that, we were together for years, and still she adopted a cat.** Back then she put me against the wall, talking about how much she always wanted one, how lonely she was during the week, and ended up nudging me to accept it. After a while, on a whim, she got the 2nd one without even talking to me first. I didn't love the idea, we fought, but in the end I wasn't about to end a healthy relationship because of a cat, so I tried to bear with it. Now we're talking about marriage and we're on the process of buying a home, but I don't wanna live the rest of my life on daily allergy medication, with terrible breathing and overall welfare. \n\nAt first I proposed the cats to be strictly outdoors. We could put safety nets around the property perimeter and let them live outdoors with my dog. She DID NOT agree. I folded, and further proposed the cats to be restricted only to the ground floor, not being allowed upstairs to the bedrooms. This is where we're at now, and again, she does not agree.\n\n***The cats must have access to the whole house, and if they like, they'll sleep with us.*** \n\nAccordingly to her, \"her cats are her companions\", \"they always slept with her\", \"I AGREED WITH HER GETTING CATS BACK THEN\" (?) (she guilt-tripped me into agreeing with one, back then). \n\nNow I'm feeling pretty f\\_cking miserable over considering breaking up a marriage over a f\\_cking cat. I'd love not having this medical condition, but it's beyond my control. I'm not about to rationally choose to live a miserable life in a furpocalypse, sleeping in a shedquarters, never again owning a proper black pair of pants because she gaslit me into accepting them. \n\nAITA here?",

      "scenario_description": "My husband and I live comfortably. Bills are always paid and we save money with each paycheck. He has always been a very basic guy. His hobbies are cheap/free, he doesn’t go out much, and he almost never wants anything new. He usually buys the cheapest of whatever he does need. \n\nI don’t consider myself to be materialistic, but I do buy better quality than the cheapest stuff. I won’t buy the cheapest sneakers, but also won’t buy anywhere near the most expensive. My philosophy is I want something that will last a while and be comfortable and I use whatever it is until the end of its life. \n\nRecently my husband has started getting on my case for buying anything beyond basic necessities. He would make comments about how I don’t need the shampoo and conditioner I buy because the cheapest version is the same (it isn’t) or how I don’t need shaving cream (I do if he wants me to shave). It recently blew up badly with my skincare products. I use one cream and one moisturizer. That’s it. It helps keep my cystic acne under control. \n\nI recently bought a new tube of my skin cream and when it arrived, my husband got mad at me for wasting money and said I don’t actually need it. He says that I am burning money buy buying it and women don’t actually need skincare products. I told him he has seen me when I didn’t have it for months, my face was covered in painful acne. He says I am being dramatic and it can’t be that bad. He believes if he doesn’t need it or something works for him, it should work for me as well. \n\nHe brought it up when we were at his parent’s house and his family is on his side. His dad said I should stop buying things my husband doesn’t think I need in order to keep the peace. But I don’t think I should have to deal with acne, dry and brittle hair or whatever in order to keep him happy. He should be able to trust that I know what my body needs. \n\nAITA for buying things that aren’t complete necessities?",

If we give her a cup of water, she will have just a few sips rather than finish the entire cup more often than not.

Usually, the cup is filled 90% water and 10% organic orange juice. She will drink that entire cup 3-4 times per day. The past two days my daughter has complained her tummy hurts. My wife blames me for adding juice to her water. My wife has always taken issue with that drink and shes very adamant about how we should give her only water and no juice at all because of the sugar.

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "TW: Body image, bodyfat percentage\n\nI am a semi pro athlete in a weight class sport, and after YEARS of working with my coach we discovered the best method for me to make weight is to do a calorie cut to get me to around 13-15% bodyfat which for me PERSONALLY is below my healthiest percentage, but high enough that I can still perform and I water cut the rest of the weight. Please note, I only stay at the low bodyfat percentage in the weeks before my competition then I jump straight into a high calorie diet to gain a healthy level of fat back.\n\nMy sport has nothing to do with looks and is strictly a performance sport, but I particularly love how small my boobs get, because at a healthier percentage they become quite large to the point I have considered a reduction. My boyfriend knows this.\n\nI am now at my lowest weight I will be until my next comp, and he started making comments about how hes \"so excited\" for my weight to come back up so my boobs get bigger. I told him he's welcomed to think that, but please don't say it as its oddly frustrating for him to wish (outloud) for something I dread most about gaining weight\n\nAfter I asked him to stop talking about my chest, he stopped directly commenting on it but would drop comments like \"Just imagine how great you'll look next month\" while staring directly at my chest. So that turned to me asking him just not to comment on my body until after I've performed.\n\nHe got quite frustrated with me and said its unreasonable for me to expect him to say nothing about my body. I don't totally disagree, but I also feel that if he can't do it without inuendos about my chest that he should probably just stop? I'm not asking him to stop commenting on my body forever, but to just sort of wait.",

      "scenario_description": "I (24M) have an identical twin. We're not close, but I thought we had basic mutual respect. That belief was tested.\n\nI grew up in a traditional Southern town & only began coming out in college, about five years ago. It's been slow, especially with family. But since moving to DC in '23 for school/work, I've felt more comfortable living authentically.\n\nAfter moving, I met my boyfriend (26M), & we've been together 2yrs. Over time, I've introduced him to friends and family when I felt safe.\n\nCut to Nov. '24: I was home for the holidays & told my twin & his fianceé about my bf. They seemed happy for me. While staying with them, wedding details arose, & they asked if I'd be bringing a date. I said yes, my bf. My twin had gone to bed, but his fianceé said, \"While there are pros and cons, it's up to you if you want to bring him.\" That felt like a green light. My twin constantly deferred to her on decisions, so I didn't think I needed to double-check.\n\n5 months passed, my bf & I had spent $1,300 on travel (flights, hotel, etc.). 3 weeks before the wedding, I mentioned on a call with my brother that we were all set. His tone shifted: \"Oh, is BF actually coming?\"\n\nI reminded him of the convo with his fianceé. He said she never gave me permission & accused me of making it up. Then said, \"We can't allow your bf to come. We worry how Dad's side will react.\"\n\nI offered to call Dad on the spot. He dodged, saying he'd check with his fianceé (despite just saying it was his decision.) An hour later, no change. I was still invited-ALONE, still expected to buy a groomsman-match suiting (even though I wasn't in the party), & show up smiling.\n\nThat's when I snapped. I asked, \"If I didn't invite your fianceé to my wedding, would you still come?\" He couldn't answer & ended the call after some harsh words. \n\nTrying to make things right, I came out to my dad (which I feared for years) to explain the situation. He was surprisingly indifferent & even said uninviting my bf was extreme. He offered to talk to extended family. I thought I was removing the main obstacle. \n\nWeeks later, my twin called again. He now claimed our friends would be \"weirded out\" (So the excuse shifted) I said, \"If my bf's not invited, I'm not coming.\" He didn't budge.\n\nHere's the kicker: days later, my dad told me the fianceé admitted she did give me permission but changed her mind when she remembered \"who would be there.\" She denied this to my twin. Also, one of her bridesmaids is openly gay and brought her gf, but, according to the fianceé, \"she's not part of the family,\" so it's different.\n\nSo I didn't go. I'm still wondering if I made the wrong call. My absence was noticed. I got texts asking where I was. My mom had to explain it repeatedly. So instead of avoiding attention, my absence became the story. My relationship with my twin is dead, & some family ties now feel fragile.\n\nPart of me wonders, should I have sucked it up & gone solo, just to preserve bonds that shaped my early life?\n\nSo, AITA for skipping the wedding?",

      "scenario_description": "I’ve (22f) posted here about my roommate (24f) before. She has always had issues contributing to the household, including buying things like toilet paper, dish soap, laundry detergent, etc. She also rarely does her dishes promptly or takes out the trash or other household chores, and struggles to pay utilities on time. Sometimes I even have to hound her for the rent. I felt bad at first because clearly she wasn’t equipped to live alone but I quickly got frustrated and became short with her. We were friends at first but not so much anymore after I’ve had to put up with her for this long. \n\nOur year long lease ended and we have been living month to month since then. Eventually she got a boyfriend. He lives with his parents but that hasn’t stopped her from spending most of her time at their house. I started seeing her less and less. \n\nA couple days into May I hadn’t seen her for maybe two weeks. I texted and called her to see when she was going to pay her share of rent (due on the 5th) but she basically ghosted me. I got in contact with her mom and eventually my roommate reached out to say she’s staying with her boyfriend’s family “for now” and doesn’t think she should be expected to pay rent for somewhere she’s not staying. I kindly asked if that meant she would be moving out but she didn’t respond. \n\nI paid rent myself, which was a huge unexpected expense. After that I decided I was done. I texted her over the course of May and June asking her to move her stuff out but she didn’t respond to me. Her mom kept promising me that her daughter would take care of it but she never once got back to me.\n\nAfter July started I recruited a couple friends to help me pack up the stuff in her room and donated most of it to Goodwill and the Salvation Army. I also asked the landlord to change the locks which he did. \n\nThe other evening she finally shows up and is mad that the locks have been changed. I told her she’s not living here and doesn’t pay rent so she has no reason to enter the apartment. She got even more upset and said that she was never moving out, she was just staying with him for the time being. She told me the situation didn’t work out so she planned to come back and live here again. I told her that she was already off the lease and it’s my rental now. She started crying and said she had nowhere else to go and I felt really bad. She asked if she could at least get some of her stuff, she needed some clean clothes and a shower. I told her that because she never told me she was coming back or made plans to move her stuff out, I donated everything that was in her room unless it looked precious or expensive and stored the rest in her closet. \n\nShe completely freaked out and threatened to call the police on me. She was inconsolable. She cried about how I even donated her dead grandmother’s wedding dress, which had been in a special box somewhere in her room. I apologized profusely because I did feel really bad but it all could have been avoided if she had tried to communicate with me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I told her by July I would start getting rid of things if she didn’t make plans to do it herself. Where I live, a unit is considered abandoned once they vacate and owe rent. The cost of the items being donated will determine how long I need to store them before getting rid of them. I asked her to make arrangements for her things beginning in early May, which she ignored. I emphasized in June that I would be donating her things by July, which she also ignored. Additionally, her mother was aware the whole time and promised me her daughter would take care of it by June 30th, which she didn’t. ",

      "scenario_description": "I 42M, have two kids living with me, my daughter Anya (17F) and my stepson Noah (14M). Noah’s mom passed a few years ago, and I’ve had full custody since. He’s had a rough go of it, but he’s a good kid, with his quirks. He’s not antisocial or shy, but he does not appreciate having his space invaded and when very upset, he can kinda 'shut down'. \n\nAnya is much more outgoing and has a lot of friends- she asked to have a sleepover this weekend with four of them. I said yes, of course, but given that the friends who were coming were pretty loud and have a tendency to crowd Noah, I told her to make sure they don't go into her brother's room. Also to keep things down after 11, so that the house can sleep. \n\nIn my opinion, these are not strict rules.\n\nTo my surprise, I came upstairs to check on them at about 10- they are 17, I didn't think I needed to check on them every hour or something- and they were in Noah’s room. And they looked like they'd been there a while, two were literally sitting on his bed, with him there, one of them was flipping through his sketchbook, another was messing with his other stuff, and they were all kind of giggling in this weird way.\n\nNoah was clearly upset, he didn't say anything/move, but there were tears in his eyes and he didn't respond when I tried to talk to him. I told the girls to get out right then, and that I was calling every single one of their parents. Anya was pretty upset with me, but I told her that I gave them TWO rules and they failed spectacularly. \n\nI did actually call all of their parents, and sent them home as soon as possible. Anya blew up, saying I embarrassed her. I told her to go to her room, and that we would speak on this in the morning. I spent about 20 minutes with Noah, before he decided he wanted to cool down on his own, and I went back to my daughter- who chose not to speak to me. \n\nIts late, both of my kids are (hopefully) asleep, and I'm left not knowing if i handled things right. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I'm the only one who cooks in our house. It's just 4 of us, my husband, me and my daughter and little brother. My husband is 27 and I'm 25.\n\nMy husband barely knows how to make eggs, even though I've tried to talk to him constantly about learning how to cook. My daughter and brother are still in elementary school so they only help me cook.\n\nThe responsibility falls on me and it's honestly exhausting.. so, I just set up a system in my head. It's easy, for breakfast It's just something with eggs or cereal. Lunch is some sort of sandwich, burger, or leftovers. Dinner is the meal I usually plan but I have like 10 dishes I repeat. Sometimes I'll go off, especially Sunday, but generally I stay because it's easier for me mentally.\n\nWell, one day I made just pasta alfredo with chicken and as we were eating, my husband mentions that it would be nice if I made \"fancier\" dishes. I asked him what he meant and he explained he wants me to change things up, add some more meat dishes and variety.\n\nNext time, we went out shopping and i was putting ingredients I don't usually buy into the cart. As the ingredients started piling up, my husband was getting all puffy and upset. We got to the meat aisle and I started picking out beef and that's when my husband lost it and started taking things out of the cart. Saying that we can't afford my \"fancy living\". I blinked at him and tried to explain that he was the one who asked for variety and different dishes, so I'm buying different ingredients. \n\nHe rolled his eyes and told me that I'm being dramatic. I just let him do his thing, taking out most of the ingredients out. \n\nThe next week, I made the same dishes because that's all I had ingredients for. A week passed and my husband was all pouting that I made fried rice again and that he's sick of chicken. When I pointed out that he took out all the beef out of our cart, he blew up on me again and said I'm being an asshole because he doesn't know how to cook? \n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (27F) am 4 months pregnant and just moved in with my boyfriend Peter (27M). This baby was unexpected, but we’re excited. Things have been better lately, though we had a big fight while moving in because I didn’t unpack fast enough to keep the floor clean. He hates having stuff on the floor. We talked it out and will help each other around the house.\n\nOne thing we agreed on was doing laundry together, sorting lights/darks/colors. I’ve been handling some cleaning, cooking dinner, and doing dishes. The other day, Peter started a load of laundry. I got home from work, finished it, and put the clean clothes on the couch. I was exhausted, so I asked if he could start folding while I finished cleaning, and I’d join him after. He said no because he doesn’t want to fold my clothes.\n\nI didn’t get it and kept pressing him, which led to a fight. Turns out he just “has a thing” about folding other people’s clothes. like he has a thing about clothes on the floor. I’ve been trying to stay on top of laundry for him, but I personally don’t mind clothes on the floor (clean or dirty). Eventually, I was too tired to argue and just went to sleep.\n\nWhen I got home the next day, I expected the laundry to still be on the couch. Instead, he had folded his clothes and put them away, and put my clothes into bins in our room. I thought that was mean, but he didn’t really get why I was upset.\n\nWe talked again, but we’re at an impasse: he won’t fold my clothes and insists I fold my own. But I told him if I have to fold everything myself, I won’t be keeping up with his standard of cleanlines, if he won’t compromise or help.\n\nSo now I’ve told him I’m not doing team laundry. I’ll keep my clean/dirty clothes in piles on the floor like I used to. He says that’s unacceptable and wants to be able to run laundry when he wants, but I’m done. I know it’s immature to leave a mess on purpose, but I’m frustrated. We are supposed to be a team.\n\nI even asked if this was a cultural thing (we from different countries), but he said no. It’s just his personal “quirk.” He says it’s okay because he’ll fold the baby’s clothes, but I’m doing the cooking, cleaning, and shopping, and I’m exhausted. And I can’t help but wonder, if I’m too pregnant to even bend over soon, are my clothes just going to end up in bins my the room every time?\n\nTLDR: Moved in with my BF while pregnant. He refuses to fold my clothes and puts mine in bins. I’m tired of being the only one doing housework and now I’m opting out of laundry completely. AITA?\n",

      "scenario_description": "So, I (30M) have been dating my girlfriend (27F) for 2.5 years. We’ve talked about marriage for a while, and a few months ago, we even went to a jeweler together to design her dream ring. She was really excited, and I knew how much the surprise element of the proposal meant to her—she’s mentioned how important the surprise was since we started ring shopping and that it has been a childhood dream for her. \n\nA few days ago, her car needed maintenance, so I offered to take it to the dealership for her. They told me it would take about 1.5–2 hours, and I realized this was the perfect opportunity to go pick up the ring, which had just been finished.\n\nI didn’t want to ruin the surprise, so I tried to be sneaky. I turned off my location services (or at least I thought I did), called an Uber, and headed to the jeweler. It took about 45 minutes total. I picked up the ring—and for what it’s worth, I went WAY over budget to make sure it was exactly what she wanted—and then turned my phone service back on.\n\nThat’s when I saw several missed messages from her.\n\nTurns out, I didn’t fully disable my location and she had checked it when I wasn’t answering her texts. She saw I was at the jewelry store and put two and two together. She confronted me immediately. I tried to cover it by saying I was still shopping around and negotiating prices at different jewelers.\n\nShe didn’t buy it.\n\nI eventually came clean and told her the truth—that I had gone to pick up the ring. She flipped. She got really upset and said I “ruined” the entire proposal ( I have yet to propose). She said it felt like I didn’t care about her dream and that I was selfish for not trying harder to keep it a surprise. At one point, she even demanded I buy her a new ring\n\nNow, I already felt awful. I knew how important the surprise was to her, and my stomach dropped when I saw those texts saying she knew where I was. But I never expected her to react with that much anger. She’s said some things that really hurt—like that I ruined the moment on purpose, and that I don’t listen or care about her feelings. I listened, apologize profusely, and tried hard to convince her to look at the bigger picture of our future. She didn’t appear to care about that or my feelings on the matter as this would have been a special moment for me as well. \n\nI just wanted to surprise her with the ring she designed herself, and now I feel like I can’t win. She keeps asking “how are you going to fix this?” \n\nI need help, what do I do. AITA for accidentally ruining the proposal surprise?",

      "scenario_description": "Im 28 years old and I have been with my Bf for about  a year, i have several food allergies gluten, dairy, and shellfish. My boyfriend's family invited me over for a big homemade dinner. I told his mom ahead of time that I have allergies, they already know this but I remember them because I've had a couple of incidents with them because of this. and she said, \"Don't worry, we’ll have something for you!\"\n\nWhen I got there, everything had at least one ingredient I couldn’t eat. I didn’t want to make a fuss or go hungry, so I discreetly pulled out a Tupperware meal I made at home and started eating it.\n\nMy boyfriend’s mom looked offended and said I was being disrespectful and that I didn’t trust her cooking. Later my boyfriend told me I embarrassed him and should’ve just “eaten around” the allergens to keep the peace.",

She specifically didn’t care about hurting you! \n\nI wouldn’t even keep this man for another minute he is a massive jerk.\n\nNTA",
