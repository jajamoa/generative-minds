      "scenario_description": "My (27M) wife’s (27F) father passed away when she was 9 and her mom remarried to her stepdad when she was 15. My wife and her stepdad have always butted heads because he oversteps and has tried to force himself as a father figure in her life. When my wife’s mom married him they both made it very clear that he was never going to be her dad and he basically had no control over her and he has reluctantly accepted that over the years. \n\nFast forward to today, my wife gave birth to our son a week ago, he is the first grand baby on both sides so all the grandparents are trying to figure out what they want to be called. My wife’s stepdad’s name is David and wants  our son to all him ‘Avi’ which means father in Hebrew. My wife and I are uncomfortable with our son calling him this so we asked him if there was another name he could go by and he made a fuss that he intentionally didn’t want to be called grandpa because my wife has made a point in the past that his actual grandpa is no longer with us. But now he’s complaining that we aren’t going to be happy with any name he wants to go by. \n\nAITA for telling him my son isn’t calling him father?",

      "scenario_description": "I (34M) work in a small office with about 10 people. We share a communal kitchen, including one fridge. Over the past month, my lunch has been stolen *five times*. Not just random snacks entire homemade meals I bring from home, gone without a trace. It’s not just frustrating, it’s expensive and messes up my day.\n\nI mentioned it a couple of times in the group chat, like “Hey, someone’s been taking my lunches. Please stop.” Everyone either ignored it or sent vague messages like “ugh that sucks” or “some people are the worst,” but no one took responsibility.\n\nSo I bought a mini fridge and put it under my desk. Nothing fancy, just enough to hold my meal and a drink. I also put a little lock on it just for extra peace of mind. Since then, no more stolen lunches.\n\nWell, last Friday, one of my coworkers (I'll call her Dana, 29F) confronted me during lunch and said it was “weird and selfish” that I had a personal fridge. She said it made me “look paranoid” and “not part of the team.” I said I was tired of my food being stolen, and this was the only solution that worked. She said I should’ve just brought stuff I wouldn’t care about losing, like snacks or microwave meals, if I was so worried.\n\nA couple of others have now made little comments like, “Don't let him see your lunch he might lock it up,” or “We get it, you're special.” I’m starting to feel like the weirdo in the office just for protecting my stuff.\n\nAITA for locking up my lunch instead of letting this keep happening?",

      "scenario_description": "My friend 42F and I 38F go into the city a few times a year to catch a show. We’ll call my friend Laura. Because we’re old and can’t stay up late driving home, we usually stay at a hotel overnight and drive home in the morning. \n\n\nLaura’s mother has a crazy amount of travel points so she uses them on the hotel for us so we don’t have to pay. \n\n\nLaura always asks me to pay for both tickets to the show, and she (and her mom) will cover the hotel. Laura is obviously not paying anything for the hotel, but since it’s her mom’s points she says that’s a fair trade. \n\nI agreed the first couple of times but after a while it just seemed like Laura is being a little selfish. Her mom travels for a living so she has what seems like an unlimited amount of points. So it’s not like she’s depriving herself by using the points on our hotel. \n\n\nFor an upcoming show, I told Laura that it’s not fair that she gets a free show every single time and that I’m always paying full price. I asked her to split the cost of the tickets. I’m trying to save money and I honestly can’t afford continuing to pay for both tickets. She got mad and said using her mom’s points is the same as her paying her own way. \n\nI eventually said I would just drive home after the show because I can’t afford to keep paying both tickets. She ended up pulling out completely and now we’re not even going to the show at all. \n\n\nAITA? \n\n\nEdit:\n\nWe stay at the same hotel each time which, if paid cash would cost around $450 including fees. We would stay in the same room together. This particular show is $300 per ticket but that’s on the high end of tickets from past shows we’ve seen together. I can’t afford $600 for one night. \n\n\nThe reason this is so frustrating is Laura’s mom’s points are for a specific hotel chain. I don’t get to choose where to stay. \n\n\nI would never stay at this particular hotel if we were deciding based on cost. I would choose a much cheaper place. There is no reason to stay in a hotel with lots of accommodations if we’re only staying there to sleep.",

      "scenario_description": "So starting this of I (21F) have Pcos and was getting a laprascopy to check for endometriosis as it runs in my family. Luckily I didn't have it but still have the stitches and everything healing. So I got the surgery last Monday and first and second day was at my In Laws house as I have a bad habit of getting up and cleaning when I can't or shouldn't. The problem is while I was there I was given no help almost at all and expected to get up every hour to walk laps around the main area of the house twice. Not including getting up to go to the bathroom or getting myself food. I also wasn't allowed to stay in the guest bedroom past 9am I had to be on the couch. So while I was there my MIL was caring for my niece in the other room who is a year and a half but just left me to my own devices on caring for myself. Which I got jumped on by both the cat and their little dog who is about ten pounds. So by day two I just said I wanted to go home. Over the next few days I was getting better but day five I leaned down to pick up some of my husband's clothes cause I almost tripped over them. Causing me to later find my stitches having dried blood around them which is in my belly button so it wasn't hard to tell. They still have been bleeding but I'm not catching when but it really hurts to move too much and so I spent today laying down. Most days I get up amd pace cause it's my routine. The problem was today I was supposed to go to church but I didn't cause I wasn't able to sleep and the stitches kept hurting extremely bad. Later in the day after my husband got home my MIL texted this:\n\nMIL: Hey how are you doing?\n\nME:Still hurting but mostly just extremely tired. One of my stitches had dried blood so I didn't wanna accidentally open them or anything\n\nMIL:At this point, it shouldn't matter. Your insides should be practically healed. I've had similar procedures in the past and was up and doing everything that I needed to be doing within a day or two. It shouldn't be taking you this long to heal. Is it red, extremely hot around it or does it have puss coming out of it? \n\nME:No pus just and not hot just slightly bleeding for some reason\n\nMIL:It does not help to just lay around. You have to get up and get moving. I know you can do this. You are stronger than you know. When you feel weak, ask God to give you the strength and energy that you need in order to be the person that He created you to be. \n\nEND \n\nSo after my husband said that she was just worried that I'm not healing and that she is right and I need to get up and move but now I'm upset about it and have to go to work tomorrow as my first day back. I work at a gym but am not allowed by my doctor to pick up anything heavier than a jug of milk. I won't get my stitches out till a week from Tuesday so I need to be careful not to rip them. \n\nSo am I the asshole for getting upset and just not going cause I was hurting or is she right?\n\nUPDATE: So I returned to work today and had to go home after 3 hours as it felt like something was really hurting, and when I took the bandage off, there was more fresh dried blood. I called my surgeon's doctor's office, and they are scheduling a soon as possible complications follow up. As for my husband, he is 27, and before we married , he lived away from his parents to go to college. He and I have been married two years in August. To him, cleaning is a hassle he doesn't usually do since all of his off days he is usually doing yard work for his grandparents or parents. He works 9 hour shifts at a car dealership selling parts, but his drive got longer due to us moving, so it's an hour there and an hour back. I usually try to keep up with cleaning but have severe depression issues and drops that last for months at a time, so it gets dirty often. As for the reason for the surgery and why they did it is because I was having extreme abdominal pain on an almost daily basis and which was making me miserable and having difficulty finding a job and then working. My mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and great great aunt all had endo, and my mom had ovarian and endo cancer that spread up to her diaphragm. I also had been put on birth control that I didn't want as I really want kids and in my family die to complications you usually can't after 25 or it is incredibly difficult to the point of my cousin almost died giving birth to her son three months ago and she is 30. The reason for the birth control, as you can guess MIL. As my SIL just had my neice and they said not to have a baby till she was at least three. Which mostly translates to I need to be healthy beforehand, which I get. When I got married, I was 110 at 5'5 and had undiagnosed pcos, which I was having bi monthly cyst ruptures. They convinced me to take the birth control to help with the cyst. Which led to me getting ocular migraines and worst ruptures. I stopped the birth control almost four months ago and still no period even when they gave me the progesterone pills to try making me have one before surgery, which I just spotted for a day. I am now 127 pounds and am trying to get to at least 140 and hold it for at least four months, then start trying. My husband, yes, is a mama's boy but has gotten me out of my own shitty family, and we are trying to work on boundaries with his parents, but he is a little thick headed.\nDOCTOR UPDATE: saw a doctor who said I was fine as no fever or pus. Didn't check the internal stitches and my blood pressure was 100/50. At the moment I'm extremely tired and my mother is working hard to get a doctor who will check the internal stitches. I have stopped telling my MIL anything and my husband is worried but trying to get MIL involved ",

      "scenario_description": "I’d like to get some outside opinions on a situation that’s gotten a bit tense.\n\nI (35M) have been doing very well for myself lately after a recent promotion. One of my personal goals is to purchase a specific Rolex, and as part of that process, I’ve been trying to build a relationship with a luxury watch dealer.\n\nMy sister (40F) turned 40 last month, and since she’s my only sister and we’re very close, I wanted to give her something special. She loves designer items and has always appreciated that kind of thing. So for this milestone birthday, I got her a Cartier watch—around $13,000. This is very out of the norm; typically, I spend about $200 on birthday gifts for both her and my brother-in-law (44M).\n\nThe issue started after her birthday. My BIL made a comment about how he hoped for a designer watch for his birthday too, and I laughed because I assumed he was joking. Turns out, he wasn’t. I later found out he was actually upset about the difference in gifts. For his birthday (which was two months before hers), I got him a $200 gift, and for his 40th a few years ago, I gave him a $500 steakhouse gift card.\n\nNow both he and my sister are upset. She said the gift was “disrespectful” to their relationship and too unequal, and while she seemed sad saying it, I couldn’t tell if it was more about the tension it caused.\n\nTo be clear, I wanted to do something unique and meaningful for *my sister*—someone I’ve known and loved my whole life. I’m not particularly close to my BIL, and honestly, I’ve always had to tolerate a bit of insecure behavior from him.\n\nI didn’t expect this level of drama from what I saw as a generous, one-off gift. They have asked I return the watch and get two \\~$6k watches. Privately my sister has said I shouldn't of bought the watch as its annoyed my BIL very much. \n\n**TL;DR:** Got promoted, doing well, bought my sister a $13K Cartier watch for her 40th as a one-time special gift. BIL is upset because his gifts have been in the $200–$500 range. Now both he and my sister think I was disrespectful. AITA?",

My sister gave birth to her baby in Feb 2025. When I announced my pregnancy to her back in a December 2024, I also announced the gender and the name. I found out then she had chosen the same name for her baby boy. She has had 3 other children for which she never announced the name. Since then, she has been pressuring me to change the name because it causes her panick attack and anxiety. She says two cousins born 5 months apart with the same name is going to create an unnecessary rivalry. \nMy husband and I had chosen this name prior to conception and announced it to everyone (family & friends) without knowing her intentions. I am now 8 months pregnant and I have been calling my baby by this name since the beginning. I don't want to change the name. Neither my husband. For context, her baby was born with some kidney issues and had to have surgery at 10 weeks old so she has been especially sensitive. Personnaly, I feel for her but I don't see this name thing as a major issue and I don't want to change the name of my baby because she has anxiety over this. Am I the assole? ",

I had my baby in the car (3 months ), after the crash baby was absolutely hysterical, of course she would be, my friend then tried to scramble in the mix of it to take her out of her carseat. I do admit I may have said it harshly to not remove baby from their carseat until first responders got to us. The car was not on fire and we weren't in any mortal danger. \n\nOn a normal day anytime my baby gets to the point of hysteria I soothe them, hug them, rock them, etc. That was a once in blue moon occurrence I didn't. I kept trying to shush and soothe baby from the seat but obviously she was scared and wanted her mama to hold her. \n\nAt the hospital both my friend and I got the all clear and we were waiting on baby to be cleared, my friend went off on me telling me I'm a bad mom for not removing baby from the carseat. I simply explained to her, it was better for baby to stay in the seat incase there was spinal damage, the seat keeps the spine aligned and removing the baby from the carseat would cause further injury if there was already one. \n\nShe kept berating me, I was frustrated already and I told her when she has her own and god forbid they get into a crash she can yank her kid out of the carseat and do as she pleases. She got quite and said I'm an asshole for bringing it up because she has trouble conceiving, she has PCOS,  and may not be able to carry a pregnancy to term.  \n\nIdt I'm the asshole for bringing up a hypothetical situation or I don't know if my frustration got the best of me and I was insensitive but AITA for making that statement?\n",

      "scenario_description": "(English is not my first language, so sorry for any mistakes or typos) \n\n---UPDATE---\n\nI took my sister out for tea today, we talked, I acknowledged that I was wrong in how I acted and spoke, I apologized to her for all of the stress I started and caused. She accepted my apology. I then was explaining that, even though the pettiness came from a place of deep hurt and trauma brought upon by her, that this is still no excuse, but that in order for our relationship as siblings to start to be rebuilt, it would be great if she could take accountability and ownerhip, and acknowledge also at least some of her part in my trauma. She did not. I did my part, I also spoke to mom and told her I apologized and meant it (and i did, it's just sad we cant move forward). But now i am going LC with both of them. Partner supports my decision. That's it. Not a juicy messy update, just a sad one.\n\n-----\n\nOkay, so this has caused a huge fight in my family and I need outsode opinions. I (29F) have known for years that I want to name my future daughter Lena (short for Helena - gake name, just an example meaning a short name that stands for another longer name, like Beth for Elisabeth). It was my grandmother's name, who basically raised me while my mom worked 2 jobs and a side hussle. She passed when I was 17 and I’ve alqays known I wanted to honnor her if I ever had a daughter. I even have a little loket with her name engraved on it that I keep for that reason.\n\nMy older sister (34F who we'll call Jen) is currently 6 months pregnant with her first child. Jen just found out it’s a girl, and at diner last weekend she anounced that she’s naming the baby… Lena. I was kind of stunned and just said, “Wait! my Lena?” She looked confused and said, “Well, Grandma Lena, yeah. We all loved her.” I reminded her that I always said I would use that name and that it’s been “my baby name” forever. She basically said I don't own it, and that since she’s actualy having a baby first, she’s using it. I told her she coukd at least talked to me before anouncing it, and that I felt she did it on pirpose to hurt me. She rolled her eyes and said I’m being overly emotional and territorial about a name. My mom is backing her up, saying it’s just a name and that I should be happy our granfmother is being honnored. My boyfriend thinks it’s messed up but says I should just let it go to keep the peace. But I feel like my sister knew what that name meant to me and choose to took it first. I’m not even sure I want to talk to her right now.\n\nAITA for being upset and not wantung her to have the name? Lay it on me, do I just move on and honnor my granny another way?\n\n\n!!EDIT!!\n\nThank you to everyone who commented. I do appreciate the honest and blunt feedback.\n\nI wanted to add (said in a few comments) that we are trying to get pregnant, we are doing some fertility treatments which is why im hormonal a lot.\n\nPartner and I have decided that, IF (as everyone said) we do have a daughter, we will name her a variation of granny's name, a long version and slightly different spelling, so that we can still have our name we wanted and not have this fight in the family. I accept that its a stupid fight and i was the AH here, i cant call dibs, but anyway, i just was hoping my sister was done being petty to me, now that shes a grown adult.\n\nI also decided im gonna get a small tatoo in honnor of my granny, and one of my close cousins is also getting one to honnor our granny! Im learning to share the honnor for granny, thanks to all you people of reddit who called me out.\n\nIm gonna have a talk witj my sister and tell her im sorry for how i reacted and take her out for a tea, and try to put all this hurt and pain behind us...\n\nThanks again everyone!",

That being said she doesn’t own a name either and you can still call your future child “Lena” I would just say to your sister. “You’re right, I cannot own a name and you can call your child whatever you like but just be aware that logic goes two ways and no matter what you name your child if I have a daughter that child will be called Lena. That is not up for negotiation. If you name your child Lena you are naming her knowing that in the future I might also have a child called Lena and I don’t want to hear diddly squat from you about it. With that in mind I will not say anything more about your daughters name”",

I invited my partner (56M) -who has two children from another marriage- to come, but only if his daughter (12) was not in town. She would come in Saturday morning, he would work all Saturday day - leaving her home alone all day - and if he went to the dinner she would be home alone for the evening as well. She has confided in me that she hates visiting, and I just don't think she should have to come if he is going to leave her all day and night, what is the point? So I basically made the decision for him. He did not like this and acted like I was being unreasonable. He then attempted to argue that she should be invited. My friends do not have children and I do not think it appropriate. I blatantly said she is not invited. Am I the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "I (F, 30) am getting married in June. One of my friends/coworkers of almost 10 years just broke up with his gf last week. They’ve been slowly breaking up for the past year, but finally called it last week. They’ve been together for 6 years I think, so I know the ex decently well. She was friends with a couple of the girls in the group, but she and I never hung out one-on-one or even as two couples, I just saw her at group events. I also don’t like her very much. She is kind of a mooch and overall a very negative person. I also didn’t like how she spoke to my friend on numerous occasions (talking down to him) but was willing to be supportive while they were together. She also made my fiancé uncomfortable, like touchy sometimes. Now that they are broken up, she texted me and asked about her RSVP status. The website wouldn’t allow her to RSVP just for herself since she is attached to my friend as his date. She didn’t necessarily ask, she just said, “I am trying to RSVP for myself, if that’s okay with you.” I replied and expressed some compassion for the breakup, but since I’ve been friends with the male for a long time and I wanted him to be able to enjoy the event with all of our mutual friends who are also attending, I said I’d prefer if just he went. I also said it was a dynamic I was uncomfortable with on my wedding day, as it would presumably be the first time they saw each other post breakup since she flew back to another state to live with her family and they are no contact. I didn’t tell her this part, but I also have a medium sized wedding with many people on the backup list we would like to make room for that I actually want to see and interact with. She’s upset with me, understandably. But we don’t have a relationship outside of her now ex, and I didn’t want drama on my wedding day. Am I the asshole?",

I’m 20f and I’m ethnically Korean but grew up bouncing around different countries due to my parents job. My friend said that I’m “passively bilingual” in that I understand when my grandparents speak Korean to me, but I struggle to respond. Forget about reading or writing lol. My parents both grew up in the US and the grandparents I have left speak English so my bad Korean never caused any communication problems. \n\nMy parents gave me a “Korean name” and never gave me an “English name” (who knows why) even though a lot of ABCs usually go by an English name at school or work. This is fine by me, I like my name and yeah it sucked when some teachers got it wrong growing up, but that’s life. \n\nNow here’s the problem: I started a part time job and there’s another girl working there, Emma (fake name, maybe 25ishf?), is uncomfortable because of my name. Thing is, Emma is Muslim and takes her religion really seriously (she wears the hijab, prays at work) and apparently my name means something bad in her religion? She doesn’t call me by my name, it’s always “hey you” or something like that. \n\nShe recently complained to our manager, Jen (who really is just our equal with a nicer title) that my name is insulting to her religion. The two of them basically cornered me in the break room and asked if I can go by a nickname or an “English name.” I said no obviously but Emma and Jen think I’m not respectful of Emma’s religion and it’s not a big deal to use an English name since so many Asians do, and it’s not like I speak Korean or anything. \n\nI’m not sure if this is a hill worth dying on but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to go by another name???? AITA?\n\nEDIT: just got back to this post and I’m blown away by everyone’s support and wisdom🥹 Thank you all. I’m reading all of your comments and will think about what I will do next. I definitely do NOT wanna cave at this point. Some people have correctly guessed my name lol and im near tears over the sweet messages you’ve sent about it. Thank you again 🫶",

      "scenario_description": "My (36, M) sister (34, F) moved into my house about 2 months ago with her 2 kids (7M, 4F) after she ended a really bad relationship\n\nI’ve always been an early-ish riser and like to get up and make myself some breakfast around 7 or 8am. Nothing spectacular, just whatever I felt like that day\n\nWhen my sister moved in, I realized quickly that she liked to sleep in. Some days she was up as late as 1pm…I gave her the benefit of the doubt since I knew how hard her break up was for her \n\n\nSince my sister slept so late daily, she wouldn’t get up and take care of her kids. I got into a routine with my niece and nephew that basically whatever I cooked myself for breakfast, I’d make enough for them as well until the other morning \n\nI woke up and had an urge to make huevos rancheros. The kids immediately started complaining that they didn’t want that and wanted something different\n\nI was nice and ended up making them pancakes since it’s not their fault that their mom is really struggling \n\nThe next morning, I was making breakfast potatoes and eggs but all I heard was “we don’t want that. We want something different” so again, I obliged…finally after 3 mornings of my unwanted food critics getting a separate meal, I finally told them “I’m no longer cooking 2 different meals for breakfast. If you don’t like what I’m making, go ask your mom to get up and do it”\n\nSo, they went upstairs to wake her up, but she still didn’t come downstairs until after 1pm. The kids immediately started complaining that I “refused to feed them” and my sister was PISSED\n\nShe started in about how they need to be fed by a certain time and a bunch of other things that she said to try and intentionally hurt me\n\nI snapped and told her “look I know you’re depressed, but wake up and take care of your fu**ing kids instead of expecting me to do it”\n\nShe got quiet after that and is still giving me the cold shoulder, but I know she’s expecting me to apologize.\n\nSorry this was long winded, but let me have it. AITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I (32F) feel stuck between my husband (34M) and my family, and I don’t know if I handled this the right way.\n\nMy brother (30s) has always been the golden child in my mom’s eyes. He has several kids but barely parents them. My mom (60s) watches his children constantly while he sleeps, plays video games, or just disappears. Any time someone brings up how unfair this is, she makes excuses like “he’s just tired” or “he’s doing his best.” He rarely shows up to help, and everyone is expected to tiptoe around it.\n\nRecently things got worse. My husband owns his own business and works hard to provide for our family. After a dumb disagreement with my brother, my brother actually threatened my husband’s business. Like straight-up said he’d mess with it. Not even in a joking way.\n\nThen, he demanded my husband return the furniture we had bought and given him. This was stuff we purchased to help him when he was going through a tough time. It wasn’t a loan. It was a gift. But suddenly he was acting like we owed him something.\n\nSo yeah - my husband got mad. He made a comment about how my brother doesn’t do anything, never helps with his own kids, and how my mom constantly enables him. It was honest. Maybe a little harsh, but not inaccurate.\n\nI didn’t say anything. I didn’t defend my brother because honestly, my husband was right. I’ve felt that way for years but always kept quiet to avoid drama.\n\nLater, my mom pulled me aside and told me I should have stood up for my brother. She said I let my husband “disrespect family” and accused me of changing since I got married. She made me feel like I betrayed them by not taking my brother’s side.\n\nNow I feel completely torn. My husband is working hard, doing his part, and constantly getting disrespected. But my mom acts like I should cover for my brother no matter what.\n\nSo, AITA for not defending my brother when my husband called him out?\n\n\nEDIT- seeing a lot of people thinking I didn’t defend my husband, I left that part out bc I didn’t need judgement on if I was TA for doing that. My family and I haven’t spoke since this happened and I definitely had a screaming match with my mother after this happened. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (29M) have a newborn baby. My 9 year old sister - whom we'll call Kylie for privacy purposes, has been *so* excited to be an aunt for the first time. \n\n\nKylie has a physical disability, she struggles with fine motor tasks - and has a slight tremor in her hands when holding objects. Because of this, our mother stated that she did not want Kylie to hold the baby - ever. She kept saying how K's \"hands can't be trusted\" and that it would be best if she just looked at the baby. \n\n\nBut K was so excited to meet her new niece that I decided it was worth trying. With some assistance from me, she was able to hold her without issue. When our mother saw it happening, she was not happy. She said that it was irresponsible of me and repeated that Kylie's \"hands can't be trusted\" around the baby. She started talking about how when she says \"no\" as a parent, I need to respect that. \n\n\n\nAITA for letting my sister hold my baby, against our mother's wishes? ",

      "scenario_description": "My father has been a Reverend for 30 years. He and my mother are still married and they have two children - my sister and I. Neither my sister or I have good relationships with my parents. They weren't downright physically ab*sive, but both of them are definitely narcissists and some things they did left deep psychological scars that I still deal with to this day. \n\nIt has always been a running joke for my parents that my dad would perform our wedding ceremonies and Christen our children. This was SOP for my sister's wedding and the birth of her child. This, however, is not something that I want. I can't have my father preach to me and my husband-to-be about love when he has rarely shown it to me throughout my childhood. \n\nSo a few weeks ago, my fiancé and I were having dinner with them and we were discussing our plans for the future. My dad said something along the lines of \"I wonder what message I should give at your ceremony\" and I shot him down immediately, saying that I did not want him to perform the ceremony. He got mad and asked me to explain myself, almost like I had told him I had just k*lled someone. I told him that I still wanted him to walk me down the isle, which made him blow up even more. I finally said that he could choose between being my father or being my pastor. That was the end of the conversation and the end of dinner.\n\nNow he's demanding I apologize, because it's his right as my father to perform the ceremony. He's threatening not to pay for my wedding, and he's saying that if he doesn't perform the ceremony, he and my mother won't be attending.\n\nI am considering cutting all contact and eloping, but I'm scared that I would miss them when the big day comes.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Someone asked me, and we have had this discussion before dinner. It was a part of a larger discussion we had after my sister's wedding, where she said that he had basically forced her into him performing the ceremony, threatening to cut her off and not pay for the wedding. This is his go-to.\n\n2nd Edit (sorry, I am bad at this): I am not planning on asking him to pay for the wedding. My fiancé and I both want a small wedding and have seriously discussed eloping before this happened. So he is down with running away and just letting them know after.",

She asked why I couldn’t just skip practice, and I explained that we’re in preseason, and everybody is fighting for a spot on the team, and it wouldn’t be a good look for me skip practice. She wasn’t moved by this and was upset, saying she felt it was selfish for me to put soccer before her. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? I’ve explained to her a few times why I can’t just leave in the middle of preseason, but that if I can, I will definitely be down for her birthday. It’s also not like I’m ignoring her birthday. I made a reservation at a restaurant and we’re celebrating her birthday the week before I leave. Am I being selfish in this situation, or should she be more understanding of me?",

Wife is excluded from Bachelorette Party, I'm planning on skipping wedding and telling off the in-laws\n\nHonestly, my wife (and I) are almost always excluded from family activities or outings in one way or another.\nMy wife is literally the sweetest woman on Earth, (puts up with me), and has always been incredibly kind and patient as long as I've known her.\nWe flew into town from out of state for her brothers wedding this Friday. Last night we had over her soon-to-be SIL, all of her siblings that were able to make it, and her other brother's fiancee. That other fiancee and her two sisters were talking about going to Target tomorrow... To buy the new SIL a gift for her bachelorette party on Thursday. We were shocked. We came from out of state, and assumed since we hadn't heard anything that she had already had it before we got there, (which would have been fine and understandable,) but now it turns out that my wife, his oldest sister, wasn't invited, but the other two sisters, (one 26F and the other 17F), AS WELL as the other brother's fiancee, are all going.\n\nNot a WORD has been said to my wife about her being invited. When it got brought up, the two sisters acted like they got caught or something, didn't offer any consoling words, and changed the subject to my wife's health and how her kidneys are getting worse. 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️\n\nSo, what do you think? Am I overreacting to not go to the wedding after all, tell off my in-law for being jerks to my wife her whole life, and possibly stop coming to family events?",

      "scenario_description": "I (35f) have been with my husband Hank (38M) for 17 years and married for 12. We have 2 kids, Ruby (8F) and Lily (1F). Since the start of our relationship, H's mother Bev has been rude to me. On more than one occassion while she called me to verbally abuse me about some perceived slight that is either nothing to do with her or didn't even happen, for example celebrating my nephew's birthday in person with him (he lives an hour away) a week after we didn't celebrate hers with her (she lives 14 hours away).\n\nBev has a substance use problem and also likes to call Hank when she isn't sober and blame him for things that have gone wrong in her life, even if they have nothing to do with him, like when she got a flat tyre and it was because he hadn't called her in a few weeks. I wish I was making this up, apparently it was because he didn't care about her and so the universe was out to get her. He has gone NC with her in the past but eventually he starts taking her calls again.\n\nA few years ago she told him that our child (only Ruby at that point) should never have been born. At that point I was adamant that Bev would never have anything to do with Ruby, but eventually conceded that their contact could just be limited and supervised, as it was important to Hank. I also stated that Bev had to be sober for any and all interactions. It has been easy enough due to the distance and the fact that Bev won't travel to see us and we haven't really been able to travel in the past year. \n\nA few weeks ago, Bev called and Hank let her speak to Ruby on loudspeaker. I overheard and could tell that Bev was at least drunk, she was slurring her words and making some passive aggressive comments that hopefully went over Ruby's head. After Ruby went to bed I spoke to Hank about it and asked why he let her speak to her when she wasn't sober and he said he didn't realise, and that nothing she said was all that bad. We talked some more and he admitted that he didn't want conflict and she was adamant about talking to Ruby, and he thought it would be ok as she hadn't been nasty on that call.\n\nI told him I was no longer comfortable with Bev having any contact with Ruby because I don't feel like my boundaries were respected and I can't protect Ruby if the rules aren't followed. To his credit, he agreed with me and hasn't even attempted to let Bev talk to Ruby since. But a friend asked me how I would feel if Hank told me that my parents could never speak to Ruby again and now I'm questioning it. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "So I (M49) might be in the wrong here, but I honestly don’t think I am, and would love to hear outside perspectives.\n\nMy daughter (23F) got engaged recently and came to visit us with her fiancé (24M). We live a few states away, so I get that traveling is tiring, but we were happy to host, for the weekend.\n\nNow, I’ve had my guest room set up for my miniature wargaming for the past few years. It’s my space, where I go to decompress after work, and it's honestly the only spot in the house that's fully mine. My wife has the sunroom, and the rest of the house is kind of communal. I’ve got thousands of dollars of models in there, custom terrain, a 3D printer setup, etc. It’s not just a hobby, it’s an investment, and frankly, a form of art.\n\nAnyway, when they arrived, I had the office couch made up for them, pull-out, memory foam, decent blanket, very clean. My daughter seemed fine with it, but her fiancé kind of made a face and later asked why they couldn’t just sleep in the guest room. I told him plainly it wasn’t available because it’s not a guest room anymore. It’s my studio.\n\nLater that night, my daughter confronted me privately and said I was being selfish and ridiculous and that it’s just for two nights. She said they felt unwelcome and like I was prioritizing plastic figurines over family. I told her that’s not fair, they have a place to sleep. It’s not like I made them sleep on the floor.\n\nNow my wife is giving me the cold shoulder and said I could have just packed it up for a weekend, but again, it’s not like these are toys you throw in a box. Some of them are fragile. Some are half-painted. I don’t want to spend days reorganizing and then undoing all that work just because they didn’t like the setup.\n\nThey left a day early, and now I’m getting texts from my daughter about how I chose my hobby over her happiness, which just seems dramatic to me.\n\nI might be the asshole because maybe I could’ve moved some stuff around for a few nights, but I really don’t think it’s fair to expect me to dismantle my entire setup just because someone didn’t want to sleep on a perfectly good pull-out. I have a right to my space too, right?",

      "scenario_description": "I (35F) have been with my partner, Jamie (33M), for over six years and we’re getting married this fall. For most of our relationship, I’ve had a close bond with his brother, Matt (37M), and Matt’s wife, Claire (39F). We’ve shared holidays, dinners, hangouts, and I’ve always done what I could to support them, especially during hard times (I am the primary source of income).\n\nAbout two months ago, I bought a new car and offered them my old car ($6.5k). It was still in good working condition and they accepted it so I fully transferred it over to them. It was a genuine gift, from a place of love and support, and I was happy to help because they relied 100% on public transportation. Over the past years, I also gave small things, like household items, groceries, things for their kid… all meant kindly, never with any expectations.\n\nBut now things have shifted. Claire recently initiated a conversation where she said the gifts and emotional support I offered had felt “too much, overwhelming” etc., and even went as far as saying she felt I was using them to fulfill my own emotional needs. She said she no longer feels comfortable around me and wants to limit contact (i.e. don't text them unless they text first) and “slow down”. This completely blindsided me! I was never given any indication before that she felt this way.\n\nOne example Claire brought up really confused me. They have a shy cat, Shadow, who hides whenever we visit. We've never seen her in person and it became a running joke between me and Jamie that she \"might not actually exist\"; a reference to the M&M Christmas commercial (“He does exist!”). Claire said she found that joke offensive, like we were mocking a traumatized animal. That felt like a major overreaction to something lighthearted and affectionate.\n\nNow here’s the part that’s really been weighing on me: Claire and Matt have made it clear they don’t want any more gifts or support and that our relationship needs distance. Gifts for their kid are okay. And they’re still happy to keep the car I gave them… something that came from a time when our relationship was close, warm, and mutual.\n\nTo be clear, I haven’t asked for the car back. But I’ve been thinking about sending a message, not demanding anything, but pointing out the emotional disconnect: that they’ve rejected ongoing support, suggested past support was not genuine yet have no issue keeping such a significant gift: the car. I want to ask them to reflect on what that means.\n\nJamie is supportive of whatever decision I make, but he’s worried this might further rupture things with his family. His mom also relies on Matt and Claire for transportation to our wedding, and he’s concerned that asking for the car back… or even just bringing it up… might make that more complicated.\n\nSo… WIBTA for wanting to ask them to reflect on this? Or even possibly asking for the car back?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi! This happened in Brazil, but I'm posting here so my friends don't find it. \n\nI (23F) live with seven other people, two girls and five boys (one of them is my boyfriend). We are all between 22-25. We started renting together three years ago when we were all in the same university and just kept doing it.\n\nWe split rent and utilities equally. We are all at least friendly with each other and regularly have parties/travel together, but we are not all that close. \n\nRecently, during a party, we were all a bit drunk and were talking about funny stories from our families and I commented that I studied in a very elite school in our city. One of the boys, Jay(25), was very surprised because it is a very expensive school. He started asking me questions about the way I grew up and eventually just said \"wow you are rich\". I thought that was it and we kept having fun.\n\nWell, the morning after, he started making all these jokes about me being rich and snobby, which I didn't mind, we tease each other all the time. But after like three days it started annoying people so one of the girls, Maria (24F), told him to cut it out because he was overdoing it.\n\nThis started an argument and eventually it came out that he was uncomfortable with the revelation that my parents had money. We started talking about it, (it was super awkward because it sucks having a serious conversation at breakfast), and he said that he truly felt betrayed because he thought we were all broke and that to make things fair I should have been making bigger contributions to the house funds\n\nI said that I understood he was upset, but that I couldn't really afford paying the amount he was suggesting (R$1800). He insisted and my boyfriend got involved and eventually he just left while saying I was a liar.\n\nWell, my other six friends don't agree with him and think he's being a dick, and now he's being kind of sidelined for the past week, but I can't help wondering if he's right. I never lied about how I grew up, but I knew that just the fact both my parents have a master's meant that I grew up better off than everyone else from this group, and I kind of avoided commenting about it because I thought it was awkward. Most people knew, but apparently Jay and our other friend didn't. AITA for not paying more?",

      "scenario_description": "My mother texted my oldest sister and I that we will be going to a restaurant on Friday (yesterday). I agreed and made sure to free up my evening. \n\nCome Friday, we were 11 persons (2 families) at the table, including my grandma, aunt, uncle and cousins. Near the end of the dinner, my sister stood up and went away somewhere. When she came back, she had a receipt in her hand, so my mom asked if that's the bill she was holding. My sister announced that she went to pay and that me and her were treating the table today for Mother's day. I was shocked because we never discussed that. She handed me the bill and asked me to e-transfer her half of the total ($350 /2 = $175). \n\nBack in our place, I told my sister that I couldn't afford that with all the bills and that I did not agreed to split the bill beforehand. She then proceeded to say that I'm ungrateful for our mom and that as the older children in the group, we need to foot the bill. \n\n  \nFor more context, since the end of last year, I no longer live with my parents. I am in my 20s and currently live with my oldest sister, mainly because she wanted to move out and couldn't afford paying the mortgage/bills by herself, so my parents made me move out with her. (At the time, i didn't realize how expensive that will be.) My sister has now a 6-figure job and I have a waaay lower income, and basically living paycheque by paycheque. That is no excuse for me not to pay, but wanted to point out our different financial realities. \n\n\n\nI haven't paid her yet, but AITA for not wanting to split the bill?",

      "scenario_description": "A guy I’ve been seeing invited me to have dinner with him and a married couple he’s friends with last week.\n\nThe dinner was mostly uneventful, they were polite and we had good conversation. Towards the end of the evening, I excused myself to go to the restroom and on my way there, accidentally knocked a trinket bowl off the edge of the counter, and it broke.\n\nI let the hosts know, was greatly apologetic, and I offered to replace the bowl. Originally they had said it was fine and that was sort of the end of it. I was an embarrassed by the situation but just did my best to put it in the back of my mind and that was that.\n\nSkip a few days, and my date gets a text from the husband, asking if I can replace the bowl. Date let me know, obviously not a big deal but I was a bit worried since this couple is clearly in a different tax bracket than me. \n\nHusband and I exchanged information and Lo and behold the bowl is nearly $1500. Not going to lie I kind of shit my pants on that one. It also made me slightly upset, because while it was my mistake…. Who precariously places a bowl *that* expensive on the edge of a counter??? \n\nI let him know that I didn’t have that much disposable money, but asked if they would be willing to accept a payment plan, or give me some time to save. Up till then he’d been polite, but it quickly turned into “your lack of finances is not our concern” and they suggested I open a credit card in that case to purchase the bowl immediately and pay it back later on my own time with interest.\n\nI barely just paid off the veterinarian debt I had racked up on my credit card and shot down that option. Date is on my side and considering no longer speaking to them over this since the bowl didn’t have any significance to them. Family is completely on my side. I feel terrible about it all, but just don’t see opening another credit card as an actual option here. Wondered what Reddit would think since I’ve never had a conflict worthy of a post.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "A few months ago my sister and law and her daughter who is 3 came to stay with us for nearly a week because she is getting assessed for autism in our state. I had suggested to my partner that they stay in a hotel, even offered that we cover the costs because my SIL is what I could only call a free range mom. She is struggling and is likely trying to do whatever will make the day go by.\n\n Anyway they visited and we have a 4 year old son. He has his routines, we have our rules at home, aside from our weekly movie night he doesn’t access any other screen time and doesn’t have a personal device. My SIL’s kid was glued to her iPad the entire time, volume on loud and if my SIL tried lowering the volume the kid would start screaming, it seems that the SIL never actually carried through with it.\n\nWe tried to be accommodating, she sat at the dinner table with us for dinner on her iPad our son was very curious and at first we were like this is a good opportunity for him to understand some people do things differently for whatever reason.\n\nBut by day three, it was clear that this wasn’t just about the kid getting used to a different environment, it was full-blown chaos. Constant screaming and banging well into the night, the iPad on loud until nighttime too. It kept everyone up. We have a large 5 bedroom home and we all stayed up because of it including our son who could not sleep until he asked to stay in our room. I occasionally WFH but just couldn't and had to leave.\n\nThe lack of boundaries extended to other areas too. My SIL would say she was stepping out for a walk and be gone for hours, leaving her daughter with us with no heads up or prep. And I want to be clear, I have so much empathy. I know parenting a child with additional needs is exhausting. I know she likely never gets a break. But I didn’t sign up to be free childcare, especially when we were already hosting them, driving them around, buying a lot of additional frozen food and snacks that we never keep at home so that the daughter could eat. All while trying to maintain some structure for our own kid.\n\nMy partner and I argued about it afterward. He felt I was being too harsh, I said, if they need to come again for another assessment, we either book and pay for a hotel if they really can’t afford it or set very clear boundaries about what kind of help we’re able to offer, and stick to them.\n\nNow my SIL needs to come to our state again and has asked to stay for the few days she is here. My partner thinks I’m being unkind and unsupportive, but I honestly think we did everything we could last time and hosting again is just too stressful. So I said no.\n\nAITA for saying no to hosting them overnight again?",

      "scenario_description": "Separated Parents/ 1 child. I pay my 50% of our child’s private school fees (not a small amount of money) to their other parent directly and TMK they paid the entire lot from their bank account.\n\nRecently, the other parent has been quite negatively explosive toward me telling me that we aren’t friends, they hate me and they think the way that I portray myself is disgusting and bullshit but also not to contact them unless it was directly about our child. It all seemed to come out all at once but I genuinely don’t know where it came from. The only thing I can think of is that they’ve heard about our little one’s outfit in my upcoming wedding. Some really horrible things were said and I haven’t spoken to them since and it’s going to take a long long time for me to trust them or even be on board/same page with them again.\n\nFor 8 years we’ve been civil with little issues. We’ve even also done many joint birthday parties together and we’ve been welcome in each other’s homes on any given day. We’ve always done the very best for our child. We’ve both moved on with other people and families. Theirs had a breakdown a few years ago but now has a new partner whilst I’m getting married in a few months. It’s never been a problem with our particular dynamic. They do however make rude comments about myself and my fiancé and how family life is our only life and that we have nothing better to do 🙄 but otherwise, I’ve never been overly discouraged. I’m quite tolerant of barely tolerable people. I’ve just gotten on with the fact that the other parent didn’t want to be a family with me, the didn’t want me and I moved on. Granted, that did take me a long time with a lot of pain and heartache to do but I finally got there.\n\nSchool fees are due next week and I don’t  want to be giving the other parent my money, so instead of paying directly to the other parent as I want my share of the fees paid by me documented directly and correctly, I’ve paid with the payment details on the invoice and now according to the other parent, I’ve done them a disservice regarding their education loans and their finances which I knew nothing about… but why would me paying my 50% share of our child’s school fees directly to the school have anything to do with the other parents educational loans and finances? They definitely haven’t paid the fees upfront so it’s not as though they’d be reimbursing themselves but even still, why would a loan be taken out in the full amount of school fees when half are already paid by me?\n\nIt was only when they felt the need to remind me that I owed them money in a few days, that I told them I’d already paid my share (honouring them asking me to not contact them… cause why would I want to after being told I’m hated?)\n\nChild Support is not something we get involved in as we have our child 50/50 and finances don’t ever come into play. AITA for wanting my half share documented from here on out? Happy to hear opinions and ways it can be addressed in the future.",

      "post_title": "AITA for uninviting my old headteacher / mum’s BF to my wedding?",
      "scenario_description": "I’m (26F) getting married to my fiance (29M) in September. We’ve invited partners for close friends and family but haven’t given any blanket plus ones, if that’s relevant.\n\nMy mum (56F) has been really excited for the wedding. A few weeks ago we went out for lunch for Mother’s Day with her and my sister and she told us that she’s seeing someone, a former teacher called Henry who is now retired. She was smitten. Apparently they’ve been seeing each other since November but she was anxious to tell us about it - this is the first time she’s seen anyone since Dad died six years ago and she said she was worried about how we’d react. I was really happy for her - Dad’s been dead quite a while and I think the loneliness has affected her quite badly. After talking about her new BF we got talking about the wedding again, and obviously i said her new partner would be invited.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, my fiancé and I went to visit mum and meet her new partner. When we got inside, my old headteacher was sitting on the sofa and jumped up to greet us. For a second I blanked and was confused about why he was there before realising that he was Henry. \n\n“Henry” is Mr Campbell, my old headteacher. He was head from when I was in year 10 to upper sixth. He hated me. I wasn’t a particularly bad kid and occasionally got in trouble, but a lot of the stuff he pulled me up for was just trivial. As an example: He called my dad in for a behaviour meeting because I’d been caught wearing two pairs of school socks (this sounds weird but we had big woollen blue socks and they looked better with two pairs scrunched down, but it was against uniform policy). In that meeting with my dad he also had a go at me for not having an expression on my face, saying how bad it was that I could “just sit there like it wasn’t affecting me”. Like he wanted to make me cry or upset or something. He also said he’d asked my teachers and they’d all given reports that I have an attitude and misbehave in class (none of my reports said that though 🤔). My dad was horrified and wouldn’t speak to me for a couple of days. Once I was on his radar, Mr Campbell took any opportunity to try and find something wrong with my uniform or what I was doing so he could give me a detention.\n\nAfter the initial moment of confusion he introduced himself as Henry, then made a joke about having my top button undone (I was wearing a blouse). It was super uncomfortable. He still talked as if I was a teenager. We left after about half an hour of uncomfortable chat. All the drive home i couldn’t stop thinking about the wedding and how much I DONT want this guy there. I don’t want to feel judged and disliked on my wedding day. I don’t know how to tell Mum though - I know it’ll hurt her feelings, she obviously feels for him (why, I’m not sure) and I don’t want to give the impression that I have a problem with her dating in general. On the other hand I don’t want to have someone who hates me at my wedding.\n\nWIBTA?",

The first sign was an empty vape box inside of her car, but i thought nothing of it at first because she was a heavy smoker prior to her pregnancy. \n\nHowever, the second sign was finding a vape in our bed. It wasn’t there when i made the bed earlier that day, and then right there next to her, i find the vape while she was sleeping.   i asked her if she was still smoking it and she laughed and said no. i don’t try to pry so i left it there, thinking she wouldn’t be intentionally (potentially) harming our unborn child. \n\nFast forward to today, i walk past our sons room (we have a 5 year old) but unbeknownst to her i seen her hit the vape and i immediately ask her what did i just see her do. \n\nNow I’ll spare the conversation after that and what transpired, but am i the asshole? I’m being ignored and treated as so, for pointing out and questioning the obvious. ",

      "scenario_description": "My [F34] husband's [M39] niece [F11] was recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Her mother [F41] is exploring private schools as an option for our niece, and she asked my husband for help covering the tuition. My husband had impulsively offered to help pay for private school two years ago, when we heard that our niece was having debilitating meltdowns in school. At the time, his sister did not have a need for it yet, because our niece was still in elementary school.\n\nMy sister in law is the breadwinner in the family. When she married her husband, she was in her early 30s and had never found a full time job. They had our niece about a year after the wedding. Her husband [M46], my brother in law, worked as a financial analyst for his dad's friend's firm at the time of their marriage. He was laid off when my niece was about a year old. This was his only job, and he has failed to get another job since.\n\nHe struggled with depression and each time he started the job search, he would get discouraged rejections. His family is fairly wealthy, so his parents have supported them throughout the years by helping them with two down payments.\n\nMy sister in law got a temp job six years ago. They have since had a second kid. It's enough to keep food on the table for the family of four, and both sets of grandparents gift them with the yearly vacation.\n\nNow that our niece is entering middle school next year, my husband's sister is asking him for help. I am NOT ok with covering tuition entirely while her husband continues to not work. Would I be the asshole if I asked my husband to require that they contribute a significant (half? A bit less than half?) of the tuition?\n\nWe love our niece and ache to see her struggle like this. My husband didnt consult with me first when he initially made the offer, and he apologized later that night and said that he should have asked me.\n\nI am supportive of helping, and his big heart and generosity is one of many reasons why I fell in love with him in the first place. We're both in high paying jobs and don't have kids yet, but we will likely need the help of IVF in the future-- we can afford to help our niece and pay for IVF, but it will come with sacrifices on our part. My husband also works 18 hour days, and it pains me to see him pull all nighters a every other week knowing that the brother in law sends the kids to after school day care and doesn't seem to do much at home to help my husband's sister.\n\nWhat's a fair way to manage these feelings of resentment, while making sure that our niece doesn't get the short shrift because of her father's issues?\n",

      "scenario_description": "**My wife (30 yo woman) and I (31 yo man) have been together for 11 years, and we got married almost 3 years ago. Last year, we decided that we wanted to try to have a child together. So we were very happy when, a few months later, we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, which was very difficult for both of us, but we got through it together.**\n\n**Shortly after, we put ourselves on a waiting list to adopt a dog. We both love animals and had always wanted to have a dog together.**\n\n**A few months went by, and we received the news that we were pregnant again. This pregnancy seems to be going better, and we are expecting the baby in October. Around the same time, we also found out that a new litter of puppies would be born soon and that we had been selected to adopt one. The puppy is expected to be born in June, which means we could bring it home in August or September.**\n\n**I told my wife that I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of training a puppy at the same time we’re having a baby. We both have busy jobs and active social lives, and I just don’t see how we can manage raising a dog while also adjusting to parenthood. Don’t get me wrong, I still want to adopt a dog — but I’d prefer to wait a few months or even years until we’ve settled into life with our baby.**\n\n**My wife dismissed these concerns and said we’d be able to handle it. Shortly after, she even sent a message to the breeder saying that we were still very interested in adopting a puppy.**\n\n**We’ve now reached the point where we’re starting to tell our friends and family that we’re expecting. We’ve received lots of excited congratulations, but also questions about how we’re going to juggle our busy lives with both a baby and a puppy. Whenever I’m asked this, I say that it’s also a concern of mine, but that my wife is determined to get a puppy now, while I’d prefer to wait.**\n\n**Twice now, in response to this, my wife has said that she would choose a puppy over a baby. The first time, I laughed it off as a joke. But when she said it again in front of my family, I reacted angrily. I found it incredibly disrespectful to our unborn child.**\n\n**On the way home, I told my wife that I thought she was being very selfish and that, at this point, I no longer want to adopt a dog — at least not until after the birth of our child. This has since led to quite a bit of arguing and tears. AITA?**",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway because my brother and dad have redit. \n\n\nI (25F) have a brother (36M) and a SIL (37F) with four kids—8M, 5M, 3F, and 1.5F. I’m super involved in their lives. I babysit regularly, help with pickups, school stuff, sick days, family grocery shopping and basically function as their go-to extra  set of hands. The kids all call me auntie or Lili, a nickname that stuck when the oldest couldn’t pronounce my name as a baby. Lately, though, the younger two have started calling me Mama or mama Lili sometimes. I always gently correct them something think “I’m Lili, sweetie, not Mama” every single time. I try to redirect them But I also don’t scold them or make it a huge deal because, they’re babies, and I do take care of them a lot. When I told my brother and SIL about it, they both said not to stress. They’re fine with it, they know I’m not trying to take anyone’s place, and they understand that little kids sometimes blur lines with caregivers. So I just kept gently correcting them and moved on. I have asked my SIL multiple times about it and she has always said something along the lines of \"I'm happy they can have 2 \"mom's\" or \"if anyone else deserves to be called mom too it's you \". I still redirect but not always depending on the situation.\n\nThen came the fam BBQ. The 3y ran up to me, with a big hug, and said, “Mama, I want juice.” I did what I always do, I smiled and said“I’m Auntie Lili remember moms over there?” Totally casual But my mom overheard and instantly flipped her lid.And I mean full meltdown in front of everyone yelling that I was confusing the children, crossing lines, trying to play mommy, and disrespecting the real parents. She said I should’ve “nipped this in the bud” and accused me of trying to insert myself into a role that wasn’t mine. I calmly told her their actual parents were fine with it and that I gently correct the kids almost every time but she wasn’t hearing it.But what is frustrating is my brother stood there and said absolutely nothing.  No defense, no “Hey Mom, chill”nothing. Eventually I walked away with the 3y who was now very much upset because she felt like she did something wrong. Now my mom is justifying her behavior by telling extended family that she always could tell I’m trying to “replace” their mother and calling me disrespectful and that IV always had \"too much of a hand\" in their family. \n\nI love those kids, and I do correct most of the time. I’m just not going to scream at a toddler over a slip-up. Also I don't love what she's trying to imply because he my brother???\n So… AITA for not shutting down my nephews and niece for calling me mama even tho the parents said not to worry? ",
