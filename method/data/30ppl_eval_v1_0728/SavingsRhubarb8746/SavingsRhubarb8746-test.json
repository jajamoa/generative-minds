      "scenario_description": "I don't know where to start. I will try to keep this as short and simple as possible, but it is kind of a long story. I am quite nervous to post this because I don't look the best in this story. \n\nLast July, my brother (29M, I will call him \"Sam\" without using his real name) was getting really bad headaches and migraines. It turns out that he has a tumor in his brain. It is intertwined with essential brain structures, basically meaning that it cannot be removed. His prognosis was a year. \n\nSam told me and our parents, and we were devastated to receive this news. This is where it gets complicated: Sam has a little six year old girl, who I'll call \"Lily.\" He is a single father, and he REFUSED to tell her. I could not disagree with this more. My parents also agree that Lily deserves to know, but they don't insist on telling her against Sam's wishes. \n\nWell, I snapped on Sunday. It was late like 2 AM late. Lily is calls me and is screaming and crying because \"daddy fell and won't wake up.\" I guess she doesn't know to call 911. I tell her I will be right there and then I call 911. \n\nAt their house, Lily is sobbing and has no idea why Sam passed out because she still doesn't know. Long story short, at the hospital, the doctors tell me and my parents that Sam had a seizure and the severity of his condition is accelerating faster than they'd like. \n\nAfter all this chaos, I bring Lily to my house and sit down with her. I tell her, as gently and kid-friendly as I can, that daddy is very sick and is unfortunately going to pass away soon. It was so hard to tell her, and she didn't take the news well. She started crying and banging her head on the wall because she doesn't want him to leave. This broke my heart and I started to regret telling her. \n\nSam called me a few days later, pissed. \"Why did I tell Lily?\" \"I wasn't ready for her to know yet.\" \"She hasn't come out of her room all day.\" \"It wasn't yours to tell.\" \n\nFrom what I've heard and seen, Lily doesn't talk to Sam and I can see their relationship is strained. I feel horrible, but I also feel that Lily needed to know what Sam wasn't telling her. What if he had died that night? She would be traumatized and I don't want that for her. \n\nSam isn't talking to me. Lily is not talking to me. I feel awful. But she needed to know, didn't she?\n\nAITA?",

You could have spoken again, after the seizure, with your brother, trying to convince him to tell her that he's sick and won't be getting better. He also needs to write a will and name a guardian for her. \n\nBut to dump all that on a six-year-old, and then apparently she had to deal with this on her own, back in her own home, with a dying father who didn't even know that you'd decided to tell her, was a massive overstep.",

      "scenario_description": "AITA\n\nBefore I begin i am sorry for the formating, i am on the mobile app\n\nSo today I asked one of my teachers to lie to my mother\n\n*Backstory*\nBefore classes finished today, two friends from different grades asked me to hang out, to which I agreed. So everything is going great until I checked the clock on my phone, and realised I didn't have enough time to get to my bus station to get on my bus( i live outside of the city i study in, so my busses have 1hour in-between them). My narcissistic mother called asking where I was, I panicked and lied to her that I was helping one of my teachers that I've always been close with finish a project for the student Council. She believed me, so I didn't really worry all that much. I caught my next bus and got home. My mother was waiting for me and she started asking questions and threatening me to text my teacher to ask her if what i was saying was true. I panicked again, because I knew I would be in some deep shit if she texted my teacher, so I decided to text her myself(in the country i live in it's normal to have your teachers personal phone numbers). I texted her, asking if she could lie to my mother and she said that she was in a really embarrassing situation, because by law she couldn't. I started explaining what happened, how I lost track of time and how she mad at me. She agreed, but said that we needed to talk on Monday. The thing is I think my mother was only threatening me, because she has done it before to get me to confess. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking my teacher to lie to my mother?",

It is bad enough to call asking for a visit of so many people only a month and a half after you move in; to show up immediately, even earlier than they had asked about is outrageous. Then a fifth relative wants to show up....\n\nTalk privately with your wife, make it clear that this is incredibly disruptive, and that her sister must be told she cannot come from a weekend (you can tell her you'll make the call if she doesn't want to lay down the law herself). Then the other four - whatever their current leave date (NOT including the \"1 more night\"), they have to stick to it.\n\nI don't know if your wife likes having them all there, or is also at her wits' end hosting so many people while moving into a new home and caring for a small child. You are not unreasonable to want some limits. Your first priority must be to get them all out, with the agreement of your wife. Then, when things have calmed down a bit, you and your wife can negotiate on rules for house guests - none during the work week sounds reasonable, and agreement IN ADVANCE between you and your wife before ANY invitation is offered is another good rule. If she's got a habit of giving way to her relatives, she can practice saying \"You want to stay here for the month of August? I'm not sure we'll be able to manage that; I'll talk it over with Husband and let you know\". Anyone who shows up unexpectedly (unless they're fleeing a fire or a hurricane with only the clothes on their back) can be told \"I wish you'd let us know you were planning on coming, and we could have warned you that this wasn't a good time for us. I believe the Holiday Inn in the next town is nice.\"\n\nDo you live in a mansion, or perhaps near a beach or some other major tourist attraction??",

      "scenario_description": "Aita! My friend was my passenger in a car accident I caused. We both have minor bruises and scratches along with being soar. She wants to get a lawyer because she wants to benefit from the accident, she refused medical attention the day of the accident and two days later still no medical attention. I keep asking her to go be and get checked out. She came to me and told me she talked to a lawyer and she told her how much she could get for pain and suffering. I was explaining to her that she doesn't need a lawyer because her injuries are minor and she would be potentially screwing over the person I hit and ultimately getting me sued by the other person. I did tell her she has every right to get medical help and should. However I told her that she should not see this a benefit to getting her paid, she keeps saying that its all insurance but seems to not understand what could happen if she gets a lawyer.\n\nUpdate- thank you all for the comments, I want to show this. Hopefully she doesn't feel attacked. Ultimately, I want her to her the help she needs without taking advantage of the situation as a way to get ahead. ",

I can barely remember it being a thing but we were so young it didn’t have too much impact in the long run. \n\nWe’ve never spoken to him except as we were growing up he’d follow us on socials and would try to start conversations with awkward Happy Birthdays we entertained him until he tried to ask for money one time so we kinda ignored him since. \n\nI don’t think anybody in our family has really kept up with him including our Dad except maybe our Aunt who’d give us random updates about him here and there pretty sure he’s 23 or 24\n\nAnyway my Dad has unfortunately passed somewhat unexpectedly but he was an older guy, don’t want to get into it tbh. But It’s been about 4 months since and me and my sister have been staying at his house that’s passed to us and figuring all the other stuff out \n\nWe recently got a formal letter from the HB’s lawyer (which I’m pretty sure is just his friend but that’s besides the point) asking for his portion of everything, so we were practically forced to meet with him where he gave us a sob story about how he needed help and a place to stay or he’d take us to court. So basically forcing our hand to make a choice soon.\n\nI think it’s ridiculous to let a stranger basically into our home and lives like this but the alternative is selling everything if we were forced to give him stuff. My aunt says I’m being an asshole and that he’s no different from a distant relative at worst but I feel like he has bad intentions or something and honestly I think it’s wrong for him to swoop in and lay claim to a place he’s never step foot in and ask help from people he dosent even know I bet he’s been waiting for this for a while now. Anyway what do y’all think?\n\n\nIf you need info ask feels like I’ve been typing forever jeez\n\nEdit/update - Sorry got busy, but unfortunately there’s no clear will left behind, but we did find out that my mother had paid many of the mortgages on the house so much much more ground to stand on. \n\nEdit 2 - SO MANY COMMENTS, I think I’ll do little mini thoughts and update type things just on my profile also to just write down my thoughts without subreddit restrictions. Maybe after everything is over I’ll drop a final update in this sub we’ll see (I’ll try to reply to some mrle comments on here ",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 17, just finished Year 12, and I’ve been set on applying to this one uni (Russell Group) since around Year 10. It’s my dream. I picked my A-levels for it, did summer schools, loads of volunteering, all of that. I’ve worked towards this for years.\n\nA few months ago, my friend (also 17) asked me where I was thinking of applying, and I told her all about this course and how much I loved the uni. She hadn’t even mentioned it before. She had a completely different list.\n\nBut ever since I told her, she’s suddenly obsessed. Now she’s saying she wants to apply to the exact same course at the same uni. The thing is, we’re basically identical on paper. Same subjects, same grades, same extracurriculars.\n\nI got really anxious about it and told her I felt uncomfortable. I said I didn’t want to compete with someone so close to me, especially when I’ve been working toward this for years and she only started thinking about it a few months ago. I asked if she’d maybe consider applying elsewhere, just because it means a lot to me and I didn’t want to feel like we’re going head to head over something that personal.\n\nShe got really upset and said I don’t own a uni and that she can apply wherever she wants. And now a few people from school are saying I was out of line and that I’m being controlling or just scared of competition.\n\nI get that I can’t stop anyone applying where they want, and maybe it is selfish of me. But I honestly just feel kind of betrayed and stressed out by the whole thing.\n\nAITA?\n",

I didn’t have any ill intentions in asking. My questions were regarding when the umbilical cord/ placenta/ amniotic fluid will finally leave her system. \n\nIf she stubbed her toe and I asked when she can expect the swelling to go down, no one would act like I was being rude. If I asked when will the bump go away seven months later, when it’s clearly weight, it would be rude. \n\nI ended up apologizing at the urging of my other friends. But, while I understand that they were offended by my question, I still think it was a reasonable thing to ask. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My sister does this thing where she'll just say something she wants with the expectation that someone will do it for her. For example, if she wants the AC turned on, instead of asking someone to turn it on for her, she'll keep repeating things like \"Oh, isn't it super warm in here?\", \"Does anyone else feel really hot?\" or \"I heard that today is a super hot day!\" and if someone asks her if she wants the AC on, she'll reply with \"No, no, I'm good! But if *you're* hot then you should turn it on!\"   \n  \nAnyways, last weekend it was my birthday so my family and I went out to celebrate. During the meal, she kept making comments implying that she wanted another cocktail, but wouldn't order it. The waitress even came by and asked if we needed anything, but she didn't order a drink even when we all did. I could tell she was agitated at that point, but it was my birthday so I just ignored her. \n\nWhen we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we \"let\" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying \"no\" to the waitress because her family should've \"taken care of her\" (her words, not mine). \n\nThe three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.

Sure, there ARE occasions when it's polite to ask everyone at the table if they want a drink or want the air conditioning turned up or down, but it's also polite to speak to the waitress on your own if she's standing at the table asking if anyone wants a drink.

      "scenario_description": "My sister (26f) got married last month and I (29f) thought everything went ok. She had a beautiful venue, but I thought her wedding was a bit trashy.\n\nHer dress was beautiful if cheap. It was a midi dress with off the shoulder sleeves. I advised her to cover her arms because she’s got a “patchwork” tattoo sleeve on her left arm and I asked her if she really wanted a mouse in a party hat or a cowboy cat in her wedding photos. To which she said, “I think it’ll look sick as hell.”\n\nShe looked beautiful on her wedding day aside from her tattoos and the bit of rodent pee she got on her dress from when she insisted on taking pictures with her “babies”.\n\nThen for the reception she ordered pizza and had a Walmart sheet cake. Why? So she could spend money on a bounce house and ballpit.\n\nI thought the worst part of her wedding was that she didn’t allow kids to come to save money and because in her words “kids can be attention whores”. So I had to pay $100 for a sitter in addition to the $200 I gave them as a wedding gift.\n\nAt the end of the night, she and a bunch of party guests ended up jumping into the pool at her hotel because she “thought it would be fun” and bribed the night manager at the hotel to open the pool again so they could swim for a bit which I thought was rude. So her wedding dress and her husband’s suit was ruined from that.\n\nYesterday, we were going through the photos and she said that she had the time of her life and everything went perfect. I mentioned that I thought it was a bit immature and she said I was just a stick in the mud and if I could let loose for 5 minutes, I could’ve had fun too. I tried to show her where I was coming from but her husband stepped in and said if I didn’t have anything nice to say, I shouldn’t say anything at all and that even his 5th grade students knew that. I didn’t say anything else about it but what she said still kinda hurts.\n\nAITA for saying that I though my sisters wedding was immature and trashy?",

      "scenario_description": "My husband (35M) and I (35F) recently built a new house.\n\nMy FIL is a professional contractor and he was the contractor for our house build. My BIL (husband's brother) is a carpenter and he also worked on our house full time during the build. So it was definitely a family project. My FIL and BIL are both really nice people and I'm grateful for both of them.\n\nHowever, my SIL (34F, husband's sister), is a miserable and rude person. There are times she has been so rude to me that family has had to step in and tell her to stop. A lot of her rude comments have been related to the fact that my husband and I don't have any kids yet (we plan to start trying for a baby next year). SIL feels strongly that women should have kids when they are in their 20's. She has told me that I'm going to have miscarriages, my kids are going to be autistic/have down syndrome, I'm going to be an old mom etc because my husband and I decided to wait until our 30's to have kids.\n\nIn the past when we have had SIL over to our house, she only makes rude comments and never has anything nice to say. When we hosted a birthday party for my husband (in our old house), SIL walked in the door, looked around, and said \"wow, your house is actually clean or once\". SIL stopped by our new house when it was under construction and her only comment was \"I can't believe how small your new house looks\".\n\nSIL doesn't live close by (thankfully). She will be visiting my MIL and FIL this summer. It's the first time she has visited since our house build was completed.\n\nMy FIL and BIL are proud of the house and want to show it off. And I want them to be able to show it off. I'm really grateful for the work they put into the house. There are a bunch of other family members that will be visiting this summer and I'm happy to take all of them through the house.\n\nBut, given our history, I'd rather not have SIL through the house. My in-laws know SIL and I aren't on good terms. I'm sure SIL will want to see the house, but I doubt she will ask my husband or I directly if she can come by. She will most likely get MIL to ask my husband or I if they can stop by.\n\nWIBTA if I told her that she can't view our new house?",

She'll be delighted to have ammunition to use against you (behind your back if she can't meet you) and will happily tell everyone she meets how awful and rude you are. And she won't change whatever you do. \n\nWhat about unintended consequences? You're sure to offend your FIL and BIL, and it doesn't sound like you want to do that.\n\nYTA to be rude, but there are other things you can do. I've seen good suggestions in the comments. I've always found trying to keep a straight face in front of her and making a joke about her comments after she leaves works, but once in a while a nice straight comment, when I can think fast enough and get the right tone, is even better. Polite skepticism - \"Really? We've done a lot of research on pregnancies and didn't get that impression\" (but DON'T allow her to then offer \"references\" probably found on TikTok; change the subject\". House cleanliness? Either claim to enjoy the lived-in look or take her literally when she says it's finally clean \"Oh thank you, yes it cleans up nice, doesn't it?\"\n\nI once shut up an inlaw from one of her interminable rants about how my side of the family were making her life a misery by suggesting she get a divorce (in a very innocent and helpful tone)>",

      "scenario_description": "I (28F) got invited to a birthday party for a mutual friend, “Jess” (28F). I was actually looking forward to it, but then I found out “Chloe” (28F) is coming too. She’s an ex-friend who, honestly, wrecked me last year by spreading some nasty, totally made-up rumors. It messed up my reputation with our friend group and, yeah, it sucked. I’ve cut her off since then.\r\n\r\nSo, I messaged Jess privately and explained. Literally told her, “Jess, I really want to celebrate with you, but I’m not comfortable being around Chloe after everything she did. I hope you get it, but I can’t come if she’s there.” I even said I’d love to take her out separately for her birthday.\r\n\r\nJess did not take it well. She pretty much said, “It’s my birthday, and I want everyone there! You’re making this about you. Can’t you just be civil for one night? That drama was forever ago.” She called me “dramatic” and said I was “holding grudges,” like I’m the problem for not wanting to hang with someone who trashed me. Now she’s on this mission to get me to “just get over it.”\r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for prioritizing my own comfort and mental health by not wanting to go to a party where my ex-friend, who totally screwed me over, will be?",

That's how saying \"I won't attend your event if you invite Y\" comes across.\n\nWhat you do, if you absolutely cannot be in the same room as Chloe, is decline the birthday party invitation with no reasons or excuses given. You can even, if you wish, say \"Oh, I'm so sorry, but I won't be able to make your party. I'd love to get together with you at another time, though. What about you and me getting together for a birthday lunch on the Monday Saturday after your birthday at Favourite Restaurant. My treat, of course, it'll be my birthday gift to you.\n\nThat being said, many people do manage to attend parties even though they despise another guest. They simply greet that person with cool courtesy if they can't avoid doing so, don't get into conversation with them, and spend all their time partying with other guests.",

There were a few of us talking and I was excited to share it with them because having my old car put a lot of financial strain on me and this new one was much more affordable. My friends knew that I was under some financial strain so they were happy for me. \n\nOne of my friends quickly started asking about money. In the past he has come off kind of judgemental about finances. He's been in a pretty good situation for a while and I've been struggling to get off the ground. He asked specific questions like, How much did you pay upfront? How much did your dad help you? How much did they give you for your trade in? \n\nI realize that these are pretty normal things to ask but I kept giving non specific answers to the questions, replying with answers like, not much, a lot, a good amount. I just didn't feel like answering the questions in the moment, I felt kinda vulnerable and just wanted to be excited about the car.\n\nAfter I gave another non specific answer he asked me why im dodging his questions and I just said because its not really his business. He said hes my friend not just anyone and I told him I know that but money has been tight for a while and has become a bit of a sore subject. I said I appreciate that hes my friend but I just don't want to talk numbers right now. \n\nAfter that he kinda went quiet and didn't say much to me for the rest of the night. Im worried that I offend him and I was being rude. So am I the ass hole for telling my friend I don't want to talk numbers about my new car?",

      "scenario_description": "Sorry for the long winded context but I think it's needed. I work in a medium sized financial investment company in Australia. When the company was hiring for an analyst position, I spoke to the department head about my cousin Damo, who recently graduated, and confirmed they could apply. I normally sit on the interview panel but agreed to sit it out for Damo.\n\nWith a good amount of coaching, he aced the interview. So far so good!\n\nWe recruit in batches, rotating through different teams, which means we can see where they will be best suited. Again I consulted with the department head and agreed he could join my team, but he made it clear any favouritism would be career ending for me.\n\nThis is where the train leaves the tracks... it was like a light switch. Damo went from coming in the office 4/5 days a week, to working from home. He burned through all his sick leave in a bit over a month. I wanted to talk with my aunt, Kazza, but felt that would have been crossing the boundary.\n\nIt all came to a head when he setup a meeting, no context, pulling our department head into a client meeting. When I called to get details he was MIA for an hour. When he finally responded I asked what happened - his response, just working. I said how did you miss my call and that's when he straight up lies, BSing about IT issues.\n\nThe cherry on top was the meeting invite was a mistake, he added the wrong 'Jake' on the invite.\n\nThere was a boat load of work on my part, documenting performance warnings, getting login reports (pro tip, don't use your work laptop to check sports results) etc. End result was we dismissed Damo without going through warnings or performance management. The fall out has been huge - Kazza went nuclear, claiming I've ruined Damos life because this was his first real job.\n\nAITA? Sure, I could have massaged some of the issues and asked Kazza to intervene. The lack of work ethic and putting my job on the line enraged me, so I can admit that firing him is what I thought he deserved.",
