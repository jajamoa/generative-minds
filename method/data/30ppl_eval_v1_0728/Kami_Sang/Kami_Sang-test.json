      "scenario_description": "I (F30) recently lost my dad. My sisters and I are due to receive some money from my dad's estate. I brought up with my mum that my younger sister (27) recieved a financial gift from my dad last year to help her with the cost of driving lessons and the purchase of a car. I was told at the time that I would get the same amouny towards the cost of a car when i bought one. My mum told me to raise this with my sisters as they had both been given financial help from my dad with buying a car and I hadn't, due to not having started learning. I brought this up with them today and asked that I receive this money from the estate. They said that it's not their fault that my dad passed away before I started to learn how to drive and I dont have any claim to money I was promised. I responded that it was unfair that they had both received the money and that I should be paid this out of his estate. They disagreed and said that I couldn't make claims to be owed this, with my older sister (35) saying that as she learnt to drive when she was 17, it was ridiculous to even bring this up (my sister was given a car and driving lessons as a gift when she turned 17, however, 5 years later when I turned 17, my family was in financial difficulty and couldn't afford to do the same for me and so I didn't learn. I then went off to university, moved abroad, moved back to the UK living in a big city and always used public transport so driving wasn't a priority. As i get older i want to learn for when I have kids - hopefully in the next 5 years)\nThis disagreement led to a huge argument and my older sister storming off and calling me names. This feels quite obvious to me but they're of a very different opinion and its causing rifts in our relationship. AITA?? ",

      "scenario_description": "I'm 14M and live in the Netherlands, so i cycle to school and back. There is this one girl in my class, we don't really talk with each other, but i see her regularly because she lives on my way home. Most of the time i catch up with her, but sometimes i stay behind her, cause i'm tired and don't want to cycle hard.\n\nSo one day after school i get called to an office, when i came in i saw my mentor and that girl sitting. I was really confused ofc, cause i don't know her that well so why was i there? Then my mentor said that that girl didn't feel safe when she was cycling home, because she thought i was stalking her and that she would appreciate if i changed my way home. At first i laughed it off, thinking it was a weird kind of humor, but when they kept looking serious at me i said: 'Wait you're serious? ofc im not stalking her! Why would I? She lives on my way home and if i had to change my route back home i need to cycle way longer!' But my mentor made it very clear that she would take measures if i didn't change my route. Then i got really mad and said/yelled. 'Listen, I don't care what she does or where she lives, i don't stalk her! Why would i stalk her, I don't even have a crush on her. (at this moment i turned to girl) I don't have a crush on you, hell you wouldn't even be in my top 15!' At that moment she began to cry, i didn't know what to do, so i walked away.\n\nNow i get why se may think i was stalking her, and it is a little creepy to get followed by a guy as a girl. And i made her cry when i said that she wasn't even in my top 15. I get that a lot of girls are insecure about their bodies and i may made her insecurity worse. So am I the asshole for making her cry?",

      "scenario_description": "I recently went on a family vacation with my fiancé (27M), my sister (22F), her boyfriend (28M), and the rest of our family. My sister had asked if we wanted to ride with the same car to save gas. we said yes. Her boyfriend (EDIT: who I have spent a handful of family lunches around nothing more) and my fiance did most of the driving. her boyfriend drives aggressively. Speeding, hard braking, passing cars on tight corners. Especially as it was really rainy and stormy on our way there. \nHe even aquaplaned going 140kmh on the highway and joked to our mom. \nToward the end of the trip, they said they wanted to stay an extra day, even though my sister had originally set the plan as Monday to Friday. My fiancé and I said no. We had plans, including meeting with my best friend who’s going through a rough breakup and my fiance meeting his cousin AND and we were facing an 8-hour drive. They seemed annoyed afterward.\nThe next morning, I actually tried to be gracious and said: “If you really want to stay another day, that’s okay with me.” I was trying to offer them a way out because they looked unhappy. her boyfriend snapped, saying I “keep changing my opinion.”\nThen came the drive home. While driving down cliffside serpentine roads, he started handling the car aggressively again. We told him we were scared and asked him to slow down. He actually did, and even apologized later. \nThey had asked us if it’s fine if they don’t drop us off at our home but at the train station next to their apartment. I had originally said okay but then after we had been on traffic for 2 hours with my best friend waiting for me in addition to that, I realized that we would miss our train exactly having to wait 30 minutes for the next train. So we would have 1 hour extra travel time. \nSo I asked if they could drop us at another station, just 10 minutes further for them, but still on their route. That would save us over an hour.\nHer boyfriend immediately snapped again. Same line: “You always change your mind,” and “We didn’t have to pick you up anyway.” For context:\n\n\nMy fiancé drove half the time\n\n\nAnd we’re paying our full share of gas \nAnd we would’ve taken our own car hadn’t they offered. \nThey say that they had to go home to be with their cat sitter friend who was sitting inside the apartment. I on the other hand had my best friend outside my apartment. \nAs the argument escalated, he started driving fast again. This time during the fight.\nDoing it again, while angry, felt deliberate. Like he wanted to intimidate us or take control. \nMy sister kept repeating, “It’s fine, it’s just 10 minutes, just drive them,”  while he kept saying ‚we’ll find a solution.“ so Im guessing he wanted to stall time. \nTo be clear. Im not mad at her. I’m mad at him.\nI tried to call her after the next day. No answer. No message. Nothing. She’s always on her phone. I know she saw it. \nSo… AITA for changing plans like he sees it? \n",

      "scenario_description": "My boyfriend (33 M) and I (25 F) have been together for eight months. \nI’m putting myself through school, and am working towards getting my third degree. Because of this, I’m super broke and penny pinch in every way I can. My boyfriend is settled in his career with disposable income, so we have different habits when it comes to spending money (our finances are completely separate).\nHis birthday was last week, but I didn’t get him a physical gift because all of the things he really wants or needs are wildly outside my budget. Instead, I woke up super early in the morning to make him a big, special breakfast (french toast, eggs, bacon, and coffee), and brought it to him in bed.\nHe’s the type to work even on his birthday, so i also made him a special packed lunch (grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, mozzarella cheese, veggies, the works, and rice on the side). While he was at work, I cleaned his whole house. I swept, dusted, mopped, picked up, and organized. Then I made his favorite dinner (penne vodka) and organized a movie night of his all time favorites. When he got home, I gave him a handwritten happy birthday card before we ate dinner and watched the movies. \nI also planned a surprise party that weekend with his friends and family (which i also cleaned up everything after) and I thought he had a great time, but he admitted to me yesterday that he was upset and felt unimportant because i didn’t het him an actual present. \nI reminded him about my financial situation. He said it wasn’t about the cost of the gift, but the gesture behind giving something, and it could have been something small. I asked him if everything else I did wasn’t enough of a gesture, and he said that wasn’t the point. Now we’re both just upset at each other. \nSo, am I the asshole for not getting my boyfriend a physical birthday present?\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people talking about love languages and communication. I agree! Those are super important. My love language is actually physical touch, not acts of service like a lot of people are guessing. I know his love language is gifts, so i thought a handmade card would be enough along with everything else. I’m just confused and upset because I tried to go above and beyond due to the fact that my budget constraints meant I couldn’t buy him a gift that wasn’t from the dollar store. I liked the comments about craft gifts! I think those are good alternatives, and I’ll talk to my boyfriend about that to see what he thinks! I hope this is just a communication issue. \nA lot of people are also asking about using the money i spent on food for a gift instead. The money i spent on food was part of my grocery budget. It’s money I would’ve spent anyway, i just factored in his favorite things (plus i used a a small bit from his fridge). My budget was, and continues to be, very tight. ",

I would just say that people tend to expect an actual tangible gift from their SO so maybe it was something you could have discussed with him in advance.  However, 3 home cooked special meals, a party and a clean house - that's something I would love.\n\nDon't do that craft shit please.  NTA for putting in a lot of effort.",

      "scenario_description": "So I am 25f and my husband is 29m he does have some health issues making hard to move around and enjoy things in life making him only love inside things. I on the other hand love outdoors and thrive on movement.  2 weeks before my birthday we agreed to do something together the following weekend so we would have all day. The day off I have group therapy where we made cake ( husband not there) and then my landlord took us( husband and I ) out for lunch. Then I went to work. \nWeekend rolls around and he tell me he still doesn't know what we are doing dispite me asking for the past two weeks. I say ok and give suggestions of things I actually want to do; have a picnic in the main park, go swimming, do a twighlight hike ,eat junk movie snacks and do a movie marathon at home. All low budget all easy for the most part.\nDay comes and he makes a big fuss because I slept till about 3 pm as I got off at work at 6:30am that morning. We agree tomorrow. Tomorrow comes ,He is up and is getting upset about how the floors aren't sweepet and mopped so I do that then he says get on your stuff we are going to the sculpture park. I'm not big into sculptures but hey pinic ,so I'm like great should I grab the picnic stuff  he says hell no . Oooook.....we go to the park we walk around taking lots of breaks for him not a big deal and we even took a 45 min break just sitting and talking about odd stuff like he was quite rude to me checking his phone constantly and complaining about everything. We leave early cuz he was hurting only spending 2 hours there not seeing everything and I ask if we could stop and get a 1.50 ice cream from my work place and says hell no and I'm being ungrateful. And I explained I'm sorry I just thought a cool treat would be nice and it's not expensive so it wouldn't hurt the bank. He then goes on to tell me I'm ungrateful for the pain he has went through for this and what not and our landlord took us out so he wouldn't have to and I had cake with my group so he shouldn't have to and I'm acting like I don't like this stuff \nhis words upsets me and admit no I don't I don't get scriptures they make me feel stupid if they are so abstract yes I liked the walking but I'd rather go to the dedicated hiking place with semi paths then just mowed paths he complained about constantly. And it feels like he just googled outside things and picked the first one not even listening to what I had to say.  And that if someone else took me he wouldn't have to in his book.\n\nAnd now I've ruined his day and we will not be doing anything for my birthday next year he promises.......\n\nAnd now I feel like an ahole for not having a good time and saying something and asking for a McDonald's ice cream cone.....\nShould I have told him before I didn't want to or did I ask for to much\n\n\n\nUPDATE:  Thank you so much for all the feedback. With that said to answer some questions;\n\n1) No, he does not work. His Pain makes it hard for him to do things and he doesn't like people. Thus meaning he doesn't get along and work well with others. But I make enough for us to live mostly comfortably with little to no Credit card debt.\n\n2) I am ok now, I made myself some \"nice\" cream. Granted we did get into a spat afterwards about how I'm a spoiled  brat.... Didn't like that but it's ok I can brush it off.\n\n3) It wasn't always this way, honestly looking over the comments one really hit me. No I do not understand his pain but I do try. And I try to be understanding, I hold on because I do love him and I know pain can change people. He refuses a scooter/ chair but does have a nice wooden cane I got him for his birthday.( Yes it was professional sized)\n\n4) Yes, I'm his only caretaker. But we are trying to get someone to help too. As I have severe burnout from working my 40+ hour job, and taking care of the house. As well as my own trauma from my life before and after I meet him. No, not really from him but, he does remind me at times by accident setting me back.\n\n5) yes he does get controlling. However it only started since he started having chronic pain, I fear this comes from the fear of abdomen. I'm trying to convince him to go to therapy.\n\n6) thank you all for the birthday wishes \n\n7) Yes, the McDonald's ice cream works are the McDonald's I work at, I help service it so it's not down as much. The amount of cleaning is crazy. It makes me wonder why I became a shift manager when I deal with the smells between it and the drink stations/ drains.\n\n8) I do cope but it's hard. My favorite times are honestly with his family and work. However we are about to move in 2 months 3 Hours away from all that for a better job and doctors for him. To be honest, my cats help keep me going when things are hard. And those rare moments when we are ok and happy , but since his pain it's better to be mostly quiet and parallel interaction then head on. Today just solidified that",

I want to acknowledge it's a lot to deal with at 25 for the rest of your life but you are married and I personally don't believe you break up because it got tough due to a medical situation.\n\nHe's also young and this must be really demotivating and mentally didficult for him - in addition to the pain. Obviously, he needs the right resources and tools and you both might need couples' therapy to help you navigate.\n\nI'm saying he has to make a greater effort but you also need to exercise compassion and be real.\n\nOP I love the outdoors and I was diagnosed (and I live in the tropics) with reactions to the sun through rosacea and severe polymorphus light eruption.  It is heartbreaking for me but I cannot handle being outdoors now.  If I have to be outdoors I use an umbrella - in the hot sun.  I am very uncomfortable and I do get cranky.\n\nSo you can't expect him to do outdoor activity with you esp for hours.  That's unreasonable.  You need to do the outdoor stuff you like with other friends and do shorter activities with him.",

I had my tiny foldable umbrella in my bag and pulled it out.\n\nThere’s this girl (20F) in my class who constantly mocks me — my clothes, my handwriting, even my water bottle (she once called it “village-core aesthetic”). We’ve never had a decent interaction. She's always loud and surrounded by her group, always has something sarcastic to say about me. I mostly ignore it.\n\nAnyway, today as I was opening my umbrella, she ran up to me and said, “Hey, share kar lete hai, waise bhi jagah hai”\n[Translation: \"Hey, move a bit. There is space.\"]\n\nI just looked at her and said, “Sorry, it's small.” And walked away.\n\nI could literally hear her say “bitch” under her breath. Later, in class, some of her friends said I was “heartless” and “mean” for not sharing in an emergency.\n\nBut I’m sorry — I’m tired of being treated like garbage and then expected to be generous. It’s not like she was stranded in a jungle. It was just rain.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Back story: I’ve (30F) been with my husband (31M) for 10 years and always had a fine relationship with his family. They’re generally nice to me but a bit stand off-ish, I think that’s just their vibe. \n\nSince my husband and I got married 5 years ago, I’ve made an effort to help plan things with his family like I do with mine. Every time it’s one of his parents birthdays, I reach out a week or two before to both of his parents and his siblings to plan a dinner or having them at our house to celebrate. Even for my husband’s grandma’s and grandpa’s birthdays will I do this, plus Mother’s and Father’s Day. \n\nHere is the breaking point:\n\nThis past weekend for Father’s Day, my husband was unavailable in the afternoon and so I reached out to my BIL, SIL, FIL & MIL and let them know that we would be able to something at night or in the morning before or after my husbands appointment. They all said to just let them know. I was busy that week and told my husband it was his responsibility to figure out what we were doing for Father’s Day with his family. Sunday came along and my husband called his dad in the morning and asked what he was up to and he said that my BIL and SIL were at the house having breakfast with him. They had not reached out to my husband and I, not even a text to invite us as well. \n\nAnd this isn’t the first time, in November, for my FILs birthday, my MIL reached out the day before and mentioned that they have had plans for weeks to go to lunch with my BIL & SIL and since we asked about their plans we could just come with them. \n\n\nAt this point, I am feeling petty and told my husband that I’m no longer planning ANY events for his family. If they are going to do stuff and not invite us then I’m not going to stretch myself thin to put in effort for these people. Especially when my SIL gets a gushing FB post every year for her birthday and I don’t even get a text for mine. \n\nMy brother told me he agrees with me but that it is kind of an asshole move- do we agree with this? \n\n",

They asked you to let them know and you didn't.\n\nBIL/SIL probably arranged with them to have breakfast or just went on the spur of the moment.  Where's the rule that you had to be included?  You surely can't be mad at FIL (it's his Father's Day) or even MIL.\n\nOP ot's ok for people to celebrate things separately.  Not everything has to be a group celebration.  Why can't BIL/SIL take Dad out for his birthday without you and your husband?\n\nYou and your spouse can also celebrate Dad on your own.\n\nNot even your husband cared - he waited toll Father's Day to ask his own Dad what he was up tp.  Their whole famiky - including your husband - behaves like this.\n\nYTA - if this means your husband and you won't celebrate his family's moments - you just don't need to do it with the whole clan.\n\nNot everything has to include everyone!  Also, why isn't your husband more proactive with his own family.  Your husband behaved  like his Dad had to make his own Father's Day plan and invite you and your husband.",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (31F) is staying with me temporarily after leaving her husband. I (30M) have a small apartment but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she’s six months pregnant. I wasn't very pleased about this situation but she is my sis afterall.\n\nThe main issue has been food. I’m pretty disciplined about what I eat because I am in bulk stage and hitting the gym regularly. I portion things, label them and plan for the entire week. But every other day something’s gone. Makes me crazy.\n\nShe’ll drink all my expensive shakes, polish off meals I’ve prepped for work, eat snacks I’ve saved for post run, and even finish leftovers I was planning to turn into new meals. When I bring it up, she shrugs and says things like “Cravings hit hard” or “Hormones” or \"You are being mean\".\n\nI asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. Or hell, manage her own food for god's sake. She refuses to do anything about it.\n\nSo last week I ordered a small mini fridge and set it up in my bedroom. It’s just big enough for my meal prep, snacks and drinks. I didn’t make a scene about it. I just quietly started putting all my stuff there.\n\nShe noticed two days later and got pissed. She said I was being “childish,” “dramatic” and “treating her like a thief.” I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights.\n\nNow she’s sulking and has told our parents after her failed marriage, her brother is also alienating her. And she is just a burden for everyone. My mom called and said I should “pregnancy isn’t easy” and especially for her situation.\n\nI don’t think I’m being cruel. I’m still letting her live here rent-free, and I’ve even offered to order food or cook together, but I just want my food to be left alone. A part of me understands she is going through trouble. But, at my expense?\n\nAITA?",

She’s in the process of a divorce where i hope my father gets custody over me. \n\nJust yesterday we got dropped off with her for the week since custody was different for the summer. Today i thought we would finally have a peaceful morning; until she started asking questions. It started off slow with just stuff about what im going to do in the future, what i wanted to study etc. However it quickly turned into her softly pressuring me to get a job, which yes i do want to get but really can’t since with how custody is at the moment piled up with my afterschool activities. She then pried with that topic until i got overwhelmed and left unprompted. \n\nI was in the bathroom trying not to stress about it until i heard her talking to my grandma about how i was wasting my potential of being bilingual by going for a “useless, low sought after degree” and should go into a medical or law field (i’ve told her before that i would much rather not get into medicine before.) since coding wouldn’t get me anywhere especially if it was for “silly little video games”; which was what i was currently looking into as an excuse since i didn’t know what i wanted to get into coding specifically. \n\nI don’t even know what i want anymore. It just feels like she just wants something to show off to relatives. \n\nedit; no i wasn’t crying at the mention of a job, as stated i do want to get one but its impossible with how custody is and my lack of driving skills; i was crying at the fact that my mother was asking me a lot of questions while also downplaying my CURRENT college interests.",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 17m, and I’ve been close friends with a girl, \"Alexa\" (16f), since 2nd grade. We were practically inseparable—texting daily, talking constantly, bonding over shared interests like music and Bluey. I developed feelings for her, but never acted on them. Then last year, our mutual friend “Chandler” asked her to prom with a rap song he made. It was just as friends, but it dissapointed me—I had waited too long.\n\nThis year, I danced with Alexa at Homecoming to Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud,” I decided to write my own Ed Sheeran-style love song to ask her to prom. I incorporated lyrics from tons of 2010s hits (a concept I’d always wanted to try) and made a Bluey-inspired digital sign for the promposal based on the yes-no button from the show. I shared the song with friends in February; they loved it, and Alexa asked to hear it. She said it was amazing. In a small group of close friends, I told her I wrote it for her, showed the sign, and asked her to prom—as friends.\n\nHer response was immediately off. She said “Well, I don’t know. I’ll have to see.” My best friend “Benny” was upset she didn’t give a clear yes or no, but I told him to leave it alone—I didn’t want her to feel pressured. Later that day, I learned from Benny that Alexa said she might not even go to prom. The next day, she sent me a long, cold message rejecting me. She said she wouldn’t go with me even as friends and explained she felt forced to go with Chandler the year before and didn’t want to be forced again. For context: I never used her name in the song, and I explicitly asked as a friend. I did post it on social media, but with her permission.\n\nThat Monday, she brought up prom at our table and discussed who she could go with—pointedly, right in front of me. She made a comment that “being nice isn’t enough anymore.” I muttered, “Ain’t that the truth,” which triggered her to explode—in the middle of Spanish class—saying she had been too nice to me for too long and now had to act mean. At the time, I thought she was upset because she assumed I was mad she said no. I wasn’t mad—just hurt by her delivery. I told her I wasn’t upset and thought we moved on. She did go to Prom, but by herself. I thought we were good. But I was wrong\n\nBut in May, I realized something strange: she hadn’t responded to any of my messages since the rejection—something completely out of character. When I brought it up to Benny and another mutual friend, the friend told me Alexa had blocked me. I was stunned. The mutual friend said Alexa explained it by saying she had \"been nice too long.\"\n\nWhen she came back to school, I privately confronted her and said I knew she blocked me. Her only response: “Yeah.” No emotion. Then she immediately wanted to know who told me. I didn’t answer, to protect her friendship with the girl.\n\nNow I’m left confused and hurt. What did I do wrong? All I did was eask her to prom as friends. We’d been close for years—how could that lead to me suddenly getting blocked?",

      "scenario_description": " \nI (late 20s, F) went wedding dress shopping without my mom, and now she says she’s extremely hurt and can’t even look at the photos. I didn’t mean to exclude her, but I’m feeling torn about whether I handled this wrong.\n\nSome background: My mom and I haven’t been emotionally close lately. A few months ago, I told her I felt sad she hadn’t been more involved in planning. My wedding is next fall, but it’s in a city where October is peak wedding season — I’ve already started booking vendors due to limited availability.\n\nWhen I brought this up, she got defensive and told me my wedding was “too far away” to care about and that she had too much going on in her life. That really hurt, and I stopped expecting her to be involved in the near term.\n\nA few months later, I planned a dress shopping trip in my home state during a holiday weekend I was already visiting. I invited my sisters and grandma (who I’m very close to), and we had a great time. I gave my mom about a month’s notice and invited her, knowing her schedule as a flight attendant is rigid and she often needs months to plan time off. She also doesn’t live in my home state. She didn’t ask for alternatives, didn’t seem interested, and didn’t try to make it work — so I assumed she wouldn’t be joining.\n\nI found a dress I love and sent her photos, telling her we missed her. Her reply was cold. When I followed up, she said she was deeply hurt and that having my grandma there was “salt in the wound.” She also said I should’ve prioritized her above everyone else and even suggested I should’ve traveled to her instead.\n\nTo be honest, I did deprioritize her involvement after she said she wasn’t available — emotionally or logistically. I planned around people who had been present and supportive. I also wanted my grandma there — she’s older, and there’s a real chance she may not be around by the wedding, so I wanted to share that moment with her now.\n\nEven after the fact, I told my mom I’d love to have her come with me for accessory shopping or to a final fitting, but she hasn’t responded to that and says the damage is done.\n\nI feel awful she’s hurt, but I also don’t think I acted maliciously. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Mom said my wedding (next fall) was too far away to care about and didn’t try to join my dress shopping trip. I went with family who was available and supportive. Now she’s hurt and says I excluded her. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi. I'm an early 20s bartender currently moving out of my family home. This month has been extra long shifts, training new staff, and moving everything I own. I work late evenings and nights, usually 7 hours but some shifts lately have been 10. I have a genetic disorder called Fabry's disease that makes falling+staying asleep harder, you lose energy quicker, and your body needs more recovery time. All this to say when I woke up this morning at 11 (I'd planned to sleep till 12:30) to my mom and her fiance's loud talking and slamming doors and cabinets, I didn't feel too good. I waited for half an hour hoping it would die down, no such luck.\n\nI walked out into the kitchen, bleary-eyed, irritable, full body soreness, and I pleaded my case for hushed voices for 1 more hour. My soon-to-be stepdad said \"welcome to adulthood\", an unhelpful comment in any scenario, and my mom pulled me aside to say they had decided on an impromptu BBQ (something that surprised me since that's never occurred before in my 20+ years of living), and to get over it. She brushed me off, and I felt pretty shitty about the whole interaction. Here's where it starts to get dicey and I do something I'm not proud of. I slam my own door shut, to show how loud and unpleasant it is. \n\nNow my mom starts texting me. She says no one I live with is ever gonna care if I'm sleeping, and that I'm selfish. Yesterday I had confided in her that I'm struggling greatly with loneliness because everyone around me is partnered and my last partner was abusive. She says \"you're selfish, you only care about you, this is why you're alone and no one loves you.\" She said no one can stand to be around me and no decent person would tolerate my \"poor me\" attitude. She said \"good luck finding someone, princess.\" It was devastating to read. It was the most vulnerable spot she could've hit me in. I blocked her after that and then unblocked her 10 minutes later when I felt guilty. We haven't talked more than that. \n\nI've talked to a few friends today about what happened, they say she's not right about me and I've not been selfish with them but I don't know. I'm too shaken and I haven't been able to stop crying more than a few minutes. I feel way too raw to think clearly, I really think what she said was way too intense for that situation but she could have a point about me, she could see something my friends don't. I don't know how I'll face her cuz I'll definitely start to cry and she could take that as confirmation that I'm a spoiled brat. I don't know what to do anymore man. ",

I was hoping he would just give us the money like he always said so we could use it how we want. I get that maybe it feels different for him if he is not directly paying for stuff, but it kind of feels like we only get the full amount if we do things his way…. !? \n\nAm I being a spoiled brat for not wanting to follow the exact same plan my sister did?",

      "scenario_description": "I live in a state that gets cold winters and hot, humid summers. I have never been lucky enough to live somewhere with central AC and my current house is no different. It gets very very hot. The only rooms with air conditioning are the bedrooms, one is for sleeping and the other is an office. We have lived here for 4 years now. \n\nEvery summer I have the same problem, it gets too hot for me to cook. Right now, my kitchen is 85°f (~29.5c) In the past summers, it gets up to 90°f (32c). It is so hot that when I cook, even quick meals like spaghetti, I overheat. I get dizzy, my head hurts, I feel weak. It is awful. My husband knows about this. \n\nI finally got fed up. After another episode of overheating while cooking, I broke down and ordered an air conditioner for the kitchen. It’s small and cheap, about $200 and it will keep the kitchen cool. My plan is to use it when I am cooking or cleaning in the kitchen. \n\nMy husband wasn’t home when I ordered it and I honestly forgot to tell him I ordered it until it arrived 2 days later. He saw me bring it inside and asked what it was and I told him it was an air conditioner for the kitchen. \n\nHe is mad that I didn’t consult him before buying it. That is true, I didn’t. And I forgot to tell him I did. He told me it was a waste of money, too expensive to run, and I can just use a fan when I cook or just not cook at all. He wanted me to return it. \n\nI don’t want to go the whole summer never being able to cook because the kitchen won’t cool off. I also paid for it with my own money, I don’t expect him to split the cost with me, and I pay the electric bill! I can afford the added cost of running it a few times per week to cool down the kitchen so I can cook without getting sick. \n\nI didn’t return it like he wanted and I installed the air conditioner myself and have used it twice since I got it, once to cook and once to do a deep clean in the kitchen. When it’s been on, he scoffs and rolls his eyes and acts all passive aggressive because he thinks it was a waste of money and frivolous spending. \n\nSo AITA for buying an air conditioner without consulting my husband?",

      "scenario_description": "\nTitle:\nAITA for asking for a car back that I gave to my sister for free after she fixed it\n\nA while ago, I ( Phoebe, 25F) told my sister (Ursula  35F) she could have my car. It was a verbal agreement—I never signed over the title. Later, my lawyer told me I couldn’t just give it away like that since the car was still legally in my name and I’m currently going through a divorce with my ex husband (Joey 25M) . If anything happened, I would be responsible. So I reached out to try and fix things the right way.\n\nI offered to:\n\t•\tReimburse her for any parts or labor she’d paid for\n\t•\tGive her rides while she looked for a replacement, using the money I was offering\n\nI was trying to be fair. Instead, she told me: “Take me to court.”\nShe also allegedly told her ex, who’s a mechanic (Ross 36M) , to strip the car for parts. That was the breaking point for me.\n\nImportant detail: at this point, she couldn’t even legally drive the car because her license is suspended. So I was the one still liable for a car she legally couldn’t use.\n\nI was overwhelmed, upset, and in a bad financial spot. I was literally on my way to a pawn shop to sell my valuables just to pay for the car. On the way, I decided to stop at my Nanna’s house, hoping she’d hear me out. But instead, it felt like she had already taken Ursula’s side.\n\nShe told me to just let it go because “ Ursula needs it more—she’s going through a divorce and you have your boyfriend to help you.” Then she threw in the classic guilt trip: “Blood is thicker than water.” No one helped me during my divorce tho 🥴 not financially or emotionally, I was told “your doing such a great job you don’t need us”\n\nEventually, Ursula blocked me, and Nanna told her to unblock me. When she did, she told me she was “just treating me like a regular person” and that “this was just a bad business deal.”\nAt that point, I told her to keep it that way—and keep the car.\n\nThen I found out Ursula had lied to her ex Ross about the situation, and that’s why he threatened to strip the car—because he thought I was trying to screw her over. Her ex had called me saying that he was willing to help me with the car or get another one because no one else in my family would. He was the only person in my family with compassion this entire time. \nSo, AITA? \n\nUpdate: a day later \nIn the end, her ex gave the car back to me—but on a payment plan for the parts he put into it.\nThat was all I wanted from the start: to pay for the parts and keep things fair. On a payment plan we both agreed to and made up documents to hold both our end of the agreement for payment. Now, because of the lies Ursula told her ex, she won’t be getting the money from the car like she expected.\nAlso, I won’t be giving her rides anymore, which is the part I feel like the AH about. \n\nHopefully last update: two days later \nI took the car to get checked with a code scanner and drove it on the highway to make sure everything is fine and for the most part it is. When the car got to my house it was at night and I was frazzled and tired so I didn’t take that much of a look and in the morning I saw that the plastic for the brake drivers lights were broken as well as there being a huge dent next to it, and had some fresh mud marks of someone’s dirty shoes. There’s also the front headlight on the passenger side was just completely torn off.You wouldn’t have noticed unless you were looking for it. I’m not going to push the issue though. She was mad, I get it. Slapped some duct tape on it since the bulbs were working and will fix when I have time…and the money. I also forgot to mention that Ross said he was going to sell me another car and then showed up with my car lol…I wasn’t going to say no a third time.\n\n⸻\n\nUpdate – 3 Weeks Later:\nI know I said I hoped there wouldn’t be another update, but yesterday the cops had to be called because of Ross. I wanted to wait until I’d fully calmed down before writing this, because I wasn’t in the right headspace at the time.\n\nWhen Ross first gave me the car, he only gave me one key and said the other one was still at his house. (Yeah, I know—accepting that was dumb.) For a few weeks, I’d been asking him if he could either bring the other key or let me come get it, and he kept saying he was too busy with work. I tried to be understanding.\n\nThen he called and asked when I was going to finish paying him for the parts—just $200 left. I told him I had it right then and could give it to him if he brought me the other key. So I went to his house, and he handed me a different key, saying he had that one made because he “lost” the original. I didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t even the right key—my boyfriend had the original one Ross gave me.\n\nI called Ross to let him know, and he said, “Oh, my bad—I gave you the wrong one. I found it.” Like… seriously? So we met nearby (because my boyfriend was understandably pissed), and Ross gave me the correct key and both fobs.\n\nThen he starts telling me that my own family was saying I wasn’t going to pay him and spreading rumors that I cheated on my ex, Joey. I told him straight up: “Yeah, I cheated. I don’t lie. He abused me, and he deserved it. And I just paid you the rest, so what’s the issue?”\n\nRoss laughed and said, “If you ever find another reason to cheat, hit me up.”\nI told him, “Um… me and my boyfriend’s anniversary is next week, and I’m happy. No thanks.”\n\nOf course I went home and told my boyfriend. I begged him not to text Ross, but he did anyway—and sure enough, Ross showed up at our house. So we called the cops. He told them he wanted the car parts back and asked for the keys so he could take the car. The cop told him no and that he’d have to settle that in court.\n\nRoss ended up just taking the leftover parts he had left in the trunk. Then he tried to say he wanted the $600 battery and the headlights too. I told him no on the battery, but fine—take the headlights. Only because he said if I let him take those, we’d be done and he wouldn’t try to get any more money from me. In the end\nHe only took the headlights out and then asked if he could buy me new headlights, I obviously said f**k no. He’s now officially trespassed from my house.\n\nAbout an hour later, he called me again—said he’d gotten in a wreck on his way home and asked if I could come help him because he was drunk. I told him no, that my boyfriend would never allow that. Then I finally blocked him. The only reason I hadn’t earlier was because I’d been too upset, curled up in bed, and just didn’t think to do it.\n",

I think she could have had a really great case in court.\n\nYou getting divorced doesn't negate that you gave her the car.  All you had to do was complete a step - transfer title.\n\nSeems like you wanted some money out of an asset that you gave away and just needed to take a final step on.\n\nIn addition, you're only focused on you - they paid money upfront to fix the car on the basis you gave it to her.  Yet, now you want a payment plan to give them back their investment.  They're not an effin bank.\n\nYou chose to take your lawyer's advice about a legal technicality that could easily have been fixed to ask for the return of a way more valuable asset than you initially gave and you do not want to pay upfront for it.  You made your divorce $ issues their issue.\n\nYou want to not be an ass? Pay them all their investment now.  Imagine you think it's ok that they should be in a loss position until you can make it up - when they made their investment to fix the car based on you allowing them to have the car.",
