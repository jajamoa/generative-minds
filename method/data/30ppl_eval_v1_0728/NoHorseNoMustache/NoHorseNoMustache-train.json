      "scenario_description": "I 19(F) have been going to the gym for a few months now and Ive noticed this guy probably in his 30s and he always is nice and friendly to everyone- I say Hi and goodbye when he says it to me- The problem is in the middle of my sets or when im doing cardio he‚Äôll stop me or other people and just.. Talk. About anything most of the time its like bragging about being a trainer or about how much he can do the stairs or how much he can lift. And its obnoxious as hell. I try to ignore him or just laugh and put my headphones back on but he is like annoyingly persistent. I get asking how many sets someone has left or how long they‚Äôre gunna be on something, but like why does he keep talking. Ive said stuff like ‚ÄúSorry Im trying to focus‚Äù. but im on the verge of crashing out. He literally was doing it while im on the stairs as im writing this. I dunno what to do without just telling him to leave me alone but that feels like dickhead behavior because everyone else is nice to him.\n\nEdit: When I say crashing out i mean snapping at him. also thank you for the advice\n\nEdit 2 : Ive told him i dont like being spoken to when working out and he still does it. I put on my headphones AND HES STILL TALKING üòî",

I did not say this exactly, though, and just responded with 'Please have him message me the soonest.'\n\nA week has passed and he has not reached out.\n\nMy aunt messages me again and says I should ping her son and tell him I am offering him a job. This is where I got a bit peeved because 1.) They are asking me for a favour, why should I be the one to reach out? And 2.) I never said I am offering him a job.\n\nI said I am not offering him a job, but an interview, and she completely lost it. She said her son has been jobless for a year and in this economy, I should help them out. 'That is what family is for!', she says. She also then called me names and told me I am 'such a bull's shit' because I promised her a job for her son and he has stopped applying since then.\n\nShe's been flooding me with horrible messages since and at this point I have no plans on giving my cousin a chance at all.\n\nAITA? Was my response really easy to misunderstand?\n\nEDIT: I'm not sure if Reddit has a bug but the comments aren't loading! I appreciate everyone's feedback and advice!",

I need some personal space to calm myself down. And all I do to calm myself is just staying home and play games. When I do, I sometimes don't look at my phone and won't reply to anyone, including her.\n\nSure communication might be the problem coming from me, I should just tell her I wanna play games and won't touch my phone. But I've already told her over and over she can just check my discord/steam if I'm playing or not. I literally only have 1 day off from a 45hour work/week.\n\nI also understand where she's coming from. Before we met she got cheated on her previous relationship. She said that was her first time dealing that kind of heartbreak. I've been there too. But I don't like it when she brings her trauma to this relationship. We talked about this and she asked \"so I was the problem?\". We got into a heated argument and in the end I gave in and moving on.\n\nAITA? Or I'm too indulging on my own rights as a partner?",

      "scenario_description": "My son is 8 years old, possibly autistic (still going through assessment), and demand avoidant. We have had issues with his behavior for a long time, and he has often gotten away with his behavior because we (my wife and I), are kinda struggling with whether some of the things he does is him being a kid mis-behaving, or whether it is something he can't help.\n\nAnyway, today he had spent the day playing out with friends.\n\nIt got to dinner time, so I went out to call him in. At which point he refused to come in, told me he didn't have to do as I said, and that I couldn't make him. I asked his friends if they would head home, as it was his dinner time and he had to come in. \n\nInstead he and his friends rode off on their bikes, \"I'll do what I want\". \n\nI followed them as they hadnt gone far down the street. Again I told him he needed to come for his dinner, and if he didn't he wouldn't be allowed out again after dinner, and that I would take his bike (one of his prized possessions) away. His response was \"fuck off you idiot\". \n\nSo I took his bike.\n\nThis is the point my wife got home, and I am in the shit. Apparently taking the bike was an unbelievably cruel thing to do, wasn't a natural consequence, etc, and I had only made things worse.\n\nApparently I was supposed to sit and reason with him out in the street along with his friends, or just let him stay out. \n\nAutism or not, I don't think it is unreasonable to expect him to come in for dinner when asked. I also don't think taking away his bike is unreasonable either. \n\nBut maybe I'm just an asshole? ",

      "scenario_description": "Made a whole account for the first time because my friend said this would make for a good story here. I (19M) have been dating my girlfriend (18F) for about a year. A couple weeks ago, I got pulled over while driving home from her place, and just my luck, the officer who pulled me over was her dad. Although very awkward, he kept it purely professional, said i was speeding, and gave me a ticket. Now, if I was speeding this would have been perfectly fine, but the problem is, I wasn't. I have a dashcam that logs GPS and speed data, and I checked it as soon as I got home. It clearly shows I was going under the speed limit the entire time. \n\nI told my girlfriend I‚Äôm planning to fight the ticket in court. She‚Äôs really upset and says it‚Äôs going to cause a lot of tension with her family. She thinks I should just pay the fine and move on, even if I wasn‚Äôt speeding. From my point of view, this isn't about her dad personally, its purely about not wanting any marks against my license. She feels that by taking it to court, I‚Äôm basically accusing her dad of either lying or making a serious mistake, and that could put him in a really difficult position professionally and personally. She‚Äôs worried this is going to cause a rift not just between me and her dad, but possibly between her dad and her as well for being associated with me. I get where she‚Äôs coming from, and I don‚Äôt want to disrespect her dad or damage the relationship I‚Äôve built with him. Honestly, we‚Äôve always gotten along well, he‚Äôs a tough guy, but I respect him a lot, and I know he‚Äôs just doing his job. \n\nI‚Äôve never had a ticket before, and I pay for my own car and insurance, so something like this could raise my rates and stick with me, especially being so young. I‚Äôm not trying to be difficult, dramatic, or disrespectful, but I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to let something slide that could impact me long-term, especially when I have clear evidence that I wasn‚Äôt speeding. I‚Äôm still planning on fighting the ticket. I have the dashcam footage, I know I wasn‚Äôt speeding. But my girlfriend is incredibly upset. She‚Äôs been distant ever since I told her, and lately she‚Äôs barely talking to me. I can tell she‚Äôs really hurt and stressed about the whole thing. She keeps saying I‚Äôm choosing a stupid traffic ticket over her and her family which is technically true, but that ticket comes with a lot more than just a one time fine. I don't want to take the blame for something I didn't do so I've already plead not guilty and have the court hearing scheduled for a few weeks out. I think this is the right move by putting my future first. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for almost 2 years. We moved in together about 6 months ago. Before we moved in, we had separate places and generally split things when we went out (dinners, trips, etc.), which felt fair.\n\nBut now that we live together, I‚Äôve started to notice how unbalanced things feel.\n\nWe split rent and bills 50/50, which on paper sounds fair. But I make significantly less than him, like, he‚Äôs in tech making nearly 3x what I make. I work in education. So 50% of my income is going toward rent, and for him it‚Äôs maybe like 15% or something... I‚Äôve had to cut back on a lot (no more gym membership, barely going out), and meanwhile he just bought a PS5 and went on a weekend trip with his friends ?? üò≠\n\nI also end up doing more of the cooking, cleaning, groceries, laundry , not because he demands it, but because he just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt really do it unless I ask. I brought this up recently and he said I‚Äôm being unfair and trying to ‚Äúchange the rules‚Äù we agreed on when we moved in.\n\nHe says it‚Äôs not his fault I chose a lower-paying career, and that if we start doing things based on income, then ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next, keeping score on everything?‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm not saying he needs to pay all the rent or anything. I just think 50/50 isn‚Äôt always fair when one person makes so much more. My friends are kind of split, some agree with me, some say I knew what I was getting into and it‚Äôs not fair to expect him to pay more now. The only thing I‚Äôm asking is for my bf to realise and be considerate of the fact that half of my money is being spent on our rent, and try to find some sort of compromise or smth about this :/\n\nSo, AITA for wanting to stop splitting 50/50?\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend and I split rent and bills 50/50, but he makes almost 3x what I do. I‚Äôm struggling while he‚Äôs super comfortable, and I also do more housework. I asked if we could reconsider the split, and he called me unfair. AITA for wanting to change it?\n\nEdited for more info ; Since the comments are too flooded - yes my last place cost way less to live in than our current one. He mainly made the decision for it assuring me that it will all be fine, comforted me because i felt insecure of my lower income job, and told me it‚Äôd be easy and equal for both of us. That is why i agreed to living here with him. He was always nothing but fair to me but ever since we started living together it has been the opposite",

      "scenario_description": "It was my sister‚Äôs (F21) birthday, and our dad and I (F16) went out for about 30 minutes to get her her free birthday drink and buy her a cake. Earlier, my dad asked if she wanted a cake, and she quietly said no. We assumed that if she REALLY didn‚Äôt want one, she would‚Äôve been louder about it, like she usually is when she doesn't want something. So we got her a cake anyway, thinking she might secretly be happy about it.  \nWhen we got back, I cheekily told her, ‚ÄúDad and I thought you secretly wanted a cake, so we got you one because you said it quietly, hehe.‚Äù She immediately responded, ‚ÄúI really didn‚Äôt want one. Did you want me to yell ‚ÄòI DON‚ÄôT WANT A CAKE‚Äô or something?‚Äù I was a little taken aback because I felt like she wasn‚Äôt appreciating the gesture. Honestly, I somewhat suspected this kind of response from her, and maybe I should have known she's not a very expressive type of person.  \nI told her she didn‚Äôt seem thankful. Not because I deeply felt hurt, but because I feel like I needed to call her out on this response, especially on behalf of my dad. He had gone out of his way to do something nice for her, even though he was really busy and did not even have time to eat before his next meeting. Like she could have came along too, but she didn't (to be fair, she and my dad work from home and have 30 min lunch break only). My sister started saying I was painting her as the villain and that I only did this to prove a point. She argued that no matter what she said, she couldn‚Äôt have \"won\" and that I was expecting two things from her (I still don't know what this means).\n\nTo be fair, she also used her birthday reward to buy me a drink from another place, which I was genuinely happy about and thanked her for at the time. Now thinking of it, was this her way of showing her appreciation? And to be completely honest, I wasn‚Äôt super upset for myself, I just felt like my dad‚Äôs effort wasn‚Äôt being appreciated, and she ALWAYS acts like this. I also told her she kept defending herself and never acknowledged our feelings at all. She started crying and said she genuinely did appreciate what we did and that I didn't know her at all.\n\nNow I feel like a total asshole because it was her birthday, and I ended up making her cry. I'm genuinely trying to write this as honestly as possible because I think I was out of line to call her out on her birthday of ALL times but I was a little pissed and my intentions weren't purposefully to make her feel bad. I want to know how to apologize, or at least make things better, because she is going to feel bad for the whole day, especially when we eat the cake.\n\n  \nupdate: I apologized and we had a nice talk about it and i told her about the post I made here and we read through all the comments together and laughed lol. thanks for ur responses/opnion",

My parents worked extremely hard to build a life here for me and my younger siblings, for which I am very grateful. All this time, we have been living in a rental apartment in the outskirts of a big city. However, this year my family were finally able to save enough money to buy a house. They bought a big house in a suburb about 2.5 hours away from the city. I'm really happy for them, this has been their dream. Especially now, since last year they brought my grandparents (all 4 of them!!) to Canada through family sponsorship, and now they have enough space in the house for everyone. \n\nI am also due to start university in September, which I am so excited about. The university is in the city where my parents used to live. Because they spent a lot of time talking about this house purchase and I knew it was coming, I spent the last 2 years working at a fast food job and putting every penny I can aside, so I've saved enough to cover my fees for my on-campus residence (the tuition is covered by government loans). I told my parents that I will live on campus during university because the location of the new house is just too far, its too much, and all hell broke loose. They have called me selfish for wanting to leave the family, because in our culture it is expected that family is all under one roof and that I wouldn't leave until I'm married. Mom keeps crying all the time and talking about how she's going to need help around the house next year, with the grandparents and my younger siblings. Dad keeps saying how he's sad he worked so hard to buy a house for the whole family to live in, and I'm ungrateful for wanting to leave. I keep trying to explain that I just can't fathom spending 5 hours a day - collectively - commuting to and from campus but they won't hear it, they both keep saying that that's what they did during university and they were \"fine\". Now my grandparents have also joined in and keep telling me I'm selfish for wanting to abandon them now that they have moved to Canada. My parents said that they bought the big house with the expectation that I will live in it, planned out my room and everything, but I have been telling them for the past two years why I am working part time and what I am saving up for, I think they just refused to hear it or believe it until now that I've signed my papers for my residence. I even promised to visit every weekend and that's still not enough. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't imagine spending my university years on the trains and buses. The program I'm taking is also famously really academically intense, and I will need a lot of time to study, and I don't understand how I'm supposed to find time to study with that kind of commute. But I feel horrible for making my family feel like this. \n\nAITA? ",

Instead, they added things I think are just wild and outrageous. Like there are dares now for giving head in a car, hooking up in public, getting fingered at a party, sending nudes, filming a sex tape, even having a threesome, getting multiple hickeys from different people in one night. I‚Äôm the chill, more reserved one in the group. I don‚Äôt hook up much, I‚Äôm not judgmental. Everyone but me is taking this challenge so seriously. I made a comment the other day and said they‚Äôre gonna catch something or get caught up because these challenges are getting¬†trashy. I didn‚Äôt say¬†they¬†were trashy, just that the dares themselves were.¬†Now everyone‚Äôs acting like I‚Äôm slut shaming or trying to ruin the vibe. Even went as far as to say I'm jealous because I don't have any points yet. I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable with where it‚Äôs gone, and I think I should be allowed to say that without being seen as judgmental.",

      "scenario_description": "Hi!\n\nIt's my first post here so please do let me know if there's anything wrong and I'll be happy to amend. :)\n\nDisclaimer: there was NO medical concern at any time, it was all edible and fine.\n\nI am 25 yo (F) and own a lil house where I live with my 1 yo medium-big dog. \n\nBackstory: My kitchen is structured in a way that there is an area dedicated to my dog's things: dog food storage, bowls, food toppers, kefirs, spoons for him, wet food, supplements, dedicated sponges to clean his bowls, basically everything that has to do with his nutrition. Among these things, I have a shelf that contains food toppers, which I sometimes add to his food to make it more palatable. These are different flavoured: sirloin, mussel, other kinds of fish, lamb, chicken... and they are in powder form and contain a little wooden spoon inside each jar. They are labelled and in the label it says what it is and what it is intended for, but there's no dog on the label that would make it super obvious at first glance that it's a dog item. That's just how the brand labels products.\n\nOn to the gist: My aunt (60 F) came to visit today as she needed me to do a few things for her (new phone, so she needed help setting it up). When she arrived, I saw I needed something long-ish to be able to open the compartment that would let me add the SIM card in. I told her to wait and I went to look for one. Apparently she felt thirsty so went to the kitchen for water and to snoop a bit, it seems. Harmless, haha. Well when I came back I saw she was in the kitchen holding one of my dog's jars. I didn't think much of it, thought she was reading it because she has a dog too and she might be interested. Next thing I hear is her asking what do I use that powder for, and that it tastes quite nice. I immediately gasped and let her know I use that for my dog, it's dog \"food\". \n\nShe freaked out, understandably. I assured her that while it's used for dogs, it's completely  fine and safe for humans and that nothing's going to happen to her at all. I apologised for the fact she had eaten that in my house, and she started blaming me for leaving the food toppers \"there\" (in a rack over my dog's food corner, over his bowls). I told her that wasn't fair and that while she's welcome to anything in my house and can eat whatever she wants, she should've asked about it given where it was and what it was surrounded with. \n\nShe has now gone to my mom, other aunts, cousins and everyone who will listen to tell them how I \"let her\" eat a spoonful of dog powder/food/thing. I've gotten mix responses, from \"haha, poor aunt\", to full on laughing, to \"oh no that's awful you're an AH\". \n\nWhat do you think, reddit? Should I start storing the toppers behind close cabinets (although she opens cabinets whenever she wants too...), label them with DOG FOOD just in case, or just move on and think about it as a funny lil incident? I don't think i'm an AH per se but at the end of the day she did eat dog food on my watch, so, IDK.\n\nThanks!",

During the entire conversation, she is scrolling on her computer, looking at designs to cut out and make a T-shirt with her cricket. I found this to be extremely rude, as well as she was distracted and not paying attention. This was evidenced during the conversation when she asked about my wife being gone Saturday, when we had spent 5 minutes working out the plans and how to make the first entire weekend work less than 10 minutes prior.\n\nHer contention is that she was listening, and was responding while scrolling. And that she is always scrolling, because of past trauma.\n\nSo, AITA? Or is my roommate right that she can scroll while having important conversations?",

I respect that, but she‚Äôs started assuming it‚Äôs okay to bring the dog to my place.\n\nA few days ago, we planned a movie night at mine. I reminded her to leave the dog at home, and she got annoyed, saying that if I were a real friend, I‚Äôd understand that her dog is basically her ‚Äútherapy.‚Äù I told her I understand she‚Äôs struggling, but I could literally be evicted if my landlord finds out. She said that was ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù and that ‚Äúno one would know.‚Äù\n\nI ended up canceling the movie night, and she hasn‚Äôt responded to my messages since. Mutual friends are split ‚Äî some say it‚Äôs my apartment, my rules.

I'm the only person in the group without kids. Everyone else is busy raising toddlers and infants!\n\nWhile it seems fair that they've been putting on more and more \"adults only\" events - fancy dinners, wine tastings, and events - great right? Um... no. The adults only events are literally during times that I'm working my restaurant shifts (evenings/weekends) because those are the times their babysitters are available.\n\nI've expressed multiple times that it would be great to have daytime events or meet during the week to do things since my schedule is very flexible during the day. They always say, \"oh we'll try that for the next time\", but it never happens.\n\nLast month was the last straw. My birthday fell on a Sunday, and I asked them if we could do a celebration during the day since I was working that night, and they agreed. Then the day before my celebration the group chat exploded that they were actually now changing it to evening because \"Sarah's babysitter cancelled but can do 7pm instead\".\n\nI was so done at that point. I made my own plans for my birthday with my coworkers who were able to show up and post pictures on social media having the best time at brunch and escaping an escape room.\n\nNow my original friend group is hurt that I \"didn't even tell them\" we changed the plans. They are now calling me petty and that I should understand that finding childcare is hard, but I'm ov√®r being the only one who is expected to accommodate everyone else 100% of the time. \n\nBut I think my job counts as an adult responsibility too and I shouldn't have to miss my own birthday for their babysitter problems.\n\nAITA here?",

We were nervous.\n\nThings did seem better and we thought maybe we really could have them in our lives again. I missed them. My brother ruined it.

Then he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never get how you could give up being a mom for a guy who won‚Äôt even mow the lawn.‚Äù\n\nBecause James passed out while he was mowing the lawn because of the sun and heat exposure. Since then, I mow the lawn. They know about this. It was a scary time for me.\n\nI said he needs to watch it. He rolled his eyes at me and said that it‚Äôs not fair that he can‚Äôt even be himself and say what‚Äôs on his mind with his own family just because ‚Äúthat pendejo‚Äù is here. Mmhm. I set my nephew down and walked away and told James it was time to go.\n\nMy mom called me while we were on the road. I told her what happened and she said ‚ÄúDios mio you are really this mad about such a little comment?‚Äù We argued over it until it became a screaming match and she called me a bad daughter to cause her this stress on her birthday and that it seems like I was just waiting for one of them to screw up. And that I have a problem with allowing other people to have opinions. And I should understand the family is upset we won't have kids because any family would be.\n\nThat last part is what I am caught on and why I might be the asshole. Does me not wanting them to speak bad things on James mean I‚Äôm stopping them from being honest which I guess they SHOULD be allowed to be? Does that make me the asshole? And for leaving and causing a scene yes but that's not the big part.\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "One of my friends has been complaining about money a lot recently. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where two days ago she said that she was so broke she wasn‚Äôt able to afford to eat and was skipping whole days worth of eating because she just had no food. \n\nI felt sympathy because I‚Äôve struggled a lot with finances, I still do a little bit but not as badly as I used to. Since I‚Äôm doing okay enough to right now, I offered to help her out with food. \n\nI do a budgeting plan with my meals/meal prep where I use these compartment containers and I‚Äôll make 10 portions of 3 different meals every two weeks. I rotate the menu based on what‚Äôs on sale. Then I put them into my deep freezer. I have adhd and this works really well for me. I have a bit of extra meal stock at the moment because I don‚Äôt always eat all the prepared trays before I make the next batch since i always do it every two weeks. I have around 25 extra meals in my freezer right now. \n\nSince I have extra, I was originally just gonna not meal prep at the start of next week, but instead I decided to offer to drop my friend off some of my surplus so she has something to eat. \n\nI was gonna drop it off today after work, but right when I was getting off work I was watching Snapchat stories and saw she posted one. She went and got a tattoo today as part of a Friday the 13th flash thing. I‚Äôm familiar with the artist who did the tatt because I recognized their flash from their instagram. I was considering going in for one but didn‚Äôt do it cause I don‚Äôt really have the extra money rn. They‚Äôre all pre priced prices and that one is $180 \n\nIdk why but it kinda pmo because she literally just told me about how she was so broke she couldn‚Äôt afford to eat, but yet was able to pay for a tattoo. When I was struggling financially I def didn‚Äôt get tattoos. I messaged her about it and asked about how she was able to afford a tattoo and she basically just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always able to scrounge up cash for new tattoos‚Äù \n\nI then told her that I‚Äôm not bringing her those meals because if she has enough for a new tattoo, she must not be that desperate. She freaked out on me and called me a bitch and said I was being classist and that poor people are allowed to have nice things. Which I do agree with, but I feel like it doesn‚Äôt apply to this situation. But now I feel like an asshole and my friend is mad at me. Aita? ",

One doesn't eat mushrums, you eat mushrooms. He got defensive immediately and told me he met someone at another smoke shop and he was certain I was pronouncing it wrong. I tried to literally spell it out for him but he wouldn't budge, and just kept telling me it was a \"play on words\" and that I didn't get it. I emailed the company for some clarification and wouldn't you know it I was correct. He came back in today and asked if I had any Shrum-Fuzzed bars, and I told him I emailed the company to see how it was pronounced and I was right. He AGAIN told me I was wrong because he met someone from the company at an expo event, so I offered to show him the email so he could see and he told me to fuck off that his ego wasn't that big and to leave it alone as he stormed out of the store.

      "scenario_description": "I (21m) was hanging out with my closest friend group (5 guys total) I‚Äôve had since high school when something odd happened. Suddenly, after years of using the word himself (and all of us regularly using it), one friend (D) was taken aback by another friend (N) saying the word ‚Äúretarded.‚Äù\n\nHe made a big deal of it being a ‚Äúslur‚Äù and shamed N for using it liberally. When N questioned this shift, D replied, ‚ÄúWhy use a slur? It‚Äôs just not cool to say anymore.‚Äù\n\nFor context, we‚Äôve been super close since freshman year of high school. Now, the summer before senior year of college, we‚Äôre still close but less so due to naturally attending different schools. We used to hang out every weekend‚Äîsmoking weed, drinking beers, playing Super Smash Bros, DnD, etc. We‚Äôre not big ‚Äútrash-talkers‚Äù either; growing up in a nice area with solid education instilled values of kindness and respect. We‚Äôre mostly just goofy nerds.\n\nThere‚Äôs an unspoken understanding that we‚Äôre generally left-wing. Growing up in progressive areas instilled these ideals. I‚Äôve personally shifted slightly toward the center after finding my place in the world, but I remain a big proponent of basic human rights and equality. Same goes for everyone else in the group. When we made ‚Äúedgy‚Äù jokes, it was always understood as satire‚Äîfunny because it‚Äôs opposite of our real beliefs. For example, making Hitler jokes since 4 out of 5 of us are Jewish.\n\nNow, six years later, there‚Äôs a sudden shift in group vibe‚Äînot because N and I desperately need to say ‚Äúoh that was retarded‚Äù during Smash, but because there‚Äôs now tension and authority in the group. D and another guy (R) are suddenly very anti-slur, while N and I (still quite left-wing in our beliefs) see no issue as long as these words aren‚Äôt used derogatorily. That just wouldn‚Äôt be cool. The last guy (J) seems neutral‚Äîprobably doesn‚Äôt care about ‚Äúslurs‚Äù and just wants to have fun.\n\nNo one even used ‚Äúretard‚Äù specifically to be funny. Maybe in funny situations, sure, but it‚Äôs more synonymous with ‚Äústupid‚Äù than purely for shock value. The sudden contempt for this usage seems to give D and R an air of superiority, as if censoring these words makes them more mature. If it slips now, the vibe immediately feels off (though we avoid comments or lectures if lucky).\n\nAm I the asshole, or does D‚Äôs sudden judgment of ‚Äúretard‚Äù stem more from conformist indulgence in censorship among modern leftists rather than a genuine push for good?\n\nI understand removing it from medical dictionaries since it‚Äôs antiquated. I‚Äôd never use it for someone with disabilities. But bringing woke rules into a chill night with the boys? Seems retarded.",

It‚Äôs nothing fancy, but it‚Äôs a good, stable spot for me and my 6-year-old son. Around that time, my younger brother Tyrell (24M) and his girlfriend Amber (22F) got evicted and asked if they could crash with me for a while. I didn‚Äôt really want to, but they had nowhere else, and I figured it‚Äôd just be temporary.\n\nAt first, it was fine. But after about a month, they started getting way too comfortable. Ignoring house rules I set ‚Äî like no random people over when I‚Äôm not home, no smoking in the house, and being respectful when my son is there.\n\nInstead? They had people in and out while I was at work, left the place trashed, blasted music while my son was sleeping, and I caught Amber smoking in the bathroom twice.\n\nThe biggest issue, though, was how they disrespected my son‚Äôs mother. Now ‚Äî me and my baby moms aren‚Äôt together, but we‚Äôre cool. She picks up our son on weekends and sometimes drops him off at the house. Well, Amber took it upon herself to start making little slick comments whenever my son‚Äôs mom came by. Petty, unnecessary stuff like, ‚Äúoh, you actually showed up this time‚Äù or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know you still cared‚Äù.\n\nMy son‚Äôs mom kept it classy, but she told me it made her uncomfortable, and I agreed it was out of pocket.\n\nI confronted them about everything and Tyrell tried to downplay it like ‚Äúshe was just joking‚Äù and told me to stop being sensitive. That was the last straw for me.\n\nI gave them 30 days to find somewhere else. Of course, now I‚Äôm the bad guy. My mom‚Äôs blowing up my phone saying ‚Äúfamily sticks together‚Äù and ‚Äúthey just need guidance.‚Äù Amber‚Äôs been posting subliminals on Facebook about ‚Äúfake people who pretend to help you then turn their back.‚Äù\n\nBut I don‚Äôt care.

      "scenario_description": "Husband (we will call Brad), and I have been together 2.5 years. Had our son in January. Things have been pretty great, but this had me feeling kind of...annoyed?\n\nBrad is diagnosed with autism and ADHD, which can make communication between us challenging at times, but we do our best.\n\nWe live in Europe, NOT US.\n\nSince Brad has AuDHD, he only works at 50%, the other half is covered by a health insurance here on a temporary basis, and every few months he has to keep applying for more. It is stressful, as we wait for him to hopefully get on a permanent coverage. Since this is so up in the air, instead of me taking a full year of mat leave, he took a majority of the days in case his temp health insurance is denied for some reason, then he can keep his work schedule at 50% and still get paid on the days he has off.\n\nWhich means I went back to work part time. I WFH as a private teacher. I choose my hours, since my students USUALLY live in different countries, I chose some in the afternoon when Brad is home with our son, and at nights, when my students would be awake and Brad is also home. I only have one student in the evening, 23:00 - 23:30 twice a week.\n\nThis is to help with some income, and we discussed this before I event went back to work. He had asked no students past midnight. So if Baby is having issues sleeping, he can take care of him and hopefully get him to sleep.\n\nWell, Brad got back on a schedule where he wants to go to bed at 23:00...every night. We try to, but with a baby, sometimes...it just does not happen. Baby sometimes will stay asleep when I put him to bed (I nurse him to sleep), and sometimes he wakes up screaming.\n\nWell, last night I told Brad I had my student at 23:00, and I would try to have Baby sleeping by then. He asked me, \"What is your plan if Baby wakes up? My bedtime is 23:00, so hopefully you have thought of something.\"\n\nI said, \"Well, hopefully he stays asleep. If not, you will just have to take care of him, or put him on his play mat and entertain him.\"\n\nHe resolutely said, \"Bedtime is 23:00, and I will go to bed.\"\n\nCome 23:00, Baby is in bed, and Brad is just getting out of the shower. I guess he woke up moments after I started with my student, as when I came out of the office, he was walking around with Baby. I took him, nursed him back to sleep and went to bed also shortly after 23:30.\n\nThis morning, he was a bit annoyed with me. When I tried to hug him good-bye as he was leaving to work, he did not hug me back. We always do this before he leaves, so I said, \"Are you upset with me still?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Yes, you crossed my boundry. My bedtime is 23:00. We disucssed this. I go to bed, and anything past that is your problem to solve if Baby wakes up.\"\n\nHe left for work...and I was just thinking...what??\n\nI feel I need to have some discussion with Brad about this, but WIBTAH if I told him he has no more boundries with his sleep and he is being ridiculous?\n\nEDIT: Update in comments/profile",

But he gets real nasty when I achieve something that he didn‚Äôt. Every pogrom or things like that he is passive aggressive towards me. And god forbid if I start posting Something on social media. He would start posting Against it. He is a very private person but now he is leaving derogatory comments too. For example, \" If I like a certain person/ groups/ influencer, He would start posting Against them and leave derogatory remarks. Also even when it Doesn't match his taste, he would post stories about it. I don't know if I explained it properly or not. English is not my first language so pardon any mistakes.  I have been noticing this for quite a long time now. Other times, he is the sweetest guy ever. He treats me so good and gives me flowers. But these things are just I don't know what to say.",

A lot of ‚Äúthis is how he expects you to dress‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just a trophy for him‚Äù type of stuff. I thought this was a huge overreaction. Like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs definitely not her style but I didn‚Äôt think it was THAT bad. So I told her to just get the dress and stop overthinking it.¬†\n\nThey tore into me saying I‚Äôm a pick me and how he should love her how she is instead of trying to get her to change into something she‚Äôs not. I said I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs trying to do but they told me that I don‚Äôt get it.\n\nI am so worried that me saying to just get the dress was the wrong thing to do. I do have trouble knowing when people want support and encouragement versus solutions. Did I misread the situation and this was a ‚Äúsupport, not solutions‚Äù type of thing?",

      "scenario_description": "I(23f) have a friend group with five women including me. Their ages range between 21-26). This happened yesterday and I need opinions on whether I was right to walk out without paying or wrong for doing so. \n\nSo yesterday was my friend's Lily(21f) birthday. She just turned 21 and wanted a birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant. Me and four other girls were in attendance. All of my friends drink aside from me. I'm not a drinker, have never been one, and will never be one. \n\nMe and my friends get seated down and Lily all happy suggests me to buy an alcoholic beverage. I refused and the rest of my friends decided to chime in and tells me to get one. Once again I refuse. They know I don't drink and how I feel abt it. But basically them begging me to get a drink kept going on for about five minutes. Even sent the waiter away because I hadn't agreed yet. \n\nI'm not good under pressure especially when multiple ppl are telling me to do one thing. I eventually said yes though because they kept begging. Lily even suggested a drink and said it's for \"beginners\" whatever that means. I told them I didn't want it and that I know I won't like it. They said I will... \n\nThe drink came and as I stated I didn't like it. One sip and I wanted it gone. They told me to keep trying it but I refused and luckily they just dropped it.\n\nAnyways the bill comes and I separated the meal that I got from the drink. They all asked me why I did that as I should be buying the drink.??? I said I wasn't buying it since I didn't willingly get it. They begged me to get it knowing I didn't want it. Lily said I could've said no.. I DID!! Many times at that. \n\nThey kept going back and forth with me on it and eventually I just got up and walked out the restaurant. I sent the money for my meal to Lily and stated that if she or no one else was going to buy the drink then they shouldn't have begged me to got it. My husband stated I wasn't in the wrong and that I should distance myself from them. However the texts messages from all four of them haven't stoped. ",

      "scenario_description": "(Sorry for the grammar, I meant \"WIBTA For RESCINDING AN  invitation to a concert?\". I was using talk to text while walking.)\n\nI (30 female), bought tickets to an outdoor concert that has multiple headliners. I originally planned to go with my brother(35) and sister-in-law(33).\nMy friend(35 female) likes the same music and I invited her to join us. I bought the tickets and paid for the hotel rooms and whatever small things we might need while we fry in the hot southern sun and headbang. My brother is on the spectrum as am I and has two kids that are severely autistic. My original plan was to treat my brother and sister-in-law because they provided 24 hour care due to the severity of my niece(12) and nephew's(6) autism. They are very dedicated and loving parents that don't think about doing things for themselves and I wanted to treat them to a few hours of fun while the kids and grandma enjoy the hotel. My mom will be watching the kids(as she had done before) while the adult kids enjoy heavy metal nostalgia. \nThe problem is, my friend has not been able to find someone to watch her son(6). She shares custody with his dad and she will have him the weekend of the concert. My brother has severe anxiety, and opening up to new people is difficult for him. I knew I was taking a risk by asking my friend to go, but now she wants to bring her son to the concert. He's an awesome kid and loves concerts, but my brother already has a lot of anxiety and feels guilty for leaving his kids for a few hours. I don't mind my friend bringing her son, but the original plans were to have time to be adults and hang out without the kiddos for a little while.\nMy mom will have her hands full with my niece and nephew's special need. I wouldn't ask her to watch another child that might not understand why my niece and nephew don't play or talk like other kids their age.\nI'm not opposed to her bringing someone else to watch her son and hang out at the hotel and swim in the pool, but she hasn't been able to find anyone that can go on such short notice. I have been planning this trip for six weeks and she just told me she will have to bring him along to the venue.\nIt will be hot, loud, and crowded. I don't think her son will last long in the hot sun at a heavy metal concert that has 5 to 6 headliners. Would I be a jerkface for rescinding my invitation to the concert and explaining why? \n\nUpdate: she didn‚Äôt take it well. She suggested other solutions including asking her oldest child to watch him. Her oldest kid has a mild form of a serious mental illness and gets anxiety very easily. I didn‚Äôt think this was a reasonable solution and I don‚Äôt want her kids to go through the hassle and anxiety. My brother would have a panic attack if he knew the situation and the details. \nSomeone in the comments mentioned to remind her we can attend different events in the future and that I will miss her. She was somewhat calm but asked me if I didn‚Äôt want her to go. I would not have asked her to go or put myself through this situation if I didn‚Äôt want her to go. I love my friends and feel lucky to have them. She seemed more upset that she wouldn‚Äôt see a certain band and not that we couldn‚Äôt hang out. I have a really hard time with conflict and I don‚Äôt always understand social reactions and interactions. I feel really bad but this event is for my family and requires me to prioritize their needs and comfort. \nThank you all for your advice. I hope she will talk to me after and we can overcome this and have a stronger friendship. I‚Äôm going to take a nap because my head hurts and I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night. Thanks again and I will update on how the concert goes if anyone wants to know. ",

      "scenario_description": "Me (35) and him (39) have been together for 17 years. During that time, he's always had trouble with mornings, but used to be able to get up and get into work or whatever else he was doing that day.\n\nOver the past 4 years or so, he's had more and more trouble going to sleep - he's out tinkering in his shop until 2, 3 sometimes 5AM. He's drinking beer every night, though there are times he cuts back to 2-3 beers per night. I mostly quit drinking about a year ago.\n\nSo when it comes time to wake up in the morning, it's a struggle for him. He'll set 3-4 alarms over the course of an hour and a half usually between 9-10, and sleep through all of them. He's super angry when he wakes up whether I have a part in it or not.\n\nWhenever I try to wake him up, it's always one of these things with varying degrees of yelling and aggressiveness:\n-\"I'M SORE I NEED TO LAY HERE\" *falls back asleep for 3 hours* (he does do some manual labor, but seems to have a very slow recovery time and acts like he's sore almost every day and doesn't see this as a problem)\n-\"SHHHH\" *rolls over and goes back to sleep*\n-\"I'M ALREADY AWAKE I'M JUST LAYING HERE\" *falls back asleep*\n-\"YOU'RE NOT HELPING, I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE \" *falls back asleep*\n-\"SHUT THE FUCK UP\"\n\nYou get the idea. I've also tried just leaving him alone and letting him sleep - however I simply just need him to go to work sometimes so his paycheck isn't too small to pay bills. We also own a trailer rental business together and he will sleep through our shared commitments if I don't wake him.\n\nThis week we had a rough week. Lots of problems with the trailer out on rental. He shoveled gravel for 2 days. Life stuff. Hard week. Saturday we both had friend commitments but we agreed Sunday we'd need to wake up at a decent time and make plans for what to accomplish that day and talk about our ongoing financial problems. We agree. We agree on a time-10:30AM.\n\n10:30 rolls around. No alarm from his side of bed. I wait until 10:45 and get out of bed. I make coffee and come back to the room about 11:15 and start cleaning the room. At this point I say a gentle \"Hey\" and try to gently wake him up.\n\nHe says a combination of \"sore/tired/I'm waking up.\"\n\nI continue quietly cleaning the room. He gets mad and yells out that I'm just doing that to torture him. I tell him it feels like he's avoiding the things we need to talk about today.\n\nThis turns into a 1 hour fight where he tells me that he meant to set his alarm, it must not have saved. He also tells me that he is tired and shouldn't have to wake up on a Sunday. The fighting got extremely bad and I'm sobbing and decide this was the last time.\n\nI packed my things and drove 5 hours to my parents' house. I think my marriage is over and I keep thinking, am I the asshole for expecting him to keep his promise to wake up? Or am I just crazy for doing this 1,000+ times?\n",

After she set it up, I noticed that she was taking photos of the spread. While I understand why she wanted to promote her work on social media, I didn't feel comfortable with her photos. Not only was my home pretty visible in the photos, but as part of the table decorations, my husband had set up lots of family photos that were visible between all of the dishes. Due to the layout of the decorations, there was no way the photos could be avoided in any pictures. \n\nI kindly asked her to not take photos, and to her credit she did stop. But there was definitely a lot of tension and and she left quickly in a bit of a huff. A few hours later, she sent me an email saying that taking photos of her work when she was finished was normal, and that she thought I had acted unprofessionally. She also said that I was impacting her ability to get clients by preventing her from using the photos on social media. \n\nI told her that we paid her in full for the work, and she had never discussed taking pictures of the spread. I also explained that her photos clearly captured personal family photos which violated my privacy. She only responded by saying that it was no different than if someone took a picture of me in a public space. I begged to differ because it's not like a stranger would have burst into the delivery room to take pictures of giving birth to my first daughter!\n\nMy friend heard about the exchange (I was venting a little at a dinner with my girlfriends), and she said that she understood where the caterer was coming from, and that her daughter also relies on social media for clients for her business. \n\nThe table was kind of split, and I guess I wanted an unbiased opinion on whether or not I was being too sensitive about the whole thing. I appreciate any feedback! ",

      "scenario_description": "I (18F soon 19) am currently in my last year of my level 4 Marketing Course. We are required to pass (get 50 marks or higher) all units that come with the course. I am planning to study Bachelors of Arts in Buisness Enterprise in level 6 next year. So far, I am doing well in classes.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the majority of the assignments are to be done as group work. Unfortunately I had no good friends in class at the time when we had to find groups to work with. I stayed with the group of kids that are the party and clubbing type who had an open spot for me to work with them since other groups were full up. Unfortunately they either procrastinate or the few work they do they copy paste from Chat GPT. They left me panicking scared I will be fail the units and I will have to do a resit exam which if I fail as well, I will have to repeat it next year.\n\nI chase after them to get the work done and in class always tell me they didn't begin yet, we have been given the assignments to work on since March and the deadlines are next Wednesday and Friday. Meanwhile, online they leave me on delivered and eventually seen. I gave them many chances and opportunities to contact me but none of them bothered. I annoyed them many times and one of them replied arrogantly. \n\nThe teachers of the assignments I have with the crazy group with, they both gave me permission to do the assignments on my own, making them get a 0. Today is the first time in a long time that they spoke to me and things weren't pretty. They were angry because they found out they will be awarded a 0 for their assignments. One of them sent me an arrogant voice message and another accused me of letting them wait until I finish my part of the assignment so they csn begin, while when i did actually finish mine, they never answered me until a few days later. Just like they did to me, I decided to leave them on delivered for a few hours, then on seen.\n\nI kind of feel guilty as I didn't ask to be in this situation and I feel like ill get into trouble for it. One of them also said if they get a 0, something serious will happen. I'm a bit worried now.\n\nAITA",

But he didn't believe me. And now he tow away my personal router. I got a personal one for the reason so many devices are connected to our home router so it works at snails phase.\n\nAm I the ahole here or is am I in the right?\n\nEdit: after talking with my father we came forward to it's not my fault and it's the router getting overwhelmed because it's 20/15 years old.

      "scenario_description": "I (20M) live in a uni flat with another student. My flatmate (20M) recently started dating someone who smokes.\n\nWhen she first started coming over, she smoked inside the flat, which I had an issue with. I asked him to speak to her about it, and for a week or two she started going outside to smoke, which was totally fine with me.\n\nBut lately she‚Äôs started smoking inside again, usually by hanging out the window in his bedroom or living room. The problem is, the smoke still drifts back in, and the flat ends up smelling like cigarettes. It‚Äôs gross, and I hate it.\n\nI‚Äôve asked politely and multiple times that she stop smoking in the flat altogether. I explained that smoking by the window doesn‚Äôt magically stop the smell or smoke from affecting the flat. But my flatmate told me I‚Äôm being unreasonable. He said she‚Äôs already ‚Äúmaking an effort‚Äù by doing it at the window, and that it‚Äôs unfair of me to ask her to go all the way outside. He claims:\n\n* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only a temporary smell‚Äù\n* ‚ÄúThe toxins are negligible‚Äù\n* ‚ÄúYou breathe in worse stuff from cars outside anyway‚Äù\n\nHe‚Äôs completely dismissed my concerns and says I‚Äôm overreacting. He also said that both me and his girlfriend ‚Äúmake valid points‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt agree that tar or smoke particles are an issue indoors, or that they‚Äôll cling to walls or make our clothes smell.\n\nFor context: I don‚Äôt smoke, I‚Äôve never smoked, and I don‚Äôt want to live in a place that smells like it. I don‚Äôt care if people smoke, just not in the home I also pay to live in. I think that‚Äôs a pretty normal and fair boundary.\n\nIt‚Äôs now gotten to the point where I feel like I either need to escalate it to the landlord or make a formal complaint. I told him he should ask other people what they think, since right now he's only spoken to me and his gf about it which might be clouding his judgement.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for insisting that my flatmate‚Äôs girlfriend either smokes properly outside or not at all when she‚Äôs here? Or am I just being overly sensitive about it? And if I‚Äôm not in the wrong here, what can I actually do to get this to stop without making things tense in the flat?\n\nEdit:  \nThe flat contract doesn't allow smoking.\n\n**UPDATE**:\n\nMy flatmate spoke to me again about the smoking. He suggested that his girlfriend could just stick her head further out the window to stop the smell. I told him calmly that I don‚Äôt think that really changes anything, and said that if it keeps happening, I‚Äôll have to contact the landlord.\n\nAt that point, he completely lost it. He started shouting, got aggressive, and called me pathetic, trying to compare her smoking indoors to him ‚Äúlighting candles‚Äù (which is also against the lease). I stayed calm and just reiterated that if it continues, I‚Äôll have to raise it with the landlord.\n\nHe then launched into another torrent of abuse before storming out of the room.\n\nHonestly, at this point it‚Äôs gone way beyond a disagreement about smoking. I feel like I should be able to have a basic, respectful conversation without him becoming hostile. I really don‚Äôt want to escalate this to the landlord because I know it‚Äôll bring a whole load of stress and drama, but if it happens again, I don‚Äôt see another option.\n\nI‚Äôm also now wondering whether I need to report his behaviour separately, because this kind of aggression isn‚Äôt something I expected to have to deal with in my own flat.",

      "scenario_description": "A couple of weeks ago my partner (34M) asked if his friend, ‚ÄúLenny‚Äù (50s? M) could stay in my apartment while I (32F) was away on an international trip. I live alone (my partner lives with friends nearby.) The original ask was that Lenny stay for three days over the weekend while he was in town teaching a workshop. I had misgivings, as Lenny has a history of being a bit difficult, and the last time he stayed with my partner, drama ensued. However, given the fact that my partner was willing to vouch for Lenny, and would be nearby to make sure things were okay, I consented to allowing him to crash at my place. My only request was that Lenny not bring any guests over.\n\n\nThe first day of my trip, I received texts from my partner saying that Lenny thought I had termites, and asking if three of Lenny‚Äôs students could stay at my apartment for one night. I was pretty frustrated (and admittedly cranky from jet lag) about being contacted about these things while abroad, and declined to host the students (who I‚Äôve never met). I assured my partner that what Lenny thought was termite dust was actually insect poison left by the exterminator. Things were a bit tense as I shared my frustration with my partner, but we were able to pretty effectively resolve the issue and move on. \n\n\nTwo days later, I‚Äôm chatting with my partner on the phone and he mentions Lenny. I‚Äôm confused because, according to my recollection, Lenny should have already left our area. My partner then lets me know that Lenny had asked to extend his stay, and my partner had forgotten to let me know/ask me if the extension was alright. The stay is more than double what I‚Äôd originally agreed to (8 days instead of 3) and my partner would be out of town for the last couple of days of Lenny‚Äôs trip. I found this to be pretty upsetting/disrespectful, and expressed as much. My partner was taken aback by the intensity of my reaction, and felt like it shouldn‚Äôt be as big of an issue as I was making it. \n\n\nMy partners position was that, since I‚Äôd be out of town for the duration of Lenny‚Äôs stay, he‚Äôd assumed that I wouldn‚Äôt care whether Lenny stayed a couple of extra days. For him, having guests is not a big deal as he has a pretty casual approach to hosting. I‚Äôm generally less trusting and more protective of my space.\n\n\nAfter thinking about things overnight, the next morning I asked my partner to find alternative housing for at least the part of Lenny‚Äôs trip that he‚Äôd be out of town for, and to arrange cleaning for after Lenny leaves. My partner agreed, but was hurt by my reaction and, to a certain extent, the severity of my requests. \n\n\nTL;DR: My partner allowed his friend to stay in my apartment for longer than I‚Äôd agreed to while I was traveling internationally. I got upset and asked him to find the friend alternative housing/hire a cleaner for after he leaves. Now my partner is also upset with me and I‚Äôm wondering if I overreacted. \n\n\nAITA?",
