      "scenario_description": "Okay, I’m not really a Reddit user, but I have an account, and so does my brother, who’s part of this story. I’m using a fake one just in case he sees this, because it could make things worse.\n\nMy husband and I are financially comfortable. We both work(ed) in the dental field. I sold my practice about a year ago, and he plans to sell his in a few years.\n\nI have two older brothers and two younger sisters. This is about my 47-year-old brother. He lost his job during COVID and hasn’t been able to hold one down since. His wife got a job through a family friend, but they still struggle financially, especially with four kids. I try to help when I can. I’ve paid for school supplies, groceries, toys, games, activities, and I take the kids out once or twice a month to give them a break.\n\nTheir oldest, my 12-year-old niece, has been acting out.\n\nIt started last Christmas. I hosted a cousin sleepover for winter break. In six days, she:\n\n1. Got mad during a game and smashed the iPad I bought for the kids\n2. Broke a vase while roughhousing\n3. Refused to go skiing and trashed the cabin while we were gone\n4. Was mean to the other kids\n\nAfterward, I talked to her and her parents and we moved on.\n\nThis week we celebrated my birthday (May 5th) a little late because I was on a trip with a small party. Catered food, played a few games, nothing big. During the party, my niece asked if she could take the new iPad home. I said no, given what happened last time. Turns out she took it anyway. The next day (around 3 days ago) my brother called to tell me she broke it.\n\nI know it’s just an iPad and she didn’t hurt anyone, but that was the last straw. I told my brother she’s no longer welcome at my house, but the other kids still are.\n\nThat’s when my sister-in-law called me and blew up on me, called me a selfish bitch, and said none of her kids would be coming over anymore because she won’t let one be excluded and doesn’t want my “attitude” rubbing off on them. I hung up on her and she sent a string of nasty texts. I texted my brother to at least calm her down, but he hasn’t responded, and I know he read it because of his read receipts.\n\nSo. AITA for banning my niece from coming over but not the other kids? I need advice. I feel like I’ve done so much for them, and yet I’m disrespected at every turn.\n\nHello, everyone. Sorry this update took so long. I’ll try to address the things I saw in the comments.\n\nNo, I didn’t end up calling the cops, but I did eventually get my niece’s parents to agree to a payment plan for the iPads. Some people pointed out that they might’ve sold the iPad or it’s not broken and they just want to keep it. After this whole thing, I don’t put it past them. I did ask if they knew she took the iPad, and they said they didn’t, so I’ll take that at face value.\n\nYes, I am going no contact.\n\nFor the people who want to know how she broke it, my other niece told me she slammed it on the floor (wood) and then threw it when she tried to take it away from her.\n\nMost importantly, no, there’s no abuse of any kind. For the people who said she’s acting out because of what her parents have been saying about me behind closed doors, you were right. I did also ask my other siblings if it’s just me she’s acting like that towards and they said she’s been a little difficult but not giving them as hard of a time as me. So it’s a mix of hormones and her parents.\n\nAnd for the few who asked, no, the plan wasn’t to ban her out of my life completely while still accepting her other siblings and parents, it was for her to reflect on her actions. Like time out. But like I said, that ship has sunk. And I wish there were more I can do because their other kids just got caught in the crossfire.\n\nI did mention therapy and they definitely didn’t like that.\n\nAnd I think it’s important to mention that the only reason I got them to talk to me is because they did come back to ask me for stuff. So for the people who said that would happen, you were also right.\n\nI’m so sad things turned out this way. Family is very important to me. That’s why I tried to salvage things for so long.\n\nAgain, thank you for all of your input even if I wasn’t able to respond to you!\n\n(I did put this in the comments, but I figured it’s probably better to add this to the post.)",

      "post_title": "AITA for buying myself an Xbox when my bf said he got me one for my birthday last year?",
      "scenario_description": "FINAL UPDATE: I ended things with him today. I couldn’t do it on the phone so I did it over text. Everything he said proved that you were all right. He’s trying to manipulate me back into the relationship, but I’m at my breaking point. Thank you all for your help on this. \n\nMy bf(20yo) and I(24yo) have been dating for about a year and a half now. We’re long distance and he’s been out here to visit me about four times, for weeks at a time. Last year on my birthday(in June), he had told me he got me an Xbox. I was really excited because I’ve had mine since 2016. We met for the first time last October. He didn’t bring it with him that time. No big deal. He only had a small bag that time. Fast forward to December, he came out for Christmas. He bought a bigger bag, and even asked if he could bring his PS5 so we could play games together and I said yes. After Christmas he went home, and I asked about the Xbox. Whenever I asked him he got frustrated and said I was nagging him about it but he’ll just send it to me in the mail. A few weeks go by, and nothing. So I ask him again, and he gets really upset again. He said it was in a box under his bed and he didn’t want to deal with it right now. It got to the point where I just said that it didn’t matter whether or not he bought it I just wanted to know. We go into a huge fight about it again, and I told him I wanted proof that he actually had it. He sent me a picture of the box. I was suspicious about it because he had mentioned to me before that his best friend had the same Xbox I wanted. So in my head I was thinking that he had just taken a picture of his friends old Xbox box. But I promised him I’d let it go after he sent the picture, so I didn’t bring it up. That was sometime in January. My birthday is coming up again, and we were on the phone and he was talking about things to get me. For his birthday I had gotten him a game and a vinyl wrap for his PS5, so I had told him a wrap for the Xbox would be cool(my way of hinting that I wanted my Xbox), and he said no and that he’d think of something better. I promised him I wouldn’t bring it up again, but.. it’s been almost a year. He’s coming out for my birthday, so I thought maybe he’d bring it. We were texting about my gift the other day and he had mentioned he needed to buy what he was getting me. So to me, it sounded like he wasn’t bringing it. I’ve been wanting this Xbox for so long, and I was sick of waiting so I went looking on eBay and bought one. It’s coming this weekend, so I had to tell him. I told him not to be mad, but I bought myself the Xbox. I tried to explain my reasoning and that I didn’t want to wait anymore because my Xbox now barely works. But he got so mad at me and just said “that was a f***ing waste of $500” so I offered to pay him back for it and he said he doesn’t want my money. Now he’s really upset with me and it has me questioning if it was messed up that I ended up buying the Xbox for myself.\n\nTL;DR. My boyfriend told me he bought me an Xbox for my birthday last year in June, he never brought it. I bought it for myself and now he’s pissed at me. AITA?\n\n\nUPDATE: He ended up sending a long text this morning about how pissed he was and that it was stupid that I bought it for myself. He was going to bring it, the only reason he didn’t tell me was because it was supposed to be a surprise for my birthday. He said he’s pissed because he bought more accessories for the Xbox too, so he’s spent well over $600, but now that I bought one for myself I should keep it and he’s not going to give me anything he got.\n\nI told him that he should’ve just sent it in the first place and it wouldn’t have got to the point where I had to buy it myself. I also explained that I didn’t need expensive gifts and that if he didn’t get it for me and just wanted to impress me, he should’ve told me when I gave him the opportunity to come clean. \n\nHe explained the reason everything was so expensive was because I liked gaming and legos (which are expensive) so it wasn’t to impress me. He apologized because he made me so upset about it for so long, and that he didn’t think about it because it was under his bed. \n\nI told him I felt like he never listened or cared about it because I had “nagged” him multiple times about sending it but he somehow still forgot. \n\nHe apologized for being lazy and making it seem like he didn’t care about it, how he should’ve brought it in the first place, and that he was wrong for not doing that.\n\nI’m even more conflicted at this point, maybe I should’ve just waited for my birthday but it genuinely sounded like he wasn’t going to bring it.

      "scenario_description": "I used to do the grocery runs. It just made sense, I had a car, and my roommate, didn’t. Once a week, he’d text me a list, I’d grab the stuff, and later he’d transfer me the money. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but after a while, I started noticing a pattern.\n\nEvery time, every single time, he’d send me less than the total. If something came out to $54.48, he’d send me $54.00. Once, the total was $46.89, and he sent $46.00. I mean, really? It wasn’t about the money, I wasn’t going to go bankrupt over a few cents, but it rubbed me the wrong way. I’m the kind of person who balances their expenses down to the penny. \n\nStill, I kept quiet for months. I’d just sigh, shake it off, and move on. Maybe I was being petty, I thought. Maybe I shouldn’t let it get to me.\n\nBut yesterday, I was already having a rough day, and when he sent me his usual “grab me a few things?” text, something inside me snapped. I told him no. Said I wasn’t up for it, and then, when i came home, i finally told him why.\n\n“You never send the right amount,” I said. “You always round down, and honestly, it’s disrespectful.”\n\nHe was caught off guard. “Wait, seriously? It’s just a few cents. I don't count pennies because it’s easier that way. You’re literally the only person who’s ever complained about this.”\n\nI told him I was a precise person. That it wasn’t about the cents, it was about the principle. The consistency. The consideration.\n\nHe scoffed, stood up, pulled a $20 bill from his wallet, and tossed it on the table. “Here. Take it. Since those cents are so important to you.”\n\nThen he walked away and hasn’t said a word to me since.\n\nAt first, I felt vindicated. But later that night, sitting alone with that $20 still on the table, I felt awful, specially because it's probably more than he \"owned\" me. The truth is, I didn’t need those cents. But I hated feeling like I was being taken advantage of. I didn’t want to be in a fight with him, but I also couldn’t shake the feeling that he never took my effort seriously.\n\nAITA for arguing over a couple of cents with a good friend?\n",

You say it isn't about the money but it's pretty obviously about the money.  \n\nGood life lesson for you:  Never loan money to friends if you aren't willing to just set that same money on fire.  Buying stuff at the store for a friend is the same as loaning money to them.  Getting angry at friends about a few cents is a great way to lose friends.",

      "scenario_description": "I went to a local SF ice cream shop, just hoping to enjoy a treat like I usually do. When I walked in, I noticed two people eating inside with a dog that clearly wasn’t a service animal. Since it’s against California Health and Safety Code § 114259.5 to have non-service animals inside food establishments, I quietly let one of the employees know. She said she’d take care of it.\n\nBut after about 10-15 minutes, nothing happened. It felt like the staff wasn’t going to do anything, so I (probably naively) approached the two people myself and gently let them know about the law. That’s when things turned ugly. They told me the staff said it was okay, and when I explained that it actually wasn’t, they started being aggressive and mean, taking pictures of me, and threatening to put me on social media. I was honestly just trying to protect public health, not get into a confrontation. I ended up taking a photo too, just for my own safety.\n\nThe part that hurt most was that the staff didn’t step in or support me at all. The one who said she would take care of it said she had to go on break and was busy, and another said they didn’t know the law. I felt completely alone and kind of humiliated.\n\nI love this shop and have been coming for years. I’m not trying to get anyone in trouble—I just wish the staff were better trained and willing to uphold the law so customers don’t have to be put in uncomfortable or even unsafe situations.\n\nI’m tired of seeing dogs in cafes, bakeries, restaurants, etc. in SF and no one doing anything about it. But I also don’t want to come off as rude. AITA in this situation?\n\nUPDATE:\nAppreciate the different viewpoints here. To provide a but more context: (1) the dog owner stated that the dog was not a service animal, (2) I am very allergic to dogs and cat dander, and (3) I am on the spectrum and struggle to follow social cues. \n\nNot making any excuses here. I fully acknowledge that maybe I was the asshole, which is why I posted here to gain perspective. Again, thanks everyone for the comments. Will continue to read them and try and learn from them. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (33F)  hosted a 4th of July party for my friends.  A friend brought their relatively new spouse.  Met him once at a restaurant and spoke for a few minutes.  I have 2 German Shepards, Jameson & Guinness. My house is their house. I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   \n\nThis friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  \n\nI backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.  If you just pet them, they'll leave you alone.  After a brief convo, they decided to leave. I told them they don't call the shots at my house about my dogs.   The rest of my friends were split on how I acted. Some said it wasn't a big deal to put them in another room for a few hours and others said I was right.  AITA?  ",

She had a baby three months ago.\n\nI just got out of school for the summer and really wanted to rest, but my sister decided she wants to finally get a job. Now she’s making me babysit my niece. I have zero experience with babies, and I get overstimulated easily. It’s been really hard for me.\n\nI asked her if she could put the baby in daycare or something, but she refused. I decided to just suck it up, but it’s been exhausting. I have insomnia, and it’s hard to sleep when I feel like I need to be awake 24/7 to watch the baby. I’m constantly scared something might happen if I fall asleep.\n\nI told my mom how I felt, but she said I’d just have to deal with it. Both my parents work, so I’m left alone with the baby for hours almost every day.\n\nA few days ago, I got tired of everything. The night before my sister got ready for work, I snuck out and went to my friend’s house so I wouldn’t have to deal with it and could finally get some sleep. When I came home that morning after I saw all the missed calls and messages and my mom and sister were really mad at me. They said I was being selfish and lazy. My sister even quit her job because I told her I’d leave again if she kept making me babysit.\n\nI definetly felt bad after It feels like my whole family is barely talking to me except for my dad and even he said I shouldn’t have done that.\n\n(Also i love my niece this isn’t hate to her shes adorbs)\n\n\n(A little edit for more info- I see my dad being brought up a bit but he works in different places with steel work so he’s very rarely home but we do call often, my nieces father doesn’t want anything to do with her or my sister it’s been that way since she was pregant anyway so she left him and moved back in with us, she had a job before but quit to take care of the baby when she was a newborn and up until now of course, Also her and my mom work at the same place so they’re both night shift jobs and they’re tired when they come home from working so I usually have to watch my niece a bit longer so they can rest when they get home since they expect me to sleep while I’m babysitting but I just can’t I’m so paranoid something could happen, even when I’m feeding the baby and she coughs even a little or if she’s sleeping too hard I panic. And honestly I didn’t even know daycare wasn’t free until I read these comments I thought maybe it was like public school sorry)",

      "scenario_description": "I feel so bad about this whole thing. Like I’m losing sleep over this. So I (F 19) am moving into an apartment soon with three other girls, so it’ll be four of us. Our room assignments came out recently and I got the room I wanted! It’s on the far left side, it has a long hallway to the entrance and I like that it’s kinda secluded. Either way I’m happy. \n\n\nIn comes. One roommate. In the gc I see she asked me “hey would you wanna switch rooms? I’m bringing my pet rabbit, he’s small, this is the cage “ ummmm what. I see the pic of the cage, it’s one that stays on the floor with no top so it can roam around, yeah it looks big. So I basically was like “ I’m really happy with the room I got but I hope it works out 😭” because I have trouble saying NO. I get stepped on all the time. Her room doesn’t even seem that different from mine. \n\nI don’t care about size, the main reason I am saying NO to her room is because the door exits right into the living room. Like um no. I’m a light sleeper and hate noise so I love the distance I have, like I’m just so happy with it! And now I feel so guilty! Anyways. She then private messages me. Um ok. She said “hey it’s just the cage is so big and I want space etc etc. “ she says her reasonings. Then I’m like… ummm what. So I say something not too mean but like more stern. I’m like “yeah sorry but I requested that room specifically I’m happy I got it, I just don’t want to be in a room I’m uncomfortable with.” \n\n\nthen… I get voice notes , her like “yeah o just also don’t like where the door is and my parents don’t either it’s like right at the front and they don’t like how unsafe that seems. Idk have u seen his cage? It’s just really big. Also me and (her friend who’s also living with us ) we reserved the room really early so idk why we didn’t get them.” I’m not sure if her or her friend got the room they wanted, on the end. They’re both a grade above us so idk what they thought we were gonna do. \n\nANYWAYS to her voice notes I said “oh yeah I didn’t like where the door was too when I picked it, that’s why I wanted room D (my room) so I’m sorry no and I already started buying stuff so I’ll feel bad to my parents yaknow.” Anyways I feel so mean after basically saying no four times and she replied once more like “yeah it’s just super annoying because like neither of us got the room we wanted and we did this really early “ idk. \n\nThe icing on top is she actually isn’t allowed the bring her bunny. But I’m no snitch. The apartment doesn’t allow it 😐 so like. Why is this my problem. I LIKE MY ROOM. And I know I’d hate it if I switched. And I’m no anxious because why is there now drama in my future apartment. I’m gonna feel so guilty in the room and nervous around her. But why would she put in that spot? Should I have just switched? But the door bro. I told her I didn’t want to be the “quiet down” roommate because I need quiet. Ugh. I hope her bunny gets caught so she isn’t allowed to have it anyways. Who brings that to college when you know you need space??? 😩 why am I the bad guy",

I always ask what he would like and he almost always tells me nothing. we're adults and buy whatever want so it makes it difficult. I always feel like I always come up short and he never likes the gifts I give even though I tried to put a lot of thought into them. My fiance is very into RC trucks and drones. I don't know anything about them but his birthday came about and I was at a loss so I asked chat GPT. I took pictures of all his trucks and drones and the tools and spare parts and asked chat GPT what he might need or like to go with his this hobby. Chat suggested one of the cameras that mounts to his truck that would work with stuff he already had. so he can film from the trucks pov. I thought that was really cool so I bought it for him. Along with a gift card and some little things.\n Fast forward a couple months he told me today that he was so insulted and hurt that I needed chat GPT to help pick a present for him when I should know him better than that. He also collects star wars /Legos and said I should have bought him a Lego set and he would have been happy with that. His son always buys him two or three Lego sets or all matter of Star wars collectables. every Christmas ,birthday and Father's Day. \n I have bought him bought Lego sets before and they duplicated with what his son bought. I told him this and he just told me that that it didn't matter that I should have got him Star Wars Legos and that it was pathetic that I had to ask chat GPT what to get him for his birthday I'll add this man buys me the exact same gift cards for every occasion Sephora, DSW and chocolate that I don't like even like or eat. \n (After 9 years he should know i cant tolerate milk chocolate.) I always act like his gifts are the greatest thing ever and i'm in fact very appreciative of the gesture.  AITAH for asking for help from AI for gift-giving. Side note: there is no sign of camera I think he just threw the camera away. ",

      "scenario_description": "Hello! \n\nMy boyfriend (M31) has a dog, and when we have sleepovers, it's usually at his place since he can't leave her (the dog) alone overnight. Which is totally fine with me (F29).\n\nBut sometimes I prefer to sleep at my own place instead. Some nights I just want a night in my own bed, or maybe I have an early morning and it’s logistically easier to leave from my place instead of his.\n\nHe’s suggested a few times that he could bring his dog to my apartment so we can still have sleepovers there, but I’ve always said no. Nothing against his dog, I just don’t love the idea of a dog in my space! I also have a roommate and feel like I’d need to make sure she was okay with having a dog in the apartment too. \n\nI’m honestly not too pressed about not having a sleepover on those days, but he gets PISSED when I tell him no. He says I’m not good at compromising and am unappreciative of him putting in the effort to find a solution.\n\nThe way I see it, there isn’t really an “issue” that needs a solution…it’s not like I’m in distress because we couldn’t sleep in the same bed for 1 weekend. From his perspective, it seems like I don’t care enough to make something work, but to me it’s just not that serious for me to do something I’m uncomfortable with. \n\nAITA?\n\n**EDIT: I don’t hate dogs! I don’t not want a dog ever, but I don’t want a dog in my current space, which is why I do not have a dog of my own right now.**\n\n**Down the line, I could live with his dog (if we lived together, we’d get a new place, which would be more dog-friendly than my current apartment).**",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 31F and my mom (Brenda, 55F) and I are honestly pretty close. But there’s this one thing she does that’s been getting under my skin for years. Basically, if I tell her anything about my life, she’ll go and talk about it with the whole extended family. Like... everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins, even random relatives I barely know or haven’t seen in forever. Nothing’s too small—she’ll mention stuff about who I’m seeing, stuff with my job, health stuff, money stuff... just everything.\n\nI’ve told her to stop doing that so many times. Like I’ll say “hey, I don’t want anyone else knowing about this,” and she’ll nod like she gets it—but then later I hear she’s been talking. And when I call her out, she always says something like, “Oh, come on, it’s just family!” or “I wasn’t gossiping, I was just chatting.” Like??? That doesn’t really make it better.\n\nAnyway, not long ago I had this minor medical thing done—nothing serious, but definitely personal. I told her ahead of time, super clearly, that I didn’t want anyone else knowing. Just wanted to keep it to myself.\n\nThen like three days later, I start getting these “how are you feeling??” texts from a bunch of my aunts. And yep—turns out my mom told them. Again.\n\nI was honestly so frustrated. I called her and told her straight up that I felt like she didn’t respect my privacy, and that I was hurt she went and told people again after I asked her not to. I told her I need her to stop sharing my life like that—it’s not just casual chatting when it’s stuff I asked her to keep private.\n\nShe got really upset. Said I was attacking her, said I was overreacting and being cold, and now she won’t talk to me. My dad says I should’ve handled it “more gently” and that I made her feel bad. So now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far.\n\nWas I the asshole for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "My son has just had his 2nd birthday and we had a party for his friends from playgroup, my neighbour messaged me after the party saying 'the cherry on the cake' to all the shit going on in her life was that I didn't invite her autistic 8 year old son to his toddler party. \n\nShe's made me feel really guilty like I'm the reason for her upset.\n\nHer son is non verbal and smacks himself in the face if over stimulated. I didn't invite as it was a toddler party with only 5 2-3 year olds. \n\nMy living room isn't very big and I know her son is sensitive to loud noises and thought with all the screaming and fighting it wouldn't be a good idea. He also has to blow out candles even if its not his birthday, which, in my opinion isn't fair and would take focus off my boy.\n\nHe doesn't share toys and, in previous experiences, not even let my son play with his own toys in his own home, and even though the other children were fighting over toys, the parents, including mysel, were stopping snatching and inforcing sharing, even if it caused a tantrum.\n\nI am getting mixed reviews from people around me and I still personally didn't think it would be a good idea but she's made me feel like I was wrong for it.\n\nThank you for all or insights.. \n\nUpdate:-\nSince the party we had a little get together and the 2 toddlers were fighting and screaming about sharing his new toys, constantly trying to stop arguments and the neighbours son came along aswell, when ever the screaming started, it was as I feared the loud noises were too much, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere for the neighbours boy, covering his ears,  sprinting out into the communal gardens, as if he was trying to escape. It started off quietly, but then, as the toddlers got tired, it leveled up gradually. \n",

      "scenario_description": "I love my boyfriend and adore his daughter. Every year we go on a family camping trip with a group of friends. Last night, my boyfriend’s daughter let me know her friend’s parents will be dropping off their trailer where we are camping so she and her friends can stay in it. I asked how many friends and it is 6 teenage girls total. \n\nI know I will be responsible for watching, feeding all the kids, and cleaning the trailer out after the trip. My boyfriend’s daughter’s friends is fun and will take them boating in the day, but at night this group likes to party so he will not be ensuring they’re not drinking or drinking too much. I worry about something bad happening so would not be able to relax as I’d be the one “on duty”. \n\nThis sounds like a lot of work and stress and not a lot of fun for me so I have decided not to attend the trip. My boyfriend says I’m an asshole and ungrateful for not attending. AITA for skipping the trip because I don’t want to monitor 6 teenage girls?\n\n",
