      "scenario_description": "Hi I am (21f) and I’m unsure about the ages of the people involved. Yesterday I went to a concert, we had rear standing so we were separated from the general admission by another barricade, we got to the arena at around 6 (the doors opened at 5). \n\nWhen we got to the floor a lot of people were sat down sporadically all over the place with many gaps in between up u till you got to the barricade which was very tight packed. Me and my friend walked around a bit until we got to being more cramped with people sat down. We decided to stand near some people stood up to our left and 3 people sat to our right, it wasn’t super spacious but we were stood as close as everyone else in that area was to each other. On our right was two younger girls around my age and what looked like their mum, after about 10 minutes one of the girls stood up and was just stood next to us, she complimented my dress which i thanked her for, about 5 minutes later she said I’m just going to sit back down so I backed up a bit to give her some more space. 10 minutes later she stood up again and stayed there for another 15, at this point I decided to sit down myself for a bit next to her mum and other friend, I noticed the mum looking at me oddly but just smiled, she then immediately started scolding me sayings “excuse me! I’m not trying to be funny but you have came over here and stood close to us and have now stolen my daughter’s seat! How dare you!” And so on of that sort, I immediately said “I’m sorry, but please just talk/ask me nicely” I then looked up to the girl and said “let’s swap I would prefer if you sat down here instead of me please?” But she kept insisting it was fine and we went back and forth of me asking her to sit down and her saying she wants to stand. I was then sat there awkwardly for a while, my friend messaged me asking what the lady said to me and I texted him back saying what happened. Eventually I stood back up and said to the girl again “would you like some candy that I have? I’m sorry for getting in your space, please sit back down” she accepted my candy and thanked me saying she still wants to stand.  We eventually drifted apart as the crowd got bigger and the show was starting soon and my friend then told me he saw her messaging her friend saying something like “some lovely angel just gave me some candy” which makes me feel better about the whole thing but do you think I’m the asshole?\n\n(Sorry if my grammar isn’t great lol!)\n\nEdit- this occurred in rear standing so there was no actual seats here it was just a crowd of people mixed seating on the ground and some stood up as well, closer to the barricade was pretty tightly packed so we didn’t go that close.",

She asked me why I dont use microwave instead to do the oatmeal, which I replied that I want to test if there's any noticable difference in taste since she made me oatmeal yesterday that was really good. She then replies, that I'm just wasting time and \"It's just a unnecessary hassle\" to make it in the kettle. She also mentioned that I always make the oatmeal too salty, and I was using the wrong oatmeal (we have 2 different kind of oatmeal atm). I told her that if I want to make the hassle, and try things out, I will do it in the kettle and that's it. Next line from her mouth was something like \"well that's a fucking attitude you should stop right away\" or something. I told her again that I just wanted to test to make oatmeal in a different way, where she replied that when se gets off from work today, it's better that I'm not home when she comes becouse she doesn't want to start her holidays/vacation with this kind of person.

      "scenario_description": "I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. \n\nIn the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. \n\nI am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. \n\nThey’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. \n\nYesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. \n\nI had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. \n\nMy kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. \n\nBut afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. \n\nSo AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",

Thing is that she decided to look through it, specifically going on Whatsapp and looking up keyword “mom” in my chats. She looked through the chat with my dad and with my best friend.\n\nI don’t know why she would do something like this and what she was expecting to find, and i do partially believe she dug her own grave.\n\nAnyway, she found a few chats with my friend where i complained about her antics towards me and my brother (9M), how her depression shows through along with her mood swings. However me being lowkey edgy at the time (still am) i did say some messed up stuff like that she “wasn’t fit to take care of us”.\n\nThis really hurt her deeply because from that point on she periodically reminds me of what i said about her whenever we fight. She always tells my brother i hate her and i don’t care about her, making him hate me as well.\nI do NOT hate her; i was simply a stressed out 13 year old.\n\nTo me, our relationship didn’t really change that much. The occurrence is just an easy weapon for her when we fight. However she says it changed drastically, i don’t see it. \nI’ve always been stoic towards her (i don’t scream in her face when i’m mad or act overjoyed when i’m happy), that’s just how i am. And she’s always been moody.\n\nHowever i do think the relationship with my brother has changed, since she started putting me in a bad light. But i want your opinion, AITA?",

We’ve never had a decent interaction. She's always loud and surrounded by her group, always has something sarcastic to say about me. I mostly ignore it.\n\nAnyway, today as I was opening my umbrella, she ran up to me and said, “Hey, share kar lete hai, waise bhi jagah hai”\n[Translation: \"Hey, move a bit. There is space.\"]\n\nI just looked at her and said, “Sorry, it's small.” And walked away.\n\nI could literally hear her say “bitch” under her breath. Later, in class, some of her friends said I was “heartless” and “mean” for not sharing in an emergency.\n\nBut I’m sorry — I’m tired of being treated like garbage and then expected to be generous.

      "scenario_description": "I have a situation that may seem minor, but I’d still like an outside perspective. My fiancée (23F) and I (23M) deeply value communication and transparency, though we sometimes fall short. Her birthday is coming up in two and a half weeks, and today we had our first detailed conversation about it. Coincidentally, my summer vacation lands right before her birthday (for two weeks), and I planned to take her actual birthday off too.\n\nThe issue is a classic one: in-laws visiting. She let me know that her mother will be staying with us for five days (ending on her birthday), her father for three, and her grandparents for two. These plans were made without consulting me. I immediately felt “off” about it—not because I dislike her family (I love them and enjoy their company), but because of the length and lack of communication. I couldn’t help but view it hypocritically: in the past, she’s been very clear that my three siblings shouldn’t stay longer than three days. I understood and respected that boundary.\n\nI’m someone who struggles with mental health and needs space to recharge. The only people I can be around without stress are my fiancée and siblings. Her mom, while lovely, is high-energy and very ADHD—traits that often clash with my anxious and introverted nature. It’s not a matter of liking or disliking anyone; it’s about mental stamina.\n\nWhen I told her that five days felt long, she didn’t seem to acknowledge my feelings. I then expressed that I wished she had discussed it with me first. I said I’d prefer if her mom could stay for just three days. She replied that it wouldn’t be appropriate to change the plans now, as it would be rude to her mother. I brought up the precedent with my siblings—how we had communicated and compromised—but she said the situations weren’t comparable. Her view is that my siblings are teens/preteens who want to spend time with her, while her mom is there primarily for her. I agreed they aren’t identical, but still felt the broader point stood: extended houseguests increase stress, especially in our small home.\n\nThe conversation began to stall. I made one final plea to shorten her mom’s stay, and she said that since it’s her birthday, I should “meet her in the middle.” I pointed out that nothing had changed—there had been no compromise or middle ground—so I’d essentially just be ignoring my own needs. She reiterated that the plans were made and she wouldn’t change them. At that point, I felt frustrated and emotionally drained, and I went to another room to cool off and type this post.\n\nI realize this isn’t a massive issue—five days is not weeks or months—but I still feel frustrated, unseen, and confused. I’m open to being wrong here, or to having overlooked her perspective in the way I feel she overlooked mine. I just want some outside input on what feels like a trivial matter from the outside, but is a real source of emotional tension from where I’m sitting. Thank you.\n",

      "scenario_description": "Hello. I (f22) still live with my parents (f44, m52), as they need my support taking care of my little brother (6). He is a special needs kid, and while I do love and take care of him on a daily basis, I have to admit that he's quite a handful, as he doesn't verbally communicate and doesn't like to listen to adults.\n\n\nI'm a nurse, often working 12 or 24h shifts, which can be incredibly exhausting. This morning I came back from work at around 7:30am, when my mother asked me to care for my little brother while she went out. I said yes, saw my brother was still sleeping, and being dead tired I snuggled up to him and went to sleep myself. \n\n\nI woke up at noon, and that's when I noticed that he had trashed the whole house while I was snoozing. I'm taking chocolate on furniture, kitchen utensils in the couch cushions, toilet paper and other little things thrown about across the whole house. I got out of bed, found him, made some breakfast for him and me and set about cleaning the house. \n\n\nMy mother came back about half an hour later, while I was still busy cleaning, and she was livid. After cleaning the house, I went out for a smoke break, at which point she called me and cried over the phone about how she can't trust me anymore and that I was a bad sister for sleeping while he wrecked the house (we keep the front door always locked and all the dangerous chemicals out of reach, so he wasn't ever in any real danger). I told her that I couldn't keep my eyes open if I tried and hung up.\n\n\nNow, I feel like an ass because I probably should've told her so this morning, but I also think it wasn't that big of a deal—we cleaned the house up by about 3pm. So.. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I'm a biological female, 14 years old. My father, 37 years old, is divorcing my step mom of 10 years. \n\nAbout 2 months ago my father told me on my BIRTHDAY WEEKEND that he and my stop mom were getting a divorce. I was obviously upset(and still am)but it feels he's going WAY too fast with his new 'girlfriend.' \n\nI had recently gotten a job for the summer, and haven't had much time to see my father. So fourth of July week, I took it off to see HIM and my FAMILY. But I didn't expect to meet his new 'girlfriend' for the first time. Mind you, they've been dating for 2 months and my father has only JUST filed for divorce 3 MONTHS AGO.\n\nWhen he picked me up, it felt good to talk to my dad. I have had known about the woman he has been talking to for only a few weeks and I've been hurting for a while about the divorce, and I think that he just didn't care. I saw a message come through reading: \"___Baby girl.\" And I got really quiet, how could I not?\n\nOnce we got back to our new apartment that I haven't even SLEPT in yet, I brought her(the new girlfriend)up. I told him how I felt and that I wasn't ready to meet her yet, but he said, \"___ I'm adding value to our lives, ___.\" And I didn't know how to feel about it. We talked about it for a while, and I just gave up asking not to meet her. \n\nAnyways, about the fourth of July... my father had dropped me off at my grandparents house on a Wednesday. I wasn't very happy about it but I went along with it. So on fourth of July, that Friday, he had promised to see me and my cousin for a little, which I was excited about. But I had texted him when he was gonna see us, and he called me.\n\nHE WAS AT HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND'S FAMILY REUNION.\n\nHe PROMISED me and told my AUNT he'd come see HER too. HE told HER that.\n\nMy father and I were on the phone for about an hour, and I was PISSED. AITA for being so upset with him? Is it reasonable for me to be mad at him? Because I can't help but feel that he's replaced ME and OUR family with someone else's family. ",

Seems awfully quick to think he's so serious about the new person that he's already told you and wants you to meet her. A more skeptical person might infer that he has been seeing her since before the divorce. ",

      "scenario_description": "I feel so bad about this whole thing. Like I’m losing sleep over this. So I (F 19) am moving into an apartment soon with three other girls, so it’ll be four of us. Our room assignments came out recently and I got the room I wanted! It’s on the far left side, it has a long hallway to the entrance and I like that it’s kinda secluded. Either way I’m happy. \n\n\nIn comes. One roommate. In the gc I see she asked me “hey would you wanna switch rooms? I’m bringing my pet rabbit, he’s small, this is the cage “ ummmm what. I see the pic of the cage, it’s one that stays on the floor with no top so it can roam around, yeah it looks big. So I basically was like “ I’m really happy with the room I got but I hope it works out 😭” because I have trouble saying NO. I get stepped on all the time. Her room doesn’t even seem that different from mine. \n\nI don’t care about size, the main reason I am saying NO to her room is because the door exits right into the living room. Like um no. I’m a light sleeper and hate noise so I love the distance I have, like I’m just so happy with it! And now I feel so guilty! Anyways. She then private messages me. Um ok. She said “hey it’s just the cage is so big and I want space etc etc. “ she says her reasonings. Then I’m like… ummm what. So I say something not too mean but like more stern. I’m like “yeah sorry but I requested that room specifically I’m happy I got it, I just don’t want to be in a room I’m uncomfortable with.” \n\n\nthen… I get voice notes , her like “yeah o just also don’t like where the door is and my parents don’t either it’s like right at the front and they don’t like how unsafe that seems. Idk have u seen his cage? It’s just really big. Also me and (her friend who’s also living with us ) we reserved the room really early so idk why we didn’t get them.” I’m not sure if her or her friend got the room they wanted, on the end. They’re both a grade above us so idk what they thought we were gonna do. \n\nANYWAYS to her voice notes I said “oh yeah I didn’t like where the door was too when I picked it, that’s why I wanted room D (my room) so I’m sorry no and I already started buying stuff so I’ll feel bad to my parents yaknow.” Anyways I feel so mean after basically saying no four times and she replied once more like “yeah it’s just super annoying because like neither of us got the room we wanted and we did this really early “ idk. \n\nThe icing on top is she actually isn’t allowed the bring her bunny. But I’m no snitch. The apartment doesn’t allow it 😐 so like. Why is this my problem. I LIKE MY ROOM. And I know I’d hate it if I switched. And I’m no anxious because why is there now drama in my future apartment. I’m gonna feel so guilty in the room and nervous around her. But why would she put in that spot? Should I have just switched? But the door bro. I told her I didn’t want to be the “quiet down” roommate because I need quiet. Ugh. I hope her bunny gets caught so she isn’t allowed to have it anyways. Who brings that to college when you know you need space??? 😩 why am I the bad guy",

      "scenario_description": "My husband and I have been together for 12 years, married for 7. For the past year and a half, he’s been the sole caregiver for his mom, who has early dementia. He stepped up completely bathing her, dressing her, changing her, managing her meds, all of it. I work full time to support both of us so he could focus on her full time. It’s been emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausting especially for him.\n\nHe is one of six kids, and they all live within 30 minutes. Not a single one helped. Not once. It was just him and his dad, day in and day out, while the rest of the family ghosted.\n\nWell, her condition recently progressed and she had to be placed in a care home. Suddenly, everyone comes out of the woodwork like they’ve been involved this whole time. One sister-in-law made a big “family group chat” called “Sweet Mama D” and sent this dramatic message like:\n\n“Hey everyone! Mama D has been placed in a home, so let’s all continue being there for her! This is also a space to share memories and support each other!”\n\nExcuse me? Continue? Nobody but my husband and his dad have been there. What are y’all continuing exactly?\n\nAnd to make it worse I wasn’t even included in the group chat. But people from other states and even literal 13-year-old cousins were added. My husband knew I wasn’t in it but I said let’s just give it a few days. Well during those two days they continued adding others… just not me.\n\nAfter 2 days my husband added me, I immediately left the group. When asked why, I told them plainly “We gave it two days. Nobody thought to add me or even mention me. At this point, I don’t want to be in it.”\n\nNow I’m being told I’m “childish” and “making this about me,” but I’m sorry… I was there. Every single day. Supporting my husband while he broke down watching his mom lose herself. And now that she’s in a home, these people want to play loving family and post old photos like they’ve been in the trenches too?\n\nSo AITA for leaving the group chat and being over it? Or are they just mad because I didn’t pretend along with the group hug energy?\n\nEDIT: My husband and me were in bed sitting right next to each other when they group chat started and I was like “I didn’t get that message” he looked and was like of you didn’t get added. So I said let’s give it a few days because it’s a lot going on right now and after two days she added some more people and that’s when he added me. I was at work and saw I was added by him and left because I didn’t want to be in it at that point. My Sister in law made the chat and was the person adding everyone. Her husband is one of the siblings ",

It was bad like 🤮\n\nNext day we do new planing my older sister comes over to babysit I ask wife why she is not preparing she makes something up. Later she comes to me happy and ask if we bring along her sister and another sister. I say this time but it's not that I'm married to them so I don't get it only to understand they wanted me to pay the bil.\n\nAnd today i was taking care of the child to 13 o clock then wife's come home all happy I ask what it is and she ask if she can go with her sister to the beach 18 and leave me babysitting. I was done with her so to do whatever she wanted. Left home with wife as babysitter and went to dads place to chill, I called the only person I like my mother and she got pissed when I told all about her idee on wedding anniversary retry and how her older sister slammed the idee as soon she heard i didn't take it to kind to pay all of their meals, I also told her the reason she slammed is because it's bad time while mentioning how when they are out they come 1-2 o clock and when we were going it was 23:20 because wife waited.\nMom was pissed and told dad and dad didn't take to well with it so he called wife's dad\n (as my dad and her dad  are friends from old days) .\nAnd my dad called wife's mother and told her all about this mother-in-law was lied twords by wife's sister that told her she nursing hours as she is a practising nurse in her studies. \nWife blames me for her and her sister getting yelled at her father said \" your husband didn't come here for us but for you and his child and you, so if don't want spend time with say so and he fly back and work or study\"\n\nAITA?\n\n\nPs: just got to know she gave our child two nicknames that are of her sisters partners ",

      "scenario_description": "I (21 F) left my (26 M) cousin at our grandma's house a few hours ago. Since we were swimming, I had wanted to go to the store to get some items for the pool, as well as some other stuff I needed. I did not ask him or his sibling(20 NB)  to come with, but they decided to tag a long anyways. The older cousin, who we'll call J, complains about the distance of the store. The entire time we were in the store J is telling me to hurry up and complain that I'm even taking the time to browse items. The younger cousin, D told me it was okay and that they weren't bothered by being there. \n\n I know I over reacted on this part, I'm on my period, he's visibly grating my nerves and making me feel like shit for pulling him away from good times even though I didn't even ask either of them to be there. The entire ride back I was silent, and once we got there I noticed their father was still in the drive way, so I told them I was planning on heading home, and that I'd be willing to take them home now or they could just go home with their dad. \n\nJ asks if it was because they went with me, and I admitted that yeah I was a bit annoyed by that, but mostly I was probably getting overly emotional because of my hormones. I had hoped being honest would alleviate the tension, because it wasn't like they couldn't tell I was visibly annoyed. \n\nThey both agreed to stay there, and while J was annoyed I was leaving, didn't seem all that annoyed to be left there. D was especially caring as I left, which I assumed was because getting emotionally overwhelmed was something they related to. After I left I ended up messaging D saying \"I don't really know what he expected lmao.\" Because I really didn't, If I gave that same energy back to him he wouldn't have stayed either, or at least he would have given me a lot of shit for it. \n\nD snapped on me roughly an hour later, telling me that being on my period wasn't an excuse to abandon people at places they don't want to be at(for context, J doesn't really like our grandmother or his father, but they chose to go to my grandma's, and they live with their dad.) \n\nHonestly I thought I was pretty transparent, the vibe was pretty much ruined for me, my mood completely crashed, and I gave them some options that they accepted. I apologized for leaving them, because I would infact have taken them home, or even just given them Lyft money if they wanted to stay later and not go with their dad. Personally I think I did my best on my end to communicate what I was feeling and why I wanted to bail, and I don't think I got that back. \n\nTldr; I left my cousins at our grandma's house because I was annoyed with them, their dad was their to take them home, but they also don't like him.

A group of my son’s friends are going away and when I told him that I booked it, he immediately said “I can’t take off, is everyone going?” At the time maybe two or three of the fathers weren’t going because they had to work, so he said ok, I can’t take off, have fun. Fast forward to a week before the trip  and I find out that in fact those fathers took off and are going. I didn’t say anything to my husband because I know he wouldn’t have taken off work with a week to go. He finds out and is now irate with me for not telling him that “everyone” is going and he’s now not and that I didn’t give him the option and have a conversation with him. His reason is “do you know how this makes me look?” We got into a huge argument and I told him if he wanted to have gone it should have been because he wanted to take a family trip and not because everyone is going.

      "scenario_description": "My sister and I are on vacation with our mom for the 4th of July, staying at a beautiful beachside resort. Unfortunately, my mom woke up sick that morning. My sister and I immediately went to the store and got her cold medicine, vitamin C, Zicam, chicken noodle soup, ice cream, and other thoughtful comfort items.\n\nAll throughout the day, I was checking in on her, asking if she needed anything, trying to get her to come outside, or at least sit with us on the patio or beach. It’s not like I wasn’t thinking about her…she was constantly on my mind. I genuinely cared and wanted her to feel included or at least a little better. But her responses were vague or dismissive, and she chose to stay inside and rest.\n\nAt the same time, we didn’t want to spend the entire day cooped up inside watching her sleep, especially when she wasn’t asking us to do anything specific. We spent most of the day at the beach just steps away, trying to enjoy a bit of the holiday. It was a tough emotional balance: wanting to enjoy the moment but also worrying about her.\n\nThat evening, I picked up a plain burger from a cute local place she usually would’ve loved, because that’s what she said she wanted. They didn’t have ketchup packets and I didn’t grab any…same as with my own fries. But when we brought it back, she looked at it and just said, “I can’t eat this,” and got really upset. That moment led to a big blow-up between the three of us.\n\nShe said later that it wasn’t about me, it was just because she was sad she was sick. But in the moment, it felt like I was being blamed for not being there enough or for being selfish for enjoying the day without her. It really hurt. I tried so hard to balance taking care of her with enjoying a rare vacation, and I walked away feeling like nothing I did mattered.\n\nTo add to it, we opened a bottle of wine we had bought together at a winery earlier in the week. We had planned to drink it during the trip, but figured she wouldn’t want any since she wasn’t feeling well. We even asked her if she wanted some and she said no and she even laughed a little while my sister struggled to open the champagne-style bottle. But later, she made comments that made us feel like we were being inconsiderate for drinking it without her.\n\nWe’re all adults, but sometimes I feel like I’m in the weird position of being the “parent” in these situations (managing feelings, trying to keep peace, anticipating everyone’s needs) It’s exhausting.\n\nNow I just feel sad. What should have been a happy memory feels like emotional trauma. I cared deeply, and I really tried..but somehow it all turned into guilt and hurt.\n\nSo… AITA for trying to enjoy the 4th of July while my mom was sick, even though I tried really hard to take care of her and include her?",

      "scenario_description": "My partner (28F) and I (25F) have been together for a while and worked hard to build a calm, independent life for ourselves. We both came from rocky family backgrounds, but have created a soft, stable life—filled with communication, compassion, and just… peace.\n\nRecently, her younger sister (19F) came to us for help. She has a lot of unresolved mental health issues that she refuses to address. She’s not working, doesn’t have a high school diploma, and is currently on social assistance. She had been living with their emotionally abusive father but got them kicked out of their last apartment after mouthing off to the landlord. (She had reason to be upset, but the way she handled it escalated things unnecessarily.)\n\nShe reached out to us because she needed help finding housing in the city and wasn’t sure if social assistance would cover rent. We agreed to help. We found her a place, paid her first month’s rent and damage deposit, bought her some groceries and essentials, and even gave her a bunch of stuff from around our house to help her get started. We also agreed to cover any financial gaps that she had until she found a job, paying for her groceries or her bills that she couldn’t afford. \n\nBefore moving into her new place, we let her stay with us for a few days. The only condition was that while we were away on vacation (5 days), she would take care of our three cats and keep the place reasonably tidy. We sent her clear messages about what was expected, including reminders during our trip.\n\nWhen we got home, the house was disgusting. The cat litter hadn’t been touched, the kitchen was a mess, and the house smelled. I had to clean the kitchen before I could make supper for the three of us. My partner dealt with the cat litter.\n\nLater, my partner gently brought it up with her. She reminded her that we were doing her a favor, and that not taking care of the house was disrespectful. Her sister completely lost it—screaming at us, calling us bitches, saying we were OCD (we’re not, our house is just normally clean but lived-in), and telling us we were on some kind of high horse and didn’t care about her.\n\nShe then started crying and yelling more. We told her that if she was going to continue behaving that way, she needed to leave. She stormed outside and sat on the front steps, calling everyone she knew and telling them we kicked her out.\n\nFor me, it’s not about the state of the house (although it was gross). It’s about the repeated disrespect. Every time she’s around, she’s yelling, angry, or emotionally explosive toward my partner. I’ve reached my limit.\n\nSo, AITA for telling her to leave and not tolerating this behavior in our home anymore?",

      "scenario_description": "I (20F) live in student halls where all parcels go to the reception and need to be picked up promptly. I once got told off by the receptionist for not picking mine up within a few days (I was sick at the time and hadn't left my room), and ever since then, she’s given me dirty looks.\n\nBecause of this, I’m very careful about collecting my parcels on time—and I’ve told my friend Nancy (22F) about this. She occasionally sends her packages to my place because it’s safer than her own, and I’ve always been okay with it *as* long *as* she picks them up quickly. The issue is, she never does. I always have to remind her, and one time, her package sat in my tiny room for over a week. (Note: my room has almost no storage space, which is why I prefer things to stay at reception until picked up.)\n\nNancy lives about an 8-minute walk from me, so it’s not like she has to travel far.\n\nLast Wednesday, she asked again to send something to my address. I said okay, but reminded her (again) to pick it up ASAP. On Saturday, I happened to be running errands near her place, so I offered to drop it off. She said she was too lazy to get out of bed and open the door (she lives on the 4th floor, no elevator). She told me to text her if I would be free later that day, but I already told her then that I would most likely not be.)\n\nOn Monday, she asked to come pick it up Tuesday. I said yes. Then Tuesday evening, she canceled and said she’d come Wednesday instead. That’s when I got frustrated and reminded her she had told me “not to worry.” She gave excuses like being \"naked in bed\" and that I couldn't expect for her to \"drop everything in such a short notice\" on that whole Saturday situation. (I told her I would be there in 40mins, which I think its plenty of time to just put clothes on, walk down and open her front door). She also pointed out that I \"didn't text her so she assumed I was busy\". (I am of the opinion that she should be the one checking when I'm free, not the other way around). I told her all of this (), and that I wasn’t trying to argue, just holding her to what she promised.\n\nShe kept making more excuses, including that she expected me to bring it on Friday (we’d talked loosely about hanging out with our other friends, but I never confirmed I’d be there, and she never asked me to bring the parcel anyway). She also said she has been really busy and picking up the package wasn't a priority. So I asked why she had it sent to me if she knew she’d be too busy to collect it and if she knew how particular I am about quick pickups.\n\nI ended up telling her I’m not her assistant and that I found her behavior disrespectful. I do get irritated easily, but this was the first time I’ve been this blunt and direct with her.\n\nAITA?\n\nI would also like advice on how to proceed from here. Also, she mentioned before that the package was just vitamins and ngl I feel like sticking them in the microwave to ruins its efficacy. (It's not any serious medication, just vit B and magnesium - she told me she got them because \"smart people r taking brain supplements\". Is that too much?",

We live in the area so we weren't renting a cabin, just there for dinner.\n \n&nbsp;\n \nThey have a gender neutral single stall bathroom that locks, the kind that only one person can use at a time. My gf and I have been dating for nearly 6 years, so we obviously are not concerned about privacy. We both had to use the bathroom and we went in there together. This is not the first time we've done this at other places with similar style bathrooms. I used it first while she touched up her make up, then she used it. We washed up and left. Had to have been less than 5 mins in and out. Probably around 3 or 4 mins max. \n\n&nbsp;\n \nWhen we exited, there was a mother waiting with two young kids that appeared to be waiting for the bathroom. As soon as she saw us both exit, she shot daggers at us and scoffed like she was utterly appalled by us. She said something to her kids to the effect of \"we can't use this bathroom, come on, we'll have to find another one\" and apparently said to my gf \"you two should be disgusted, this is a family resort\" verbatim. \n\n&nbsp;\n \nIt's obvious she assumed we were in there banging, but we absolutely were not. To me this is completely normalized and akin to our morning routines. Are we assholes for using the bathroom at the same time?",

That's gross!\n\nMe: But it's still food...\n\nMom: Just put it in the refrigerator \n\nI think the situation is pretty dumb overall, but I need other people's opinions because I kinda feel like the asshole in the situation\n\nEdit: she's pescatarian, thank you for the commenter that corrected that! And thanks for the support\n\nEdit 2 & small update: We're in the USA, and she was able to fix herself a plate if she wanted to. But usually she chooses not to, probably due to her work. Also I ate the fish for lunch because she wouldn't, also due to this rule I probably would've had to skip breakfast entirely",

I asked my usual friends but they couldn’t come so I turned to Amy. Me and Amy were only friends for a couple of weeks, but I asked her anyway she said sure the day of the sleepover she came over and it was okay. my parents let us have a drink and she acted like she got really drunk off half a drink which kind of gave me a red flag. She also kept calling boys and acting stupid with them which also was a red flag later that night we decided to go on Omegle which I wasn’t that comfortable with as I have a history with Omegle. That isn’t very good. I told her this but she still wanted to go on it so we went on there and it was okay until my parents came home and I said let’s hop off it because my parents don’t like Omegle. We were in bed watching a movie. She was laying next to me when she grabbed my laptop and went back on Omegle. She was talking to this guy. I was highly uncomfortable and didn’t have my face in the frame. She kept trying to move the camera so that my face was in it after about an hour of Omegle and talking to this one dude they added each other on snap she then went onto her bed and FaceTime him on Snapchat where he was making fun of me for being ugly and overweight instead of defending me she said “don’t say that she’s cripple” (I use a wheelchair) after about three hours of calling on snap he kept asking her to flash him. She said no then he asked me. I said no then he “said it’s cause you’re too ugly no one would even want to see them anyways” Amy then said i dare you to flash someone on Omegle I said no she then stole my laptop went on Omegle and peer pressured me to flash someone I pretended to but I didn’t really. I then went to bed. She stayed on the phone until 4 am playing with this weird dude talking about I’ll do this and I’ll flash you if you pay me $20 I’ll flash you and it was all really weird . The next morning she kept going on about how whatever happened at the sleepover stayed at the sleepover. I was highly uncomfortable and wanted her to leave my house but said sure the next school day on the bus ride home she told a bunch of boys that I’m not friends with a completely different story about how I made her get drunk and then flashed all these dudes on Omegle she still doesn’t know that I know that she told people.",

Again, I politely declined. \n\nMy friend took me aside later and told me I had upset granny and was selfish for not eating the fruit salad despite my allergy since it wouldn't kill me.

After me is another sister who is staying at my parents with *her* pair of wild boys. After that is the rest of my 6 brothers. One of which is getting married in a few days.\n\nThis is necessary information because in our family, the girls are treated like royalty. Growing up as the oldest boy in the family, I had a lot of responsibility on my shoulders and now that we are older, my parents and siblings all have grown to rely on me and my wife for a lot.\n\nMy wife even noted that my mom treats her more like a daughter than she does to my sisters in the sense that they are treated as princesses and don't know how to do anything. I absolutely can't stand it and do not let it slide when I'm there but they just ask me instead anyway.\n\nMy sisters don't really parent their own sons very well. Especially now that theyre here with \"free babysitters\" as they call it. They even joke that they're here to be \"daughter's, not mom's\". Thankfully, the one that is staying with me has the more older and better behaved kids but my other sister... they are the most ill mannered kids I've ever seen. \n\nTwo nights ago, my sister was having a hard night with her 5 month old and slept in the morning. Which was fine. My wife got the rest of the kids settled for breakfast while I slept in because I had only gotten back hours before from my night shift.\n\nMy wife put on a cartoon and left for work. I was woken up by the 5 year old screaming \"I pooped! Mooom! I'm pooping!! Mommy, I did a poop!\" I waited for 10 minutes before getting up and telling my sister *who was awake on her phone not sleeping*. She just grunted and was like \"can you wipe his butt?\" \n\nI blinked at her. 1st of all, I believe a 5 year old should be capable of wiping his own butt... but 2nd I AM NOT WIPING YOUR CHILDS BUTT. So I just said \"hell no\" and went back to bed. \n\nMy mom and sisters are pissed with me now. My mom told me that I need to be more nicer to my sister and that she needs help.

I didn't want a gender reveal party, but I still wanted to be able to tell everyone on my own terms. \n  She didn't care for my answer and told everyone in our church (we have a VERY small town/community) the gender this morning when I wasn't around.  Church members just began walking to me saying congratulations on baby's gender!  My sister saw I was obviously distraught and told my grandma to stop telling people which upset her more.  \n  Now I feel I can no longer share information about my baby without her going behind my back and telling everyone every little detail.

      "scenario_description": "My (32M) family has been planning a big vacation for over a year. It's me, my wife, our two kids (5 and 7), my parents, and my sister \"Anna\" (29F). We decided to rent a huge, high-end beach house in a popular tourist spot for a week. The total cost for the house was about $7,000, which we agreed to split five ways between the adults (me, my wife, my parents, and Anna), so $1400 per person.\n\nAnna was excited and paid her share of the deposit ($700) last year. The final balance was due two months ago, and she paid that too. Everything was set.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, Anna started having severe abdominal pain. After a few doctor visits, she was diagnosed with a pretty serious condition that required surgery. The surgery was scheduled for last Thursday, right in the middle of our vacation week. Obviously, she couldn't come. She was really upset about it, crying on the phone about missing the trip and being worried about the surgery. We all told her not to worry and just focus on her health.\n\nHer surgery went well, and she's now recovering.\n\nThe vacation was great, but obviously, Anna wasn't there. Her empty room was a bit of a downer, but we made the best of it.\n\nHere's where I might be the AH. Yesterday, I called Anna to see how she was feeling. We were chatting, and I brought up the vacation finances. I told her that since the house was non-refundable and her spot was already paid for, we still considered that her \"share.\" I said something like, \"Hey, glad you're recovering! Just wanted to square up on the vacation stuff. Since we couldn't get a refund for your spot, we're all square on the $1400 for the house.\"\n\nHer answer was \"Are you serious? You want me to pay for a vacation I couldn't go on because I was in the hospital having surgery?\"\n\nI explained that it wasn't about wanting her to pay, it's that her share was already locked in. We all paid the same amount. It wouldn't be fair for the rest of us to have to absorb her cost just because she had a personal issue come up, even a medical one. I told her that's what travel insurance is for, and it wasn't my fault she didn't get any.\n\nShe got really emotional and started crying, saying that she can't believe I'd bring this up while she's in pain and can barely walk. She called me a heartless ghoul and hung up.\n\nNow my parents are calling me, saying I was incredibly insensitive and that the family should have just eaten the cost. My mom said she's your sister not a business partner. But I see it as a matter of principle. We all made a financial commitment. If my car had broken down on the way and I'd missed half the trip, I wouldn't expect a refund from everyone else.\n\nMy wife is on my side, saying it's fair, but my parents and now Anna are treating me like I'm some kind of monster. I was just trying to be fair and logical about the money.",

      "scenario_description": "My dad owns two houses: the one he lives in, and one left to him by his grandparents. My older sister “Carrie” (F26) and I (F24) rent the other house. We’ve lived there for almost 2 years. \n\nA few months ago, my sister and I (with our parents permission) asked one of our cousins “Mary” (F24) to move in as we have an extra room. Mary was going through a hard time and had just gotten divorced and had no place to stay. She moved in shortly after. All three of us pay an equal amount of rent. \n\nShortly after Mary moved in, she started essentially harassing my sister and I, trying to get us to go to church with her, as she is a devout evangelical christian. She would try to guilt trip us and make comments anytime we did something “sinful”, and even though we asked her to stop multiple times, she didn’t. \n\nIt eventually got so bad that my sister and I told Mary that if she didn’t stop bringing up religion completely, we were going to have to ask her to find somewhere else to live as she was creating a hostile environment. \n\nMary told her dad that we “threatened her” and her dad told my mom, who said we were not allowed to kick Mary out as she is family and “just wants what is best” for us. \n\nMary got even WORSE after this, and Carrie and I began to notice that she was throwing away our stuff that she thought was “demonic” which is what pushed us over the edge. \n\nCarrie and I secretly looked for somewhere else to live, and we ended up finding a new place that we can actually buy. We decided to do it, and broke the news to Mary, as we will be leaving in about 2 weeks. \n\nMary FREAKED the fuck out since she can’t afford to rent the house on her own, and told our parents. My dad says we’re allowed to do what we want, but my mom is super angry, saying we are leaving Mary to live on the street, and a bunch of bs about how we’ve let the devil get to us. \n\nAre me and my sister assholes? I feel a little bad for Mary but also feel like she deserves it. ",

      "scenario_description": "# AITAH for Being Upset with my Parents' Minister about the Memorial Service Planning\n\nMy mother recently passed away, she was on hospice and it was expected. Several of us family members were able to be with her for a couple of weeks before and when she passed. None of us live locally to her or my father.\n\nWe reached out via text to their family minister about a week before she died to set a Memorial Service date and settled on one roughly 8 weeks away from the agreed date. That way family would have time to make arrangments to come back. My sibling, father, and I attended the church of the minister 3 days after her passing and confirmed the date again along with the time of 2pm for the service. It was done verbally that time.\n\nFast-forward a few weeks later, it seems the minister did not write the date or time down and upon reaching out to make detailed arrangements for the service itself, found out there is a baby shower scheduled in the church hall for the same day. The shower ends at 1pm and we agreed to push our service back to 3:00pm. We did not want to push it back further because we were planning to also go do my mother's favorite hike in a national park before dark after the memorial service and it involves quite a bit of driving.\n\nAfter we agreed to the 3pm time, apparently the mother of the soon-to-be-mom (shockingly throwing a shower for her OWN daughter!?!) had phoned the minister and was very stressed with the time frame of having to be cleaned up and out by roughly 2:30pm. The minister emailed us about this call and said that the shower is apparently a \"big deal\" and asked if we had to do the memorial service that day or what the latest time we could do it was because he didn't want to \"steal her joy\".\n\nI found this email to be very callous for us who are grieving, considering that we had planned the date and time 4 weeks prior. Also, what kind of extravagant shower at a church needs more than 1.5 hours to clean up from? The hall must be passed through to get into the church sanctuary, so there is no way to have an overlap.\n\nAMTAH for thinking the minister was out of line and rude in asking us if we had to do it that day or what the latest time is we could have it? (We had already mentioned we were doing the hike following the service, so he already knew when he asked.) My father and sibling are the same religion, but I am different and they both think I am being a jerk for being upset.  What do you think?  ",

      "scenario_description": "My(18) aunt and uncle(dad’s older brother) have been looking after me since I was 12(mom and dad have drug issues). I live with them and their 13 yr old daughter ‘Isabel.’\n\nThey are quite worried about her right now. The teachers said that she’s reading above her age level in our language but not doing so well in English. That’s why my uncle told me to help her with her English, knowing I used to really struggle with the language too.\n\nAnd I’m happy to help. Both him and my aunt have done a lot for me.\n\nI cut my teeth on the Goosebumps books. So that’s where I decided to start. I handed her one of them(My Friend Slappy) as a test, telling her to read the first couple of chapters and give summaries. She is finding them surprisingly enjoyable and has been steadily reading through the books as practice/to pick up vocabulary in between our exercises. But my uncle said at her age she should be reading more challenging stuff.\n\nI told him it might be better to take it slow but he said I’m not trying hard enough.\n\n",

He starts off my knocking on my door super aggressively which I already don't like, then I proceed to look on my ring camera and see he's shirtless. I decided to go on my ring to see what he wants as I dont feel safe opening the door. He proceeds to tell me our neighborhood has been flagged for high power usage and they are trying to save people money. I tell him I'm not intrested. Then he says its not an option to not be intrested and that he has paperwork with my information on it that he cant leave at the the door. I tell again im not intrested, I'm not opening the door, and if he wants he could leave the paper at the door or leave. Keep in mind I've told im not intrested at least 5 times already. I stop answering cuz he obviously doesn't know when to quit. Then he proceeds to tell me that he's just trying to do his job, I'm not treating him like a human being and i'm being extremely rude. He then tells me he'll be back in 3 hours cuz he has to give me the paper. AITA for not opening the door? I answered through the ring, I could have just ignored him completely but I didn't. \n\nThanks for all the replies. I try to be nice to everyone. Sometimes, it's at my own detriment. I usually open the door for solicitors. I dont mind talking to them, but this guy in particular just gave me weird vibes. The fact that he called me out for being rude made me feel some type of way, like maybe I was being an asshole for telling him to leave and not wanting to open the door. However, you guys are right.

I learned it at school as a child but I also watched a lot of American TV shows and listened to music so it was kind of easy to imitate the words being said. At some point I felt like I was happy with my progress and confident enough to speak anywhere. \n\nA few days ago, I met a few people from the US (19-21 year olds) and and one of them told me it was weird for me to speak with an accent and use words typically related to american slang like “ain’t” and “y’all” and others like those ( just a disclaimer I don’t use any bad words or anything and I’m familiar with any terms that I’m not supposed to say so it wasn’t about this. Like I know very well what I must avoid saying, I have been chronically online for ages). Anyways basically no one really disagreed with him and I felt pretty embarrassed. I guess I seemed like some wannabe so I get why they might be uncomfortable even though a few of them had praised me before so I wasn’t checking myself while I talked. I get it but also can’t help but feel like it’s unfair.\n\nI’m kind of uncomfortable about myself now because I feel like I may need to learn english again and I’m also unsure how I could take out regular words from my vocabulary because I speak without thinking too much. Yesterday, I got invited again to hangout with everyone but I’m still feeling pretty down. WIBTA if I continued to speak this way? I’m so confused because for me if someone spoke my language (which has many accents) in my accent I would be happy but I fully understand if this is not the case for others. I just want some fresh perspective because I kind of feel like I’m not being given grace but at the same time I don’t want to offend anybody by acting entitled or something..",
