      "post_title": "AITA for not bringing gifts to my nephews’ birthdays because they never give my kids anything?",
      "scenario_description": "I (34F) have two kids. Over the past few years, my nephews have had several birthday parties. We’ve always been invited, and I used to bring gifts every time. But I started noticing that when it’s my kids’ birthdays, their parents never bring anything, or even acknowledge it. My kids don’t even get a “happy birthday” from them.\n\nIt’s started to feel very one-sided. Their parents (my brother and sister-in-law) are often cold and dismissive toward me and my kids. So this year, I decided I wasn’t going to keep doing something for people who clearly don’t return the effort. I still went to the party — but didn’t bring any gifts.\n\nAfter the party, I got a bunch of texts saying I was being petty and “you don’t punish kids for adult problems.” Now I’m starting to wonder if I was in the wrong, and maybe I should’ve separated the kids from how I feel about their parents. AITA for not bringing any gifts?\n\n**Edit:** For those asking — yes, we’ve always had birthday parties for my kids, and my brother, sister-in-law, and their children were invited every time. They attended a few over the years but never brought gifts or really acknowledged the occasion.\n\nAlso, for clarification: it wasn’t even my brother or SIL who texted me after the party — it was my parents. So clearly, someone complained to them behind the scenes. Kind of ironic that no one said a word when my kids were the ones being overlooked for years, but the moment I stop bringing gifts, *that’s* when it’s a problem.",

They don't bother to give your kids birthday presents, even when they attend the party.   \nWhy would they expect you to continue giving their kids gifts when they have been neglecting your kids? They are the ones who \"brought the kids\" into whatever the issues are.  \nYou don't say how old the kids are but please, don't back down!! They will appreciate you standing up for them. I speak from experience. I had an uncle who showed up once a year with his 2 kids, Christmas morning. Never a gift for us but they left with cash envelopes every time. I could not make my parents understand how very hurtful it was that we weren't worth even a card and a box of candy but they left with their yearly cash handout. I always felt like they were saying it was OK to treat us like crap, they still got their take.   \nAnyway, regardless of what anyone says, the message needs to be that you have your kids backs!! It's not OK to ignore their birthdays expect you to keep giving to your brother's kids.",

She often expresses disapproval of my cousin(16)’s preference, referring to her romance novels as ‘literary McDonalds.’ Tells her they ‘don’t teach us anything about society.’ At one point she brought me up in one of their arguments, telling her she has to read ‘meaningful classics’ if she wants to get into a good university like mine.\n\nI didn’t want to say much since it already feels like I’m imposing/inconveniencing her. So I only told my aunt that I read romance too and those books helped me build up my vocabulary and do well enough on the exams I had to take to gain admission. Not to mention they helped with decompressing.\n\nShe dismissed this. My cousin said I could have said more to help her out instead of letting her get castigated like that.",

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "Background: My (31F) parents live overseas. They visit at least twice a year - one of those times being at Christmas.  While here, they stay with me an my husband (M31) and our 3 young kids. We love having them stay. \n\nToday however I got a call from my mum saying their friend ‘George’ (in his mid 20s I think) who is from their church (who they have known for a few years now says he thinks of them as second parents now) wants to visit Canada and stay at our house along with my parents for Christmas. My mum said they’d spoken about him visiting Canada in the past but she imagined this would happen when they had moved back here and had their own place - so always said she liked the idea. \n\nGeorge went to dinner at my parents house yesterday and brought up coming to Canada this Christmas, to stay with them at our house  and my mum didn’t have the heart to say no. She asked if this would be okay with us?\n\nMy husband and I have never met George and am due to have my 4 baby in a few months and it’s our year to host Christmas for our extended family - so Christmas is already going to be a bit hectic. \n\nI just don’t love the idea of someone I don’t know staying in our house and being around our family and tagging along and joining all our family traditions. Nothing specifically against George - I’m sure he is nice enough if my parents think so.\n\nSpace wise - we do have have a study that my husband uses to work from home. However my husband will still need to work some days before / after Christmas and I don’t know what kind of dates George is thinking of staying. \n\nI told my mum while I don’t really want George to stay here but if he gets his own accomodation - he can come for lunch at Christmas with the rest of the extended family. My mum was nice about it but I could tell she was a bit disappointed / sad and mentioned the trip would become a lot more expensive for him so he might not be able to do it. I can tell she felt awkward to have to tell him he can’t stay here.\n\nFor context my parents have always been people to open their home when others need it so I feel a bit bad saying no and now making my mum have to pass the message along. \n\nI think most people in my position would have said no but I do feel a bit bad so just wanting to know AITA here? Should I have thought about it more before giving an answer - I don’t think I’d change my mind though.",

This is about as rude as it gets. You have no reason to accommodate this stranger by opening your home to him.  \nHe may have \"family\" relationship with your parents but you've never even met him!! I actually suspect that your parents invited him and are trying to avoid being told that they had no right.  \nRegardless, I sure as hell wouldn't be having a stranger staying in my home with my small children! You don't know him or anything about him. Have your parents lost their fucking minds??",

      "scenario_description": "Attended Post Malone’s Big Ass Tour concert at T-mobile arena in Seattle last night. Woman behind us thought she needed to stand and sing along to every song. Problem was she is tone deaf and can’t sing a lick. She was basically screaming/yelling during every song. She did seem to know the words to all the songs so I give her credit for that. I’m sure she’s a top notch shower singer but tonight was definitely not her night. It was extremely painful and she was ruining the experience for all within shouting distance. I finally turned around and explained to her that while I appreciated her enthusiastic effort to sing along, I actually paid to listen to Jelly roll and Posty sing, not her. Maybe she could just sing along in her head? Well…as you can imagine, she didn’t appreciate my constructive criticism and proceeded to lose her damn mind. I was informed that she spent over $500 on her tickets, was a single mother of three, and deserved to do whatever she wanted because tonight was her night. So I dropped the hammer and told her that she was 100% tone deaf, her voice was awful and she needed to accept the fact that she just can’t sing. While yelling the  words in a monotone voice might be exhilarating and empowering, it was pure torture for the rest of us. I suggested that I really didn’t want to ruin her fun, yet she needs to be considerate of others. Maybe a muzzle next time? She could still enjoy the thrilling rush of belting out every song word for word, and save her neighbors the unrelenting agony? I know concerts are supposed to be to be a time to let your hair down and get a little rowdy. But this was just too much. I don’t know, was I being a Karen? (even though I’m a dude) Should I have just kept my mouth shut and endured in silence? Give me the truth. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (26 M) and my fiancée (28 F) are set to get married within the next year, while we were making our invitations we came across an issue, one of her friends we will call her Emily, has the worst boyfriend in the world. He’s insanely rude, a complete misogynist, and all around deadbeat. In the first year of our relationship Emily would call us all the time complaining about (we will call him Rick) saying that he would stalk her at every bar, and do a bunch of weird shit, and almost like an African wild dog (they hunt by wearing down their prey), eventually I guess he wore her out until they started dating??? ANYWAYS in that time I said A LOT of things about Rick before they went out together, which has even caused that Emily excludes me from all events involving my fiancées friend group, it’s never been confirmed but I’m sure it has to do with my well known hatred of Rick.\n\nAnyways things came to a head when making the invitations, I said that absolutely he’s not coming to our wedding, and that I didn’t care, which then prompted my fiancée to be panicking due to her friend groups dynamic. She told me that if this were to go through it would cause Emily to not come at all which would potentially cause even more drama with her friend group which would lead to potentially to a situation that would ruin the wedding.\n\nFor context, everyone hates Rick all her friends do but they don’t tell her that to Emily’s face, Rick was found to have compiled suggestive pictures of some of Emily’s friends in a file in his phone, people gave restraining orders against that man, he humiliates Emily publicly for amusement, and constantly argues with other people in that friend group. He makes women uncomfortable and my entire family is only women, and my 2 daughters.\n\nThe last thing I would want is for my fiancée to feel uneasy at her own wedding but I don’t feel comfortable having Rick around.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting Rick at my wedding?\n\n(Adding detail, her friends aren’t the ones with retraining orders, and yes the explicit pictures were nudes he had collected via a local Reddit thread he made to obtain them from their exes, also African wild dogs hunt by wearing down their prey I had not realized how it looked until someone pointed it out! My bad sincerely!)",

Sit down with Emily and tell her that like many decisions with your partner, your guest list is a   \n\"2 yes/1 no\". In spite of your fiancé's attempts to persuade you, you are a firm no when it comes to inviting Rick to the wedding. Tell Emily that you are hoping that she won't hold your decision against her (your fiancé) because she's not the one responsible.  \nSince Emily makes it a point to exclude you, I can't imagine why she would expect you to invite Rick to your wedding anyway. I also don't know why the \"friend group\" is more important than your feelings.   \nIf your wife-to-be has accepted your exclusion and continues to maintain this group as \"her people\" you have some real issues to settle before sending out any invitations at all!!",

I lost my temper, called her a bitch, and ran off crying.\n\nTo make matters worse, my dad and brothers seem to think I'm being unreasonable and that I should just \"toughen up\" and deal with it.

My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we \"let\" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying \"no\" to the waitress because her family should've \"taken care of her\" (her words, not mine). \n\nThe three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.

      "scenario_description": "My daughter is 13 and she goes to a small school. Her grade only has 18 students (10 boys and 8 girls). My daughter also has other friends from the sports she does. We plan to have her go to a much larger high school in the future. Her 13th birthday party was last weekend and I asked who she wanted to invite, she wanted to invite 7 of the girls from her class and 5 from her soccer team. The one girl she doesn't want to invite is name Kelly.\n\nMy daughter doesn't like Kelly, she is the class clown in her grade and my daughter hides her annoying and attention seeking. I asked her why she didn't want her there and her response was \"she ruins school for me all the time, I don't want her to ruin my birthday.\" I agreed with her list and sent the invites out.\n\nMy ex-wife is invited to all her major milestone instead of us doing separate events. I learned an hour beofre the party my ex-wife sent an invte to Kelly since her mom found out about the party. My daughter was not happy to see her (it was a suprise for her), I told her to enjoy the party.\n\nIt was going well until the cake came out, my daughter wanted a glitter cake (when you blow out the candles glitter goes everywhere). While everyone was around the cake, Kelly took her fingers and swiped icing off the top layer of the cake. It ruined the cake and my daughter lost it. She yelled at Kelly, basically saying, \" what is wrong with you, this is why I didn't want you her and that you ruin everything.\" She ran to her room after and Kelly was crying.\n\nKelly's parent is wanting an apolgy, my ex-wife wants her to apoligze as well. I am refusing to make her do that or punish her at all. I pointed out that my ex never should have invited her and to the mom that her child ruined the cake, and that at 12 years old should know better. They are calling me an ass and my daughter is just upset.,",

Mom is the sole reason that Kelly was there and in a position to do her damage.   \nAs sad as it is that Kelly was the only one to be excluded, it's obvious that your daughter had very legitimate reasons for not wanting her there. She was true to form and ruined your daughter's party.  \nI think that you should be brutally blunt with Kelly's mother. She is obviously aware that her daughter was not on the initial guest list. You need to tell her that Kelly's unacceptable behavior is precisely why your daughter didn't want her there and didn't invite her. She was invited without your daughter's knowledge, and as it turned out she only reinforced your daughter's good judgment!! Now everyone knows why she wasn't invited!!  \nGood advice would probably be not to go where you're not wanted.",

      "post_title": "AITA for locking myself in my office when we have company?",
      "scenario_description": "I 36 F took in my mother during the pandemic after some medical issues. I never made her move out after, It works for us, she has her own bedroom and bathroom, we share other spaces and I work from home most of the time so I can look after her. My stepdad died about a decade ago and she was lonely. It made sense for us.\n\nAs mentioned I work from home most of the time and a lot of times i'm in some kind of teams meeting or call (yes even those that could be emails but thats not important). So I don't really have time for chitchat during office hours. My mom's sister aka my aunt tends to drop by unannounced to visit with my mom. Which I don't really mind, but she had a tendancy  to step into my office without knocking while i'm working and start talking to me about her neighbors sisters kid who did bla bla bla. I've more than once explained to her that I'm working and or I'm on a call and I can't really chat right now. But she just keeps talking like nothing happened.\n\nToday she actually announced to my mom she was coming over. I reminded my mom to tell her I'm working and on calls and can't be disturbed and my mom agreed she would tell her not to bother me. But just to be safe I locked my office door so she couldn't walk in.\n\nDespite my mom telling her, she came upstairs and tried to open the door, when it didn't open she started knocking and calling out hello it's me open up. I didn't respond at first as I was on a call with a client but she kept banging on the door so loudly I ended up having to put the client on hold. I told her without opening the door I was on a call and could not talk right now and my aunt left in a huff. Now she's bombarding my mom with texts about how rude I was for locking myself in my office knowing I was having company.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nUpdate: Go to dinner for a few hours, return to reddit only to find out this has exploded. First of all thank you all for your confirmation that this isn't on me. I did not think I was the asshole, but there's always that hint of doubt where you're like hmmm maybe I should have poked my head out and said hello real quick, but the truth was it was a busy day today and I just hadn't had the time.\n\nNow for the update: After I finished my workday, I took my mom out for dinner and we discussed the matter. She hadn't responded to any of her sisters (my aunt's) texts because she is fully on my side. I know people are asking why my mom didn't stop her, my mom isn't very mobile anymore and my aunt simply got up from her seat and took off upstairs despite my mom's warning.\n\nWe discussed it over dinner and we agreed that my aunt simply is no longer welcome during office hours, since it's the only way to stop this behaviour, either she can pick up my mom to go to a coffee shop and talk, come after office hours, or come over on the one day I work in office. My aunt seems pretty pissy about it, calling their brother (my uncle) to complain also, but he texted me earlier saying he told her how wrong she was and apparantly her husband had also told her she was wrong so now she's currently stomping her feet at home because everybody is saying she's wrong. Delightfull woman she is... remind me to one day post the story about her disneyland trip.\n\nAnyways TLDR: Mom and I decided she's no longer welcome at my house during office hours.\n\nUpdate to the update: This is the cliffnotes version of the Disneyland story \n\nShe has twin boys, and for their birthday she booked a trip to take them an one of their friends out to disneyland. The friend ended up cancelling last minute and told me if I paid the friends share I could go. Reasonable enough , I figured why not. (I was 16 at the time this story is like 20 years old) I'm european so this is disneyland Paris i'm talking about, and I'm not from France so this is a international trip (this becomes important later) my cousins are maybe 10ish at this point. So anyways we're in the parks and she has been a menace all trip already but i'm dealing with it. It's the last day about 5 hours before we have to take our train back home (international traveling train with customs etc like a plane would be only less boarding time)\n\nOne of my cousins wants to go on the rock and roll rollercoaster the other one doesn't. The line is like 5 minutes or less so my aunt tells me to go with him and she'll wait at the exit with our bags. So I leave my bag containing my phone my ID my money EVERYTHING in her care.\n\nTen minutes later me and my cousin get out of the ride, and she is GONE. So I start looking around, cannot find her, after half an hour of waiting (maybe they went to the bathroom or something) still nothing. We go check the bathrooms, neighboring rides the works no aunt. I have no phone on me to call her, and with us having to leave for the train in 4 hours I get nervous. I'm a 16 year old with a ten year old at my hand and no money no ID no phone nothing.\n\nSo I decide to go to the lost kids department and explain my situation. They end up calling her through the parks intercom.. another hour goes by... no Aunt. I remember my dad's phone number back home so I use Disney's land line to call him, he tries calling her cellphone my cellphone no response whatsoever. At this point I have like an hour or less before the train leaves and i'm in hystericals because I can't board this train without money or ID let alone with another minor. My cousin at this point seeing my panic is crying his eyes out so i'm also dealing with a scared child i'm barely an adult myself.\n\nMy dad eventually tells me it makes no sense for him to drive out to Paris right now, to go back to our hotel he'll pay for another night and he'll come pick us up in the morning. So I take my cousin back to the hotel explain the situation and the receptionist hears me say my name and says:\" Oh sweetheart I have a note for you\" it's a note from my aunt: Gone to dinner see you on the train...\n\nAt this point I have half an hour to run to the station , hoping we'll still get through customs where she's supposed to be waiting. I make it with 15 minutes to spare i'm out of breath, and FUMING. We end up making it through customs god only knows how and manage to get on the train literally as the doors close on us. I call my dad explain the update and he is also fuming at this point. To which my aunt turns to me and goes: I don't know why you're so mad, I left a note at the hotel and I brought you something to eat and hands me a freaking dinner roll..\n\nI took my stuff, went to the dining car with my cousin who she also almost abandonned and gave him the biggest slice of chocolat cake my budget could buy and never came back to our seats to talk to her xD",

      "scenario_description": "TLDR: SIL didn't want to go to my husband's birthday party and is now expecting us to plan another since she can't afford to host another one herself. WIBTA for saying no?\n\nHis birthday was last month. His family is obsessed with celebrating birthdays, even though we are all 30yo+. That's fine, but you can understand how hard it is to get 10+ family and friends together for every single birthday when everyone is working different schedules.\n\nWhen his birthday was approaching, I had heard nothing about plans but knew his sister had bought him tons of gifts, so I stepped up and sent out an invite for something my husband wanted to do - a barbecue at the beach. Free, relaxing, and a chance to enjoy the beautiful weather. \n\nHis sister responded, disappointed, that she and her family would actually prefer dinner at a restaurant because they want to be indoors/in the AC. My first thoughts were that, if you are invited to an event that you can't or don't want to attend for some reason, asking the host to cancel or change those plans entirely is quite rude. \n\nIn an effort to stand our ground, we let them know we were going ahead with the barbecue, but if they wanted to plan a separate birthday dinner, they were welcome to. \n\nSo, SIL chooses this upcoming weekend for a family-feast-style dinner at a nearby restaurant. Neat! We adjust our schedules to accomodate. As the day approaches, husband reaches out to sister to ask what the plans are. Turns out, she has nothing planned - hasn't invited anyone else, hasn't made reservations, and hasn't looked at the menu to calculate the cost breakdown. \n\nThe family meals at the restaurant come to $120 each, feeding 4 people. That would feed SIL's family alone. With the rest of us added, we would need at least 2 meals to feed everyone. When we talked all this over with SIL, she realized that the cost splitting would still be over $30pp. That's when she admitted that they just paid their bills and can't afford it.\n\nNo worries. Sorry it didn't work out!\n\nNope. She's now asking *us* to plan something else, something that's less expensive, because she's out of ideas. \"Can we have the party at your place?\" Why, so I get to buy all the food and stress about prepping the apartment to host on short notice? \"Wish we could, but our house is a mess while we're reorganizing\". She is currently waiting for us to think of something else.\n\nConsidering: 1) we already hosted a birthday party that she didn't want to go to, 2) her poor planning would have ended with us footing a $200+ bill, and 3) the series of inconsiderate requests, my husband and I are ready to cancel. Knowing this would break her heart, WIBTA?",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nSo I (34 f) have a little sister (28 f) that needed somewhere to go to get her and her 3 small kids away from her abusive boyfriend. My wife and I had just moved across the country, back to my hometown, to be closer to the family literally about two weeks prior to us giving her somewhere safe to stay. Shortly after that she made up a story about taking the kids camping with her two best friends. Later, we find out (from the kids) that they were actually with said ex boyfriend. I sat her down and explained to her that I knew the truth and that I knew she lied to me. She altered the story slightly to include him saying he “just showed up” yet none of the other friends were even there😐\n\nFast forward to this weekend and my wife and I are out of town. Sister is at the housing watching the dogs so she reaches out and says her and her best friend are taking a trip to Colorado. Cool. I tell her to have so much fun. We converse a bit about Colorado over the weekend and then I went to text her again and her location popped up (she had said a few days before that she was setting up Siri and it must have messed up her location settings when I asked why her location was off). Her location said she was in Arkansas (which she used to take a lot of trips to when she was dating the ex boyfriend) so I straight up ask her “hey why are you in Arkansas?” And she replies saying they changed the plan due to money and I said “Is that true? Cause I know you went to AR with *ex boyfriend” all the time and really hope you’re not lying to me again”. She went on to assure me she was telling the truth even adding in more detail about her friend and what they did.\n\nThat was yesterday. I got an unrelated call today from one of my best friends. We talked about things in our lives going on since I’d been out of state and then she asks if my sister was dating that guy again. I ask her why she’d ask and she says because they just went on a trip together and she saw it on facebook. He posted multiple pictures and even named the exact place my sister had claimed to be with her friend. \n\nI set a boundary, after the first lie, that if she wanted to live with us then she couldn’t also be with him. Now, if she wants to go date that loser then it’s her life and she absolutely can…just not while living with us. Also, that she can’t lie to me. We are trusting her with our home, our pets, and everything that comes with it. It’s supposed to be our safe space and this guy is OFF THE RAILS with alcohol, drugs, and violence. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to kick her out for lying to me and hanging out with him?",

We could not look more different. He's got more than a foot of height on me and probably about the same weight, so he's obviously more visibly fit. He brags a lot about how even after we spend all day chasing kids in the sun, he still goes to the gym for a couple of hours. \n\nThe issue is when it comes to actually having to use strength practically, I out do him every time. I'm not trying to do it intentionally. But when we have to carry 20 kids backpacks and he can only handle 8 while I have 12, or when he can't open a jar, or when we have to lug heavy equipment and he's huffing and puffing while I'm not having a problem, it becomes pretty evident that I am just stronger than him, at least for stuff like that. I'm sure he could out bench me or whatever proper fitness stuff is, and trust me he crushes me when we play sports with the kids, I'm just talking about that kind of work.\n\nThe issue is that the kids have started to pick up on the fact that I am the \"strong counselor\". If they want to be picked up or can't open something in their lunch or want a break from carrying their bag on a hike, they come to me. Apparently, my co-counselor complained to one of the other counselors that I am \"embarrassing\" him because a guy like me shouldn't be able to be stronger than him. That counselor then came to me and told me I should tone it done because it can be hard for someone who prides themself on being an athlete to be worse at something than a guy \"like me\". I said there was no way I was going to do my job worse just to protect hit ego, and the other counselor said I was being a jerk and as the summer goes on the boys might start bullying my co-counselor if they think he's weaker than me, which I don't think is going to happen but I'm not sure. \n\nAITA for not wanting to stop doing my job the way I'm doing it so that I don't hurt this guys feelings?",

      "scenario_description": "A while ago, I helped out two close friends, Steven (a good friend and former coworker) and his girlfriend Clara. We worked together for about four years until I moved away 8 months ago, but we stayed in touch and I visited a few times. I also became good friends with Clara. They live in a rented house.\n\nTwo months ago, they adopted a stray cat. They were absolutely over the moon! Since they’d never had a cat before and I’ve had cats all my life, they messaged me constantly with questions.\n\nThey had a one-week vacation booked before adopting the cat. Clara asked if I could come stay in their home and take care of her. She said it was a big ask, but I was the only person she trusted. I have a flexible work situation, and they’re good friends, so I agreed.\n\nI used 5 vacation days, traveled 6 hours to their city, and stayed 7 days. I took care of the cat, watered plants, and sent daily photo updates. Their fridge was fully stocked, I didn’t spend anything. But the week was rough. I had relationship problems, tend to overthink, and the cat went into heat and meowed nonstop (they said they'd fix her before, but it didn’t happen). With not much to do and the constant noise, I was really drained. Still, I got through it.\n\nOn day 6, I sent Steven a voice message saying I was happy to be heading home and explained how I’d clean before leaving, but some mess would remain. He replied I shouldn't worry and they’d handle it all.\n\nI left the next day. Second 6 hour trip. Two hours after I got home, Steven called. Very polite, but clearly upset, he said they were shocked at how I left the place, and told me Clara could not stop crying. I was stunned. I told him I thought part of the “compensation” for my help was that I didn’t need to leave the place spotless. He admitted he misunderstood my message and thought I planned to deep-clean. We ended the call politely and chalked it up to miscommunication.\n\nHere’s what I left:\n\n1. Empty bottles (refundable in my country) stacked on the table.\n2. Trash that could rot was taken out; cardboard and other dry trash were left in one spot.\n3. Used towels and bedsheets in a pile near the bed.\n4. Some rinsed dishes in the dishwasher, 3–4 items were rinsed but not loaded.\n\nNo danger in reach for the cat. I’ve lived alone for 9 years and have always been considered tidy. But yes, I failed to consider their much higher cleaning standards. I apologized to Steven the next day for seeing only through my own lens.\n\nClara, however, sent a very harsh message: she was deeply disappointed, called me ungrateful, ended the friendship, and said I shouldn't even dare to justify my behavior or apologize for anything. That message hit me hard. I lashed out in return, called her ungrateful, crazy, emotionally unstable. Childish, I know.\n\nNow Clara and I are done. Things with Steven are strained.  \nThe damage is done. But I still wonder:  \n**AITA for not leaving the house spotless after cat-sitting for free?**",

You could have washed it if the machine is in the house. It's not that hard to do.  \nThere's no excuse for leaving trash in the house for them to dispose of. Why would you expect them to by OK coming home to your trash?  \nAll the dishes should have been in the dishwasher - and it should have been run. Who thinks leaving dirty dishes behind is OK?  \nI'm guessing that there was a better way to leave the empties than \"stacked on the table\" but you can have a pass on that one.  \nYour former friends didn't want a spotless house, I don't believe that they expected a \"deep clean\". I think that they were shocked to have to clean up after you when they arrived home.",
