      "scenario_description": "I'm (40m) a father of 3.  My SIL (27f) and her husband (27m) had their first kid 2 years ago.  She's my wife's sister and we tend to see each other at least once a month for family events.\n\nFor my wife and I, we manage our kids ourselves.  If we go somewhere, one of us is always keeping an eye on them, making sure they're not getting into trouble - especially making sure the youngest (a toddler) is safe - changing her if necessary, refilling her sippy cup, stuff like that.  Its our job.  If something happens, one of us pops up and takes care of it.\n\nSIL and her husband take a different approach and are frequently asking for help.  If we're all eating dinner and their kid has a poopy diaper, they'll sometimes get it, sometimes turn to one of us and ask \"would you mind?\"  The other day, I'm at a party and just came back inside after getting something for my kids, ready to sit down to eat and SIL asks \"\\[Baby\\] left her sippy cup upstairs - would you mind getting it?\"  Her and her husband both sitting down and perfectly capable.  It's not like they've asked a few times when they're overwhelmed or there's only one of them - there's been times one of them is lying on a couch reaching a book and ask me for something.\n\nIt's not like what they ask for anything I'd consider a huge inconvenience, so I feel petty saying something - but part of me just wants to say \"Look, my wife and I are responsible for our kids - you're responsible for yours.  I don't ask you to change our kids' diapers or grab their sippy cups from the next room, don't ask me.\"  WIBTA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I’ve (22f) posted here about my roommate (24f) before. She has always had issues contributing to the household, including buying things like toilet paper, dish soap, laundry detergent, etc. She also rarely does her dishes promptly or takes out the trash or other household chores, and struggles to pay utilities on time. Sometimes I even have to hound her for the rent. I felt bad at first because clearly she wasn’t equipped to live alone but I quickly got frustrated and became short with her. We were friends at first but not so much anymore after I’ve had to put up with her for this long. \n\nOur year long lease ended and we have been living month to month since then. Eventually she got a boyfriend. He lives with his parents but that hasn’t stopped her from spending most of her time at their house. I started seeing her less and less. \n\nA couple days into May I hadn’t seen her for maybe two weeks. I texted and called her to see when she was going to pay her share of rent (due on the 5th) but she basically ghosted me. I got in contact with her mom and eventually my roommate reached out to say she’s staying with her boyfriend’s family “for now” and doesn’t think she should be expected to pay rent for somewhere she’s not staying. I kindly asked if that meant she would be moving out but she didn’t respond. \n\nI paid rent myself, which was a huge unexpected expense. After that I decided I was done. I texted her over the course of May and June asking her to move her stuff out but she didn’t respond to me. Her mom kept promising me that her daughter would take care of it but she never once got back to me.\n\nAfter July started I recruited a couple friends to help me pack up the stuff in her room and donated most of it to Goodwill and the Salvation Army. I also asked the landlord to change the locks which he did. \n\nThe other evening she finally shows up and is mad that the locks have been changed. I told her she’s not living here and doesn’t pay rent so she has no reason to enter the apartment. She got even more upset and said that she was never moving out, she was just staying with him for the time being. She told me the situation didn’t work out so she planned to come back and live here again. I told her that she was already off the lease and it’s my rental now. She started crying and said she had nowhere else to go and I felt really bad. She asked if she could at least get some of her stuff, she needed some clean clothes and a shower. I told her that because she never told me she was coming back or made plans to move her stuff out, I donated everything that was in her room unless it looked precious or expensive and stored the rest in her closet. \n\nShe completely freaked out and threatened to call the police on me. She was inconsolable. She cried about how I even donated her dead grandmother’s wedding dress, which had been in a special box somewhere in her room. I apologized profusely because I did feel really bad but it all could have been avoided if she had tried to communicate with me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I told her by July I would start getting rid of things if she didn’t make plans to do it herself. Where I live, a unit is considered abandoned once they vacate and owe rent. The cost of the items being donated will determine how long I need to store them before getting rid of them. I asked her to make arrangements for her things beginning in early May, which she ignored. I emphasized in June that I would be donating her things by July, which she also ignored. Additionally, her mother was aware the whole time and promised me her daughter would take care of it by June 30th, which she didn’t. ",

He would only show up during class lectures and would disappear on us during labs He would also laugh at us when we had serious questions about certain topics making it seem like we’re stupid for being curious?\n\nFor our final project which consists also half of our grade, he interrupted others’ ideas and mine as well for an innovative design and pushed his own, which he willingly said he would do it and it would be easy, then ghosted us the day before submission. My group scrambled and submitted a rushed backup plan. We then removed him from the project entirely, which will cause him to fail.\n\nNow he’s acting like we excluded him unfairly, and people think I’m the bad guy for leading the decision.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (21F) let my mom borrow $8000 at the start of the year. For context, I didn’t have a good relationship with my mom after I left home when I was 19. We exchanged a lot of words and I cut her off. Last year I got my Cows and Plows, which is a large sum of money for Indigenous Peoples. Shortly after my mom reached out after months and asked for $8000. She claimed she was on the verge of losing the house and she (and her boyfriend) were behind bills. Mind you, they couldn’t afford the house after nearly all the kids grew up and moved out. I caved in and gave her the money, signing legal IOU papers to make sure she paid me back. I felt bad because my little brother is still living with her. She was supposed to start paying me back in March. Nothing. In April, only $300 when the minimum agreement was $500. May and June, nothing at all. She told me to not tell anyone and no one knew of their financial struggle. But here I find out that she was borrowing money from nearly everyone she could—my siblings, aunts, uncles, and I think my grandma as well. I gave her the largest amount. I also learned that her boyfriend, who was seemingly always out of the job did have a job… rating movies online in exchange for bitcoin. He was borrowing money to keep unlocking the next level in this bitcoin website. \n\nAnd now, I was considering taking her to small claims court and my sister, although she means well, told my mom that even tho I didn’t want her to. My mom texted me just today and started saying a bunch of awful things to me. Telling me I’m a disgrace and that I will never amount to anything, so on and so forth. And I also learned that they stole money from my older brother while he was in the hospital. She threatened to charge me with harassment even tho she was the one that reached out to say all these things to me. Small claims court was the last resort, but would it have been too much? AITA for wanting my money back? ",

      "scenario_description": "So my gf and one of my coworkers have very bad blood. They used to be close friends and my gf was unfortunately manipulated and done very dirty by the coworker, and it all stems from a relationship with my gf's ex. My coworker is now dating her ex. This coworker has also been horrible to my gf, going so far as to message another one of my gf's exes that she may end up in court with and has spread lies and rumors about my gf. Here's my predicament: as part of my job, i have to talk to this coworker from time to time throughout the day. I have no choice, our jobs are linked. Can't do mine without the coworker. I've tried to cut contact to an absolute minimum but it's impossible to work and have completely zero conversation, and it's of course only work-related. My gf had an issue about a month or so ago because i was visibly stressed and she saw me laugh at a quick joke the coworker made (very in the moment, high-stress job), then walked away quickly to go back to work. I apologized, tried to ease her mind, and we moved on. My gf even admitted she knows there's no way around the issue due to the nature of our jobs, and she also admitted her feelings are irrational. The issue arose again yesterday because she saw me \"talking to\" the coworker again but in reality, it was work related, for all of 6 seconds, and i needed a phone number i knew the coworker had and needed it ASAP. It's caused a pretty big fight. What am i supposed to do? AITA? I can't change how my department works, nor can i avoid her completely 100%. Any advice?",

      "scenario_description": " My (27f) sister (34f) just moved back to our hometown and is living with my parents, who don't charge her rent. She has a very good job and is in no need of money, lives rather luxuriously. Her new job will cover $2000 of rent for 2 months while she gets situated if she provides a record of a lease. She doesn't plan on using it within the required timeframe since she likes living with my parents. \nShe sees an opportunity to make $4k by having my husband (since he doesn't share the same last name as her) write a fake sublease agreement so she can receive the stipend from her job (a large, private company). \n\nShe asked him, and he was clearly uncomfortable. She then follows up with \"I totally understand if you don't want to, no pressure at all\". He said he'd think about it, kindly of course because he is non confrontational.  In talking to him just the two of us, he is uncomfortable, especially since this isn't the first time she's asked him to do something like this (last time he complied). Even though it's not lying to an official agency (minimal risk) and would be taking money from a huge company that is ready to spend it, he doesn't like being pressured into compromising his morals. (Sometimes I get frustrated at this too, he really is a rule follower.  But his moral compass is something so core to who he is and one of the reasons I love him). \n\nMy sister followed up with me privately today to see if he made a decision, and I communicated that it made him uncomfortable, but it wasn't a categorical no. I asked if she could ask one of her good friends instead. She already had and this friend said no. My sister then keeps pressing me, saying it's a lot of money and is no risk. When I said I'd take it back to my husband now that we know there's \"no other option\", she got really mad at me. She is holding a grudge, and is \"sick of this in between yes and no\" as if this didn't warrant discussion. She is mad at both me and my husband, saying we are inconsiderate. Am I the asshole?\n\nUpdate!! Brought it back up to my sister and told her it's a no, she's already holding a grudge but at least that means she didn't want to talk to me any more about it lol\nI apologized to my husband and we're good. Thank you all for making me realize the errors of my ways! And to those who were asking about what's in it for me - she wasn't planning on giving us a cut at all!\n",

The difference is, I did not meet the guy asking for it in person before\n\nWe work at different offices of the same place and are quite friendly online, I know they are legit, so I sent them a small amount first which they promised to pay me back by Friday - on Thursday they asked for more\n\nMy golden rule is I NEVER send more until they pay back the first amount, which I think is reasonable, but they made me feel quite shit about it and now I am confused\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nPS: some important context. The guy was asking for money because apparently the payment software at their office broke, so I called some people there and turns out that was a lie and everyone got paid on time ??? one of the reasons I hesitated to give him a second loan",

      "scenario_description": "I had a friend come visit from out of town for a long weekend. We've been friend over 20 years,  and I was excited to see her.\n\nShe's had cats in the past, but married someone who is highly allergic to almost anything with fur, so she hasn't had any furred pets in many years (she has some reptiles). I have nurmerous cats, and she was also excited to get a weekend of kitties.\n\nHowever, it became clear very quickly that she doesn't live with cats. Leaving food unattended, putting cups on the edge of the coffee table/counter, etc, made it a very messy weekend. But whatever, right?\n\nThen there was the dental floss.\n\nFor context here, one of my cats ate a string he pulled out of a rug several months ago, and I paid THOUSANDS to save him. Like, he should have died - not only was it a very long string, but he had numerous post-op complications. But he is my baby, and it was money well spent to me. My cat learned exactly nothing from the experience - he still LOVES string and hair ties, and I am hypervigilant about such things being left out where he can access them.\n\nI told my friend she CANNOT throw dental floss in the bathroom trash - it has to go in the kitchen trash. The bathroom trash had a lid, but this cat is very smart and very determined. And in the event the lid doesn't get closed, it's essentially leaving string right at cat-height.\n\nWell, she didn't get the (very direct, not even a hint) hint. I kept finding floss in the bathroom trash, and twice I found it just laying on the counter, waiting to be swallowed. The first couple times, I tried to gently remind her. Then I directly told her again. When I found floss, yet again, just laying on the counter, I told her she needed to hand over her floss. I have the little floss picks she can use, but I cannot have long strings just being left around the house willy nilly. I cannot afford to have another major emergency vet surgery. I was not rude about it, and I did not yell or anything, but it was just too big a risk to keep allowing her to leave it lying about. \n\nShe complied, but after she went home her husband called me and said I was being totally put of line and treating her like a child, and that I should be more concerned with teaching my cat not to eat string. I do sort of see his point, but the reality is I tried to remind her not to do it, and it wasn't sticking. It's literally  a safety issue in my home - one that could mean life or death. If she couldn't manage to dispose of floss in the kitchen, then my only choice to protect my dumb ass cat is to remove the dangerous item. There is no \"teaching\" a cat to not use their insticts, and hunting/eating things is instinct.\n\nAITA here? I feel like no, but the way her husband acted, I'm now not totally sure.\n\n(And yes, I gave her floss back before she left. I'm not a floss thief)",

I can work partially remotely but have to be at the office 2 days a week. The commute is is 1,5 hours each way with public transport, so 3 hours a day plus delays usually (Germany) and it has been wearing me down for the past months.\n\n\n\nAt some point, my sister (28F) offered me to stay at her apartment for free on the days that I was going to the office, which would cut the commute down by half. She hasn’t been living in her apartment for close to a year now and living with her boyfriend full-time so she told me that me staying there would be no problem. In the beginning she told me that she was planning on keeping her place for the rest of the year because her and her boyfriend were looking for a new place to move in together but didn’t have the time or energy for a big move right now and that her furniture wouldn’t fit into their current place. When I asked about paying her rent she told it was fine because she had to keep the place for the rest of the year either way. \n\n\n\nIt’s been a few weeks now of me going to her apartment every Sunday night and leaving Wednesday morning. I bring everything I need for the days and only keep a few items of clothing there just in case. I make sure to leave the place clean and don’t touch her things. The place is also very small with basically just a kitchen, a table and a couch to sleep on.\n\n\n\nNow she’s suddenly pressuring me to pay a third of the rent arguing that she is providing me a “mostly furnished apartment” to use whenever I want and that because of me she couldn’t live there now. I would be fine with paying her something of course but even the days that I am using the apartment I am out of the house most of the day and basically just have dinner and go to bed so a third doesn’t sound fair to me. AITA for not paying a third of her rent?",

      "scenario_description": "My friend's wedding is near the end of this year and she wants me to be her man of honor. I am considering not going.\n\nWe met in undergrad and have been friends for 4 years. In school, we hung out almost every day. After undergrad, she moved back to her hometown on the other side of the country and returned to her old job. I started grad school and a new job. We have both been busy and don't talk often.\n\nWhenever I talk to her in person or voice chat, she is warm and excited to talk to me. Getting to that point is a problem because she is SO disorganized. When we make plans, she's either late or doesn't show up. When I text to ask where she is, she takes an hour+ to reply. More than once, she drove all the way to my city to see family and didn't tell me until she was already here. Once she said she would be in town next week and then didn't reply to my message for 5 days. I had to contact her partner to tell her to reply. My spouse and I visited them last year, but it feels like every time they're here, it's because they're seeing family and we just happen to be in the area.\n\nThe last time we talked, she suggested playing a game at 7pm. I said I'd be there. I waited an hour and asked if she was still going to be on. She got on 2 hours late, no apology or excuse.\n\nShe is sometimes apologetic but hasn't gotten any better with punctuality. She says she's too busy to hang out but I also see her and her roommates online gaming together almost every night, playing games that I would join for if they asked.\n\nMy spouse and I visited last year and met her friends. At some point she said that she never had a best friend. My spouse pointed at me. She looked surprised and said \"but we haven't known each other that long\".\n\nShe asked me to be her \"man of honor\" for her wedding. I was surprised since we barely talked for the last year. I didn't think we were that close now, especially after the above conversation. I said I was flattered but might not be the best choice since I live far away and wouldn't be able to coordinate things from here. She said it wasn't a problem and I wouldn't have to organize anything.\n\nI still haven't heard any details about the wedding. It's in 3 months. She told me the date and venue when I asked, but hasn't sent out invites. I have no idea what the plan is or if she even has a plan.\n\nI have to take time off work, school, and my internship to make it to her wedding. I feel like the wedding has had less effort put into it than the effort required for me to be there. Mostly, I feel hurt and abandoned because I went through a lot this past year dealing with chronic pain, my spouse almost dying, and disentangling myself from narcissistic parents. We supported each other through a lot when she lived here, but now that we're long-distance she's MIA. She barely knows what's going on in my life and I don't know what's going on in hers. After putting in all this effort, I feel checked out  and want to move on.",

I watch the first 3-4 episodes and memorises the voices and then almost only listen thereafter, unless a new character is introduced. I honestly don’t enjoy watching TV, but I like to have some visual clues still. \n\nMy husband will take over the TV at any time he wants to, because “you’re not watching it anyways!”. He furthermore argues that he gets dibs because I could just put on an audiobook. He gets the TV for himself roughly half the time. I don’t like listening to action and horror, which means that when he watches those things, I can’t enjoy our living room. He won’t use headphones. It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth that he takes the TV and then indirectly throws me out of the living room. He’ll also pout when I leave the living room. \n\nI have confronted him multiple times about it, but it always ends at a standstill where he argues that he’s entitled to enjoy watching what he likes and that it’s a waste of a screen when I only use the speakers. That I’m not normal asking him to watch TV with headphones on.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "I 28F has been married for 6 months now I live with my super loving husband and MIL. My MIL tho is not what I expected her to be at first she was good but then lately she started to create problems between me and my husband. I've been hearing quite a lot about her problematic behaviour from my sister in law's but I used to brush them of thinking if MIL is good to me then I need not to worry about her. \n\nNow the drama part she wants me to talk to people who she talks to, and not to talk with people who she has started beef with. earlier she was okay with me talking with them, bcz she was talking with them but then now she has a beef with them. She wants me to stop talking with them now that friends with them (them being my husband's eldest brothers family) and stop going to their house which I think is unfair. I can’t be controlled like that like I need to have my own space and control on my own life. I am not a puppet. \n\nso now that I’m not listening to her. She started abusing me literally cursing me because I was not listening to her. I told my husband about that and he understandably talked to her mother. but she won’t listen to anybody. \n\nA few weeks ago she was fighting with me, bcz I went to their house she went crazy she said so many bad things about me and my period. I literally started to cry when I was standing in the kitchen and half of the things I forgot what she said, (that’s how I am)\n\nand I don’t know if she cursed my parents or not. It seems like she did. I didn’t hear it properly, but I feel like she did, and I took it to the sky. I was furious, and I was so so mad. ( Rightfully so) And when my husband got back from work. She told him her perspective and painted me bad, which was very weird. like hello, you were the one who started the fight. You were the one who cursed me and my parents, you were the one put it all the wrong things and now I am the bad person???\n\n\nThen later, my husband asked me about the situation and I told him the truth, but about the part where she cursed my parents or not I thought she did, so I told my husband she did and thankfully my husband was mad on her mom too as to why to bring my parents in a fight they don't even know is happening. \n\n\nMy MIL was saying she does not want to stay with me and that she wants to go to her daughters house. My husband used to stop her before this fight but this time he didn’t. so now I don’t know if I am the bad one like, I think I am taking advantage of the situation because I am not completely sure if she did or not, she like used to mumble things, and I think I heard her curse my parents, which was very wrong, of course but then I don’t know if she did or not. ( English is not my first language so bare with me).",

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

My sister has an upcoming conference for an internship in DC and asked to stay at my apartment. I told my sister that she is more than welcome to stay with me, but she first needs to admit to lying and apologize. She is refusing to do what I asked, so I have informed her that she will need to get a hotel room.

      "scenario_description": "EDITED TO CLARIFY. \nMy husband (35m) and I (33f) are expecting our second child this summer. We have the c section date schedule, so like, it’s coming soon.. soon soon. With our first, my MIL stayed at our house to care for our three dogs and a cat while we were in the hospital having the first baby, also by c section. We were there 3 nights. This go around we still have the same house, same pets (minus two dogs, RIP the good boy and girl) add a toddler and are planning on leaving a day earlier since we have a better idea of what we’re doing. Initially she was game to stay at our house with our toddler (2.5m) and our pets, and she already took off work those days to be here…so we didn’t make any other plans. Now speaking with her. She’s trying to convince us that she needs to stay at her house with our toddler and we can just take the dog somewhere and we can pick both up the day we come home. I told my husband absolutely not. If that’s the game, then we will find some other family member who will either watch both at their house or who will stay here for both. We’re not even asking her to stay all day.. and the toddler goes to day care during the day. We’re just looking for someone to be here in the evenings for the dog to have company and be taken care of twice a day and so the toddler can stay in his house and routine. It’s literally two nights unless something goes wrong. AITA? \n\nAdditional info:\nDog is DOG reactive. Loves people. No bite history. No other dogs around. Only has health issues when severely stressed, but none for a while. Couch potato dog. \n\nMIL was happy to agree to this in November when  asked. Confirmed it again sometime in April, still happy to help and stay at our house. When told the date of c section, in 3 weeks, changed her mind while on the phone. We mentioned having FIL (they’re divorced) watch both. She doesn’t want that only wants GC. \n\nMILs house is not childproofed. No gates for steps and a dog that HAS bit toddler. Plus 3 cats that have also bit and scratched toddler. \n",

      "scenario_description": "I [15M] was arguing with my father [42M] because I came home high after hanging out with friends. (Context: I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for around 9 years, but getting high is a great stress reliever for me.) So, I was out with some friends because going out helps me feel less lonely and sad. Sometimes when I’m with them I get high to help with other stuff. Usually I make sure I’m sober by the time I’m home, but I’ve very stressed lately, so I got higher than usual. When I eventually had to come home, my dad commented on how sluggish and weird I was being. He looked at my eyes and smelled my breath, and he knew I was high, so he immediately began yelling and screaming at me. I’m almost never honest with what goes on in my life with my parents, so all my dad knows is that I’m lazy and have no aspirations to do anything. He couldn’t understand what I could possibly have to be stressed about, so I was just honest and told him.. He is the main cause of my stress. He’s always so mean, ignorant, selfish, and just rude in general. I just couldn’t hold back, I let all of my anger out on him. I just yelled at him about how he is such a terrible father and how much I resent him. By the time I stopped, he started crying, and he just left. I’m not sure where he went, but my family is VERY upset with me, and I’m upset with myself. I feel like such a jerk and bad person. I just wanted an outside perspective on this situation, so, Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: i know this post seems very one sided, I just didn’t wanna make this post too long by including the context. I also acknowledge my mistakes and I try really hard to right my wrongs. I know I shouldn’t be getting high, especially not as much as I do, but I do a lot of other things to better my mental health, but none of it helps. I go to therapy, I also take FLUoxetine for my anxiety and depression. The only thing that really helps is SH and drugs. I know neither are good for me or really anyone else, but nothing else helps. I’ve quit and relapsed on a lot of things multiple times. I have a lot of problems, and I am fully willing to admit that. I’ve also been trying to fix my relationship with my family and my dad in specific. It just feels like he doesn’t want that though. He always makes little things big. I try not to raise my voice, but I just couldn’t hold in my thoughts and my feelings anymore. I do feel terrible for what happened, and I will apologize for my actions the second I can contact my dad.",

      "scenario_description": "I, 27F, recently agreed to take care of my friend’s cat while she was away traveling for a few days.\n\nWe’re not really close friends, but she asked me because her apartment is close to my work, and I live an hour away from my office.\n\nFrom last Wednesday to Saturday morning, I stayed at her place for cat sitting, and I was happy to help because it was reduced commute for me and it’s not much work to take care of a cat.\n\nShe was supposed to be back Saturday night, and I left enough food for the day for the cat as I was leaving around noon.\n\nAround 6PM as I was having dinner with friends at a restaurant back in my city, my friend called me to tell me that her flight had been cancelled, and they rebooked her flight so she will arrive Sunday noon instead of Saturday night.\n\nShe asked me if I could come back to her apartment to feed the cat, as I am the only one with the spare key to her apartment.\n\nI told her I am in the middle of dinner and we are going to a party afterwards, nothing bad will happen to the cat if she skips a meal or two until tomorrow noon, so I can’t drop everything now and travel 2 hours (back and forth) to feed the cat.\nI did offer, if for whatever reason her flight is further delayed, then I will come on Sunday to feed the cat.\n\nThen she told me she can’t believe I would let a poor innocent animal starve and suffer, just to be able to party and enjoy myself. \nShe said this is animal abuse and she will have to report me.\n\nShe hung up on me, and then she sent me a series of text that switches from begging for me to go to her apartment to cursing me that I am a cruel animal abuser.\n\nI ignored all her messages and today I gave her key to a common friend so she can get the key back, as I don’t feel comfortable talking to her anymore unless she reaches out with an apology.\n\nA part of me does feel bad about what happened tho, maybe she was just paranoid about her cat suffering?\n\n\nSo what do you think…. AITA for refusing to travel an hour to feed her cat in this situation??\n\n\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (26f) got married last month and I (29f) thought everything went ok. She had a beautiful venue, but I thought her wedding was a bit trashy.\n\nHer dress was beautiful if cheap. It was a midi dress with off the shoulder sleeves. I advised her to cover her arms because she’s got a “patchwork” tattoo sleeve on her left arm and I asked her if she really wanted a mouse in a party hat or a cowboy cat in her wedding photos. To which she said, “I think it’ll look sick as hell.”\n\nShe looked beautiful on her wedding day aside from her tattoos and the bit of rodent pee she got on her dress from when she insisted on taking pictures with her “babies”.\n\nThen for the reception she ordered pizza and had a Walmart sheet cake. Why? So she could spend money on a bounce house and ballpit.\n\nI thought the worst part of her wedding was that she didn’t allow kids to come to save money and because in her words “kids can be attention whores”. So I had to pay $100 for a sitter in addition to the $200 I gave them as a wedding gift.\n\nAt the end of the night, she and a bunch of party guests ended up jumping into the pool at her hotel because she “thought it would be fun” and bribed the night manager at the hotel to open the pool again so they could swim for a bit which I thought was rude. So her wedding dress and her husband’s suit was ruined from that.\n\nYesterday, we were going through the photos and she said that she had the time of her life and everything went perfect. I mentioned that I thought it was a bit immature and she said I was just a stick in the mud and if I could let loose for 5 minutes, I could’ve had fun too. I tried to show her where I was coming from but her husband stepped in and said if I didn’t have anything nice to say, I shouldn’t say anything at all and that even his 5th grade students knew that. I didn’t say anything else about it but what she said still kinda hurts.\n\nAITA for saying that I though my sisters wedding was immature and trashy?",

After she cleaned the bathroom and suggested it should probably be cleaned more, I suggested that maybe we could start to share responsibility for cleaning the bathroom, and she thought this was totally unreasonable, because it's my place, she still has her own place, and she doesn't want to feel like she's \\~expected\\~ to contribute to these kinds of things.

She has a hard time keeping jobs and has other struggles. We tried living together in our 30s but it was a disaster mainly because she wouldn’t pay rent or keep a job.  I feel bad for her and give her money when I can.  I’m just afraid that if she moves in she will never leave.  I feel like I always need to help her.  She has been in therapy for years but not improving. When she drinks she gets very mean as well and I’m at the point in my life where I want my house to be my sanctuary.  I keep going back and forth on this decision but I need to think of my future older self and make that my priority at my age.  I told her no.  Am I the Asshole?",

They said when they settle they would like to invite us round for dinner (hasn’t happened but kind to say.) We know their names and say hello in passing and I’ve even sent his CV/resume to my workplace when he was looking for work. So yesterday he knocks round and says could we discuss childcare options with each other as we as parents all work and may need extra help so we may need them to have our son occasionally and we could have their children round. We are both full time workers but incredibly organised so have all childcare booked and planned until October. I felt I wanted to be neighbourly and say yes of course BUT also hesitant as I dont want to be saddled with kids I barely know all the time and know for sure we simply dont need extra help. Should I have given it more time before I said “thats kind of you to consider us but we are genuinely ok! Thanks!” Feel like I may have dismissed him? AITA???",

      "scenario_description": "**Throwaway:**\n\nI (39M) recently went to China with my sister (36F), her husband (we’ll call him “Doug” 40M), their son (12), my wife and our two kids (11, 9). My sister and I were born in China, but our family immigrated to Dallas when we were young. She stayed there, got married, and had her son, while I settled in the Pacific NW with my wife and two gremlins of our own.\n\nGrowing up, our parents emphasized healthy eating and staying active. My sister and I still live that way and pass it to our kids. Doug, however, is… American in every sense of that word. He grew up on ultra-processed foods (Fruit Snacks were considered fruit), and he’ll insist on starting up his Grand Wagoneer for any distance more than three blocks. He’s not TLC immobile, but definitely not built for long treks.\n\nTheir son just finished 7th grade and loved the ancient China unit, especially the Terracotta Warriors. My sister thought this the perfect time for him, being half-Chinese, to visit his ancestral homeland. I was already planning a trip to Chongqing to see family, so we added my sister’s family to the itinerary and expanded it to include places like Beijing, Xi’an, and Nanjing to match what their son had learned in school.\n\nI handled most of the planning and tried to hint that a lot of walking would be involved—especially since many Chinese cities have vast transit systems and are less car-dependent. Doug didn’t take it seriously. Once we arrived, it was clear he couldn’t keep up when we explored the landmarks. My sister often stayed behind with him, while my wife and I continued with the kids to ensure we kept up with our tour groups.\n\nIt all came to a head in our final stop: my grandmother’s hometown near Chongqing. This place is basically vertical—stairs and steep slopes everywhere. On a particularly hot, humid day, I took the kids to the local market via a park our old family helped build. Doug insisted on coming, saying he didn’t want to sit around all day. I warned it was a long walk, but he insisted.\n\nHalf a mile in, he was struggling. I slowed down, but the kids kept running ahead. After we got through the park, I convinced him to take a taxi back while I continued to the market with the kids.\n\nWhen we returned, Doug was sulking and my sister was upset. She said I was inconsiderate for not just taking a taxi to the market. I explained that would've taken longer given the layout, and the kids wouldn’t have seen the park that was part of our family history. She said she hadn’t realized how physically demanding the trip would be since she let me handle most of the planning and I didn’t consider Doug’s limits.\n\nI agree I could’ve been more considerate of Doug’s cardio, but not at the expense of my nephew and kids experiencing their cultural landmarks—especially since it was my nephew’s first time in his homeland, and my kids’ first time in Xi’an and Beijing. They all said had an amazing and educational experience.\n\nSo—AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I’m (25F), the eldest of five, raised by a single mom who placed all her expectations on me because I’m the oldest daughter and because that’s just how things are in our culture. I was expected to help raise my siblings and be responsible. So I did. I learned life skills early, did well in school, and graduated with Latin honors.\n\nMy brothers, especially the twins (24M), had a different experience. CLEARLY the favorites. My mom didn’t expect much from them. She’d laugh off their bad behavior and even used her connections to get them out of doing certain things. They constantly bragged about cheating or paying others to do their schoolwork, and it was all treated like a joke.\n\nWhen it came to the family business, I stepped back because they seemed more invested. I chose to go to med school instead, which has been financially tough but also something my mom always dreamed of for the family. Despite being in med school full-time, I’m still the one she leans on when problems come up—even though THEYRE the ones running the business. I help when I can, but I’ve told her repeatedly that they should be handling it.\n\nThen came Mother’s Day. My mom was visiting me in Manila, so I planned a surprise in advance. I bought a cake, a gift, and a huge bouquet worth about $107, all paid upfront. Two of my brothers, Mark and John, were with me and agreed to chip in for the cake and gift ($13 each). Separately, i coordinated with my mom’s boyfriend, who wanted to contribute too. After the surprise, he sent me $180 to cover the bouquet and also added a little extra as a thank you and to help me out with school. Because of this, I didn’t follow up with my brothers for their share and considered it settled.\n\nBut on actual mother’s day, when she was back in the province with the boys, Mark called to ask if there was leftover money from the bouquet they could use for another gift. I told him the money had been given to me directly—for the bouquet and to help me out—and if they wanted to get her something else, we could all chip in again. That’s when he blew up, calling me selfish and saying I never should’ve asked them to contribute in the first place because I “have more money.”\n\nI was LIVID. I told him if he’s broke, it’s because HE doesn't know how to handle money. I worked my ass off for 2 years before med school to save money. They have nothing to show for their choices but somehow always have money for gambling, vapes, and girlfriends? but not $13 for a gift for our mom? I told him they’re failures because they’ve never taken anything seriously. No drive, no accountability, no goals. And that they’ll run the family business to the ground.\n\nNow they’re upset saying I’m an ass for throwing all of this in their face and my mom says I was a bitch for not understanding their situation. I know their capabilities are limited due to their upbringing but they’re ADULTS, shouldn’t they at least learn how to save money? Am i really being a bad sister?",

She's made her choices and doesn't want anyone else interfering if it means they might have to hear their shortcomings.\n\nOtherwise, you're going to find yourself taking over for Mommy because your brothers never learned how to adult.  Do you want to take this on?  I sure wouldn't.",

      "scenario_description": "TLDR: SIL didn't want to go to my husband's birthday party and is now expecting us to plan another since she can't afford to host another one herself. WIBTA for saying no?\n\nHis birthday was last month. His family is obsessed with celebrating birthdays, even though we are all 30yo+. That's fine, but you can understand how hard it is to get 10+ family and friends together for every single birthday when everyone is working different schedules.\n\nWhen his birthday was approaching, I had heard nothing about plans but knew his sister had bought him tons of gifts, so I stepped up and sent out an invite for something my husband wanted to do - a barbecue at the beach. Free, relaxing, and a chance to enjoy the beautiful weather. \n\nHis sister responded, disappointed, that she and her family would actually prefer dinner at a restaurant because they want to be indoors/in the AC. My first thoughts were that, if you are invited to an event that you can't or don't want to attend for some reason, asking the host to cancel or change those plans entirely is quite rude. \n\nIn an effort to stand our ground, we let them know we were going ahead with the barbecue, but if they wanted to plan a separate birthday dinner, they were welcome to. \n\nSo, SIL chooses this upcoming weekend for a family-feast-style dinner at a nearby restaurant. Neat! We adjust our schedules to accomodate. As the day approaches, husband reaches out to sister to ask what the plans are. Turns out, she has nothing planned - hasn't invited anyone else, hasn't made reservations, and hasn't looked at the menu to calculate the cost breakdown. \n\nThe family meals at the restaurant come to $120 each, feeding 4 people. That would feed SIL's family alone. With the rest of us added, we would need at least 2 meals to feed everyone. When we talked all this over with SIL, she realized that the cost splitting would still be over $30pp. That's when she admitted that they just paid their bills and can't afford it.\n\nNo worries. Sorry it didn't work out!\n\nNope. She's now asking *us* to plan something else, something that's less expensive, because she's out of ideas. \"Can we have the party at your place?\" Why, so I get to buy all the food and stress about prepping the apartment to host on short notice? \"Wish we could, but our house is a mess while we're reorganizing\". She is currently waiting for us to think of something else.\n\nConsidering: 1) we already hosted a birthday party that she didn't want to go to, 2) her poor planning would have ended with us footing a $200+ bill, and 3) the series of inconsiderate requests, my husband and I are ready to cancel. Knowing this would break her heart, WIBTA?",

      "scenario_description": "I'm so upset and I do not know if I'm in the wrong. \n\nI'm 27 F. My father passed away of cancer back in 2018, when I was 20. \n\nLast weekend, my mother re-married. I get along well enough with her new husband, he's a cool guy in general, treats me and my mother well. He also has a 13 year old daughter from a previous relationship, as he's been married and divorced his ex. They have a 50/50 custody split of their daughter. \n\nDuring the wedding on Saturday, everyone had fun, I even shed some tears of joy for my mom. But Sunday, something shifted. My cousin asked if I am going to call my mom's new husband dad. I obviously said no. I already had a dad and was a fully grown woman by the time he came into my mother's life. \n\nAfter that comment, my mother and her sister pulled me aside, and started yelling at me to stop bringing up my father in front of her new husband because... he's jealous? Of a dead man? His ex is alive and they see each other every other weekend to pass the kid but he's jealous of a dead man? I basically told them to get off me. That I do not do it deliberately but my father had been my father for 20 years and naturally I bring him up sometimes in passing. Especially to my younger cousin who was only 7 when my dad passed away and barely remembers him.\n\nMy aunt went into a whole tangent how \"my dad was important to me but is not important to anybody else anymore and I should let go and move on instead of talking about him because everyone else is.\" That, in turn, made me cry and I didn't speak to either of them for the rest of the day.\n\nAITA for bringing up my dad sometimes? Is it reasonable of my mother's husband to be jealous of a literal corpse..?",

My sister (36F) recently had a baby, who is now five months old. I love my nephew and visit them whenever I can after work, but it’s usually a long trip and I get home around 9 p.m. when I go there.\n\nI live with my mom, and she doesn’t like me taking showers after 9 p.m. because of the noise. Even though I pay the water and electric bills, I try to avoid fights and respect that.\n\nMy sister just returned from maternity leave and asked me to come help with the baby every day after work so she can shower and get things done. I told her that it’s difficult for me because of how late I get home and the problems it causes at home. I also mentioned that I’m usually exhausted after work and that going there daily would be too much.\n\nShe said it was fine, but then got really upset and started yelling at me. She brought up personal things, saying I can’t keep a job and making me feel like I’m unreliable. I was just trying to explain my situation, but she seemed to take it as an attack.\n\nNow I don’t feel comfortable going to her house anymore, even though I care about her and the baby. She has a husband and in-laws who could help her too, so I don’t feel like it’s fair for her to expect this much from me.\n\nStill, I worry that my family will think I’m being selfish or uncaring.\nAITA?\n",

      "scenario_description": "I (26M) live with my partner (26F) and my younger brother (23M) in a rented townhome. My partner and I have been discussing moving for a number of reasons. Mostly, our current home is expensive and my brother is honestly not a great roommate. My brother is a typical gamer bro who did not learn enough life skills before moving out. When we first moved here several years ago we were pretty lenient so he could ease into adult life. We paid a little more than 2/3 of the bills and asked him to just keep his room/bathroom presentable, clean the kitchen floor, and be respectful.\n\nIn this time my brother has struggled to do his one household chore, his room has its own funk, and he is constantly yelling into his headset to where we can hear it from any point in the house (it has two floors). My partner and I both have roommate horror stories, and since we didn’t have to deal with typical drama we just kept reminding him to quiet down and clean regularly. Any time we had a talk with him he would tell us he’d “work on it”, then after a week or so would revert back to old behaviors. This was extremely frustrating/annoying, but I kept convincing my partner it wasn’t egregious enough to ask him to move out, and if we didn’t immediately get a new roommate the budget would be very tight. Nothing on the market was any better, none of our friends were looking to move, and we didn’t want to risk it with a stranger, so we stuck it out.\n\nLast week my partner and I got offered a casita in a nice neighborhood at a really good rate.  We know the owner personally, an honest guy who only rents it out to help pay his bills. So of course when he said his tenant was moving out and he’d give us even more of a discount if we helped maintain the main house (basic handiwork and cleaning, he has mobility issues), we jumped at the opportunity. He was thrilled at the idea of having reliable tenants he knows and we were excited about having our own space without shared walls that’s actually affordable.\n\nYesterday my partner and I told my brother we needed to talk and let him know we wanted to put in our 30-day notice so we could move into our own place, and he’d have to figure out housing for himself. He was surprisingly chill about it, but my parents both contacted me shortly afterward. My dad was pretty chill while my mom seemed a bit upset and kept questioning me about our plans and expenses. I’m guessing my brother asked my mom about moving back in basically right away since she has a spare room and none of his friends need a roommate (or maybe they don’t want to put up with him either). I think my mom just doesn’t want him to be her problem, but she’s trying to make me feel guilty about leaving family hanging. My friends of course are on my side and say it’s fair to not want to live with him and this is the consequence of her parenting. AITA for moving out and giving my brother 30 days to figure out a new housing situation on his own?",

I had my baby in the car (3 months ), after the crash baby was absolutely hysterical, of course she would be, my friend then tried to scramble in the mix of it to take her out of her carseat. I do admit I may have said it harshly to not remove baby from their carseat until first responders got to us. The car was not on fire and we weren't in any mortal danger. \n\nOn a normal day anytime my baby gets to the point of hysteria I soothe them, hug them, rock them, etc. That was a once in blue moon occurrence I didn't. I kept trying to shush and soothe baby from the seat but obviously she was scared and wanted her mama to hold her. \n\nAt the hospital both my friend and I got the all clear and we were waiting on baby to be cleared, my friend went off on me telling me I'm a bad mom for not removing baby from the carseat. I simply explained to her, it was better for baby to stay in the seat incase there was spinal damage, the seat keeps the spine aligned and removing the baby from the carseat would cause further injury if there was already one. \n\nShe kept berating me, I was frustrated already and I told her when she has her own and god forbid they get into a crash she can yank her kid out of the carseat and do as she pleases. She got quite and said I'm an asshole for bringing it up because she has trouble conceiving, she has PCOS,  and may not be able to carry a pregnancy to term.  \n\nIdt I'm the asshole for bringing up a hypothetical situation or I don't know if my frustration got the best of me and I was insensitive but AITA for making that statement?\n",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nMy late husband died when my oldest daughter (Sofia) was 9 and my youngest daughter (Julie) was 2. Julie has zero memories of her biological dad. I started to date 4 years after his death and remarried 7 years later (Sofia was 16 and Julie was 9). Sofia wanted nothing to do with him and looking back was a dick to him. My husband (Jim) never tried to force Sofia to see him as a father figure, but Julie did see him as a father figure. She refers to him as Dad. Both girls have been to therapy, Sofia hated it and I actaully think it made the issue below worse. Julie like it and helped her overcome never knowing bio dad.\n\nThat was the main issue between Sofia and Julie, Sofia thought julie was abandoning and replaying their bio-dad.  Julie made it very clear that Jim is her dad and basically bio-dad doesn’t mean much to her since, she doesn’t remember him. Many fights and their relationship was strained. Therapy didnt help, separate and group were tried. \n\nIt got better when Sofia went off to college and they had space. Julie (24) is getting married. She announced this during dinner last Saturday and asked for Jim to give her away. Sofia did not take that well and started telling Julie that she was a horrible daughter and that she is replacing dad.\n\nThe announcement was ruined and Julie told her not to come to the wedding. I pulled Sofia aside and told her that she needs to apologize to her sister for her outburst, that she is way too old for this and it is time for her to grow the fuck up. That is fine that she doesn’t see jim as her father but get over that her sister does. \n\nShe was crying when I finished, told me it is my fault for getting remarried in the first place and had not contacted me since. I know she apologized to Julie but she won’t respond to any of my texts.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSameish question being asked, her is one of my comments answering it\n\n\"No, he never forced himself to be a father figure. Bio dad stayed very alive in memory after my wedding, he wasnt hidden. He still got mentions and story all the time, he was celebrated on his birthday and so on\n\nNo grave visiting because he is cremated and is on the fireplace.\"",

      "scenario_description": "I (24M) have an identical twin. We're not close, but I thought we had basic mutual respect. That belief was tested.\n\nI grew up in a traditional Southern town & only began coming out in college, about five years ago. It's been slow, especially with family. But since moving to DC in '23 for school/work, I've felt more comfortable living authentically.\n\nAfter moving, I met my boyfriend (26M), & we've been together 2yrs. Over time, I've introduced him to friends and family when I felt safe.\n\nCut to Nov. '24: I was home for the holidays & told my twin & his fianceé about my bf. They seemed happy for me. While staying with them, wedding details arose, & they asked if I'd be bringing a date. I said yes, my bf. My twin had gone to bed, but his fianceé said, \"While there are pros and cons, it's up to you if you want to bring him.\" That felt like a green light. My twin constantly deferred to her on decisions, so I didn't think I needed to double-check.\n\n5 months passed, my bf & I had spent $1,300 on travel (flights, hotel, etc.). 3 weeks before the wedding, I mentioned on a call with my brother that we were all set. His tone shifted: \"Oh, is BF actually coming?\"\n\nI reminded him of the convo with his fianceé. He said she never gave me permission & accused me of making it up. Then said, \"We can't allow your bf to come. We worry how Dad's side will react.\"\n\nI offered to call Dad on the spot. He dodged, saying he'd check with his fianceé (despite just saying it was his decision.) An hour later, no change. I was still invited-ALONE, still expected to buy a groomsman-match suiting (even though I wasn't in the party), & show up smiling.\n\nThat's when I snapped. I asked, \"If I didn't invite your fianceé to my wedding, would you still come?\" He couldn't answer & ended the call after some harsh words. \n\nTrying to make things right, I came out to my dad (which I feared for years) to explain the situation. He was surprisingly indifferent & even said uninviting my bf was extreme. He offered to talk to extended family. I thought I was removing the main obstacle. \n\nWeeks later, my twin called again. He now claimed our friends would be \"weirded out\" (So the excuse shifted) I said, \"If my bf's not invited, I'm not coming.\" He didn't budge.\n\nHere's the kicker: days later, my dad told me the fianceé admitted she did give me permission but changed her mind when she remembered \"who would be there.\" She denied this to my twin. Also, one of her bridesmaids is openly gay and brought her gf, but, according to the fianceé, \"she's not part of the family,\" so it's different.\n\nSo I didn't go. I'm still wondering if I made the wrong call. My absence was noticed. I got texts asking where I was. My mom had to explain it repeatedly. So instead of avoiding attention, my absence became the story. My relationship with my twin is dead, & some family ties now feel fragile.\n\nPart of me wonders, should I have sucked it up & gone solo, just to preserve bonds that shaped my early life?\n\nSo, AITA for skipping the wedding?",
