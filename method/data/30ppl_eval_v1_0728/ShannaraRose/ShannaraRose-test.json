      "scenario_description": "So my boyfriend (31M) invited me to dinner with his old college group. One of his female friends (30F), who I’ve never met before, came late, looked me up and down, then said, “Ohhh so *you’re* the current one. Cute.”\n\nI was stunned. No one laughed, no one corrected her. My boyfriend just kind of chuckled awkwardly and changed the subject. I sat there in silence for another 20 minutes before excusing myself and leaving. I took an Uber home.\n\nHe called me later and said I embarrassed him by “making it a thing” and that I should’ve just “been chill” because “she didn’t mean anything by it.” He wants me to apologize to her for walking out “like a child.”\n\nAITA for not tolerating that kind of blatant disrespect?",

I’ve been working with my therapist and although I’ve improved a TON, I still drink a little every day. \n\nI’ve never been to AA, as I haven’t found a group that completely cuts out the religious aspect (the southern US, what can ya do) but as I said I’ve worked a LOT with my therapist, so I’m not trying to do this by myself. My friends & family are aware & supportive. \n\nSo, I don’t know if it’s just the shame/guilt/trauma talking, but if I still drink 1-2 drinks almost every day, do I need to disclose this to a stranger that might move into my apartment? \n\nETA: i don’t think I should live with someone who drinks heavily, so I would want to know this info. However it’s very personal so I don’t know if I would be an AH for wanting to know beforehand either? \n\nIt seems like a thin line between being invasive and also being important info for someone you live with to be aware of\n\nETA2: i don’t know how you get diagnosed as an alcoholic other than recognizing unacceptable behavior while drinking. My abusive ex is the only one that ever called me an alcoholic, and I do not take that accusation lightly, so I have been treating my unhealthy habits as addiction. \n\nI have gone 1-2 days without drinking, or even wanting a drink recently. It’s a new development to not want a drink, but I would rather treat this as alcoholism than act like I don’t have a problem at all",

      "scenario_description": "Okay, so I recently talked to my mom about feeling like I shouldn’t have to clean the house every day, and that my family should be able to clean some things up on their own. This made her surprisingly upset— surprisingly because this conversation was me trying to problem solve how we could make our house less of a daily problem, things like throwing away your own trash, washing your dish off once you use it, putting your towels in the laundry basket, etc... SIMPLE things that everyone should do as I don't really think it's fair I'm spending my entire summer cleaning up other people's messes. \nBoth of my parents work from 7am-4pm EST, so my mom asks me to clean while they’re gone. This isn’t a problem considering I don’t have a job right now, and I live under their roof. Doing laundry, sweeping, mopping, vacuuming, even painting the kitchen walls, I'll do it. I think my problem is that I get tired of people creating a mess for me to clean every day when I'd like to have some of the summer to myself, as well. Leaving food around on plates, dirty towels on the bathroom floor, piss on the toilet seat, crumbs on the stove— things I really, really think should be easy to handle quickly and easily instead of having me make my rounds. I know these things are small, but I get yelled at and called lazy when I don't clean these things up. \n\nSo... AITA??? I really don't know.\n\nFAQ??: \nTook me awhile to figure out how to edit this, but important details I've been asked.\n1.) I'm 17, and going into my senior year.\n2.) My brother is 12, my only sibling, and doesn't help as my parents don't discipline him for these things. \n3.) I take care of everything in the house while my parents work, including reminding my brother to take care of himself, cooking, and making sure our dogs are good during the day. \n4.) I am actively trying to get a summer job, but live in a small town where most things are locally owned, out of my way, or aren't willing to hire more people because they're locally owned. My options are pretty slim. I've been trying to sell some things like old clothes online to have some money in my pocket, which is as close as I am currently to being employed. ",

      "scenario_description": "My 19F friend Carrie 19F was one of my good friends starting in college. We lived on the same dorm floor with my other friends and we formed a group pretty quickly. Carrie and I would go out together frequently, and we became closer. During our friendship I will say I received information from some of our other friends that she was saying some not so nice things behind my back like: “I don’t understand how she pulls guys she’s so weird” and once even said she would have sex with a guy I was talking to at the time. Fast forward into the school year, and about 8 failed talking stages later, she finally scored a boyfriend. Her boyfriend lived in our neighboring colleges apartment complex. She ended up basically moving in with him, and we never saw her. We attempted to get her to join us for group plans, or even just show up for dinner, but she’d always tell us no or that she was busy. My other friends and I planned a girls trip towards the end of the school year with all 6 of us (not including Carrie) this was partially because I had absolutely no more space in my condo for anyone else, and I hadn’t spoken to this girl in probably two months. At the end of the year, during finals, her boyfriend moved out and went back to his hometown. She was forced to be back at the dorm and all of a sudden started hanging with us again. I wasn’t a fan of this but I remained cordial. We didn’t tell her about the trip we’d planned because we knew she would be upset so it was kept under the table. She ended up finding out about it while we were on the trip and sent me a passive aggressive text asking when she could drop some of the stuff I’d let her borrow off. I told her I was away and she responded with “i know yall are at the beach can i just have your address to drop it off sometime soon and be done with this.” This struck a little bit of anger within me because not only had she been a shitty friend but we also hadn’t seen her recently at all. It became a back and forth argument over text of me explaining why I had done what I did and her deflecting and acting like a victim. She claims that we ganged up on her and that I’m the asshole.

      "scenario_description": "At the beginning of this year, I found out BIL got married and he was moving near us. I told him rent is pretty expensive so I wouldn’t recommend it. However he said it’s all good because his wife will help pay for rent until his finds a job. Fast forward a month, my wife tells me he’s about to sign a 2.5k a month lease for 12 months for a 3 bedroom apartment. I told her financially, it was a bad idea considering he doesn’t have a job and they could find something cheaper and wtf you need 3bed rooms for?. BIL once again says he’s good and his wife agreed to pay rent when they both signed the lease. \n\n\n\nJust yesterday my wife’s tells me he needs help paying rent for this month. Turns out he only had money for the first two months for rent. So he asked his wife to help and she apparently refused. So I said ok well then they both will get evicted. It was causal talk until my wife dropped the hammer….turns out apparently BIL wife is blackmailing him to pay all the rent regardless if he has a job or not. Wife and I don’t know what the black mail is and BIL won’t tell us. Then my wife asked if I could help him pay rent. I said: \n\n“After my repeated advise was ignored, if your brother was hanging on a cliff and I was on the edge of the cliff and I had a pocket full of fucks and he only need one to be saved, I WOULD NOT GIVE A SINGLE FUCK” \n\nAfter reflecting later, I realized that comment was a bit harsh but idk. I was just furious at the situation, I was raised to be very mindful of my financials and this is not the first time he’s asked for money. Whenever we go out, I’m always paying. I do not expect it back, but there’s no way I can lend him 2.5k for poor decisions he’s made. \n\nI’m afraid my refusal will put my marriage in jeopardy because of BIL\n\nWhat do I do ? \n\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 31F and my mom (Brenda, 55F) and I are honestly pretty close. But there’s this one thing she does that’s been getting under my skin for years. Basically, if I tell her anything about my life, she’ll go and talk about it with the whole extended family. Like... everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins, even random relatives I barely know or haven’t seen in forever. Nothing’s too small—she’ll mention stuff about who I’m seeing, stuff with my job, health stuff, money stuff... just everything.\n\nI’ve told her to stop doing that so many times. Like I’ll say “hey, I don’t want anyone else knowing about this,” and she’ll nod like she gets it—but then later I hear she’s been talking. And when I call her out, she always says something like, “Oh, come on, it’s just family!” or “I wasn’t gossiping, I was just chatting.” Like??? That doesn’t really make it better.\n\nAnyway, not long ago I had this minor medical thing done—nothing serious, but definitely personal. I told her ahead of time, super clearly, that I didn’t want anyone else knowing. Just wanted to keep it to myself.\n\nThen like three days later, I start getting these “how are you feeling??” texts from a bunch of my aunts. And yep—turns out my mom told them. Again.\n\nI was honestly so frustrated. I called her and told her straight up that I felt like she didn’t respect my privacy, and that I was hurt she went and told people again after I asked her not to. I told her I need her to stop sharing my life like that—it’s not just casual chatting when it’s stuff I asked her to keep private.\n\nShe got really upset. Said I was attacking her, said I was overreacting and being cold, and now she won’t talk to me. My dad says I should’ve handled it “more gently” and that I made her feel bad. So now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far.\n\nWas I the asshole for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "I love my niece, and I support her creative expression. I’ve told her that she could make me a dress for running around the house, running errands, hanging out, etc. I’m happy to wear something she’s made at times where it’s appropriate. I’ve worn the acrylic scarf she crocheted me for a few years now and it’s not because it looks good.\n\nShe uses youtube and tiktok tutorials, so she doesn’t know how to work off patterns, make tailoring adjustments, choose the right fabric, etc. On tiktok and other social media spaces the “cool” thing to do is announce that you made your garment from a ratty thrifted sheet using an old pair of shorts you had lying around. Sometimes it looks good, sometimes it doesn't. But she doesn’t take the time to do things like pressing or finishing steams, trimming or sewing in ends, etc. When I’ve suggested it to her, she said it’s more authentic the way she does it.\n\nShe begged me to do an outfit for an event I have coming up where I’ll be on stage. I tried to let her down gently and said that I had a dress being tailored as we speak. She said I could wear that one to something else, but that I should wear something she made because it would be special and a bonding experience for us. Everyone in my family is obsessed with “bonding experiences.” Everything has to be a bonding experience between the adults and kids. It’s exhausting.  I reiterated my no, saying “No, I do not want you to make me anything.” \n\nHer mom (my sister in law) is telling me that I care way too much about my appearance and my image. This is an event related to my career. The last thing I need to do is walk up on stage in something that doesn’t fit, or looks like it was made with a sheet. And especially because I am plus sized, how I look is judged more harshly.\n\nSIL complaining about me being superficial is not new. I dared to buy ONE designer bag for myself and she did the whole thing you see on Reels, the whole “STUPID! I would just thrift a bag and put the rest of my money IN the bag!” bit. I was briefly engaged and she would not shut up about how I supposedly wanted a wedding, not a marriage because I dared to want to pick out my own decor and not just use whatever she could scrounge up on Marketplace or get for sale at the craft store.\n\nMy career is the most important thing in the world to me right now. Obviously for my SIL, her child is the most important thing in the world to her. But am I correct to put my career ahead of her child’s feelings, or do my values automatically make me the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "I (32F) feel stuck between my husband (34M) and my family, and I don’t know if I handled this the right way.\n\nMy brother (30s) has always been the golden child in my mom’s eyes. He has several kids but barely parents them. My mom (60s) watches his children constantly while he sleeps, plays video games, or just disappears. Any time someone brings up how unfair this is, she makes excuses like “he’s just tired” or “he’s doing his best.” He rarely shows up to help, and everyone is expected to tiptoe around it.\n\nRecently things got worse. My husband owns his own business and works hard to provide for our family. After a dumb disagreement with my brother, my brother actually threatened my husband’s business. Like straight-up said he’d mess with it. Not even in a joking way.\n\nThen, he demanded my husband return the furniture we had bought and given him. This was stuff we purchased to help him when he was going through a tough time. It wasn’t a loan. It was a gift. But suddenly he was acting like we owed him something.\n\nSo yeah - my husband got mad. He made a comment about how my brother doesn’t do anything, never helps with his own kids, and how my mom constantly enables him. It was honest. Maybe a little harsh, but not inaccurate.\n\nI didn’t say anything. I didn’t defend my brother because honestly, my husband was right. I’ve felt that way for years but always kept quiet to avoid drama.\n\nLater, my mom pulled me aside and told me I should have stood up for my brother. She said I let my husband “disrespect family” and accused me of changing since I got married. She made me feel like I betrayed them by not taking my brother’s side.\n\nNow I feel completely torn. My husband is working hard, doing his part, and constantly getting disrespected. But my mom acts like I should cover for my brother no matter what.\n\nSo, AITA for not defending my brother when my husband called him out?\n\n\nEDIT- seeing a lot of people thinking I didn’t defend my husband, I left that part out bc I didn’t need judgement on if I was TA for doing that. My family and I haven’t spoke since this happened and I definitely had a screaming match with my mother after this happened. ",

I usually don’t ever engage in that game with women. I genuinely thought she was in her 50s. Drinks had been flowing and I guess I lost my better judgment and I guess (what I think is lowballing) 41. She is shocked and grabs her friend to tell her oh my god she said 41!! She tells me her age. Shes 37. Im mortified. She says “Do I really look that old?!?? I know I have wrinkles!” And I said “Oh god Im so sorry no no youre beautiful” Her friend says “I always say 21 no matter what”. I walk away from that situation feeling uncomfortable and really horrified. The rest of the night that woman and I ignore each other. To be honest, she was a rough looking 37…  I didn’t even think it was that bad to have guessed within 5 years.. I also think like if you look old don’t ask people to play that game.

      "scenario_description": "I (26M) was at a crowded park recently where there were food trucks set up and people sitting around eating. Seating was pretty limited, and most people were sitting on this low concrete wall that runs along the edge of a parking lot. On the other side of the wall is a grassy area that's level with the top of the wall, so people sit with their backs toward the grass and legs facing the lot.\n\nI had just gotten my food when I noticed the only free spot left. At the same time, I saw a girl, well dressed for the park also walking toward it. She saw it first and was headed that way, but I was closer and got there before her despite her running when she saw me approaching it.\n\nAs I got to it, I looked down at the grass behind the wall and saw a big pile of dog poop right where someone’s lower back or clothes would land if they leaned or sat back. It was pretty gross, and I decided not to sit.\n\nRight then, she walked up and looked annoyed, saying, “Seriously? I was going to sit there.” I didn’t want to make a thing of it, so I just stepped aside and said, “Go ahead, you can have it.”\n\nShe immediately sat down without checking behind her and just a second later jumped up with a disgusted look on her face. The poop was stuck to the back of her skirt. She turned to me and snapped, “Why didn’t you say anything?”\n\nI told her, “I saw it, yeah, but I didn’t know how you were planning to sit. For all I knew you were just going to perch on the edge or sit upright. It’s a park — people walk their dogs here. You’ve got to check before sitting down.”\n\nShe kept insisting I should’ve warned her, but I told her I wasn’t trying to be petty, I genuinely didn’t know how far back she was going to lean or sit, and it wasn’t really my responsibility to check the ground for her. She could have sat only on the wall and not on the grass and would have been fine.\n\nShe eventually walked off frustrated, but now I’m wondering if I should’ve just said something anyway. But I feel like especially since she was so confrontational about the spot it wasn't really necessary.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (19 m) live at home with my parents. For context, all bedrooms in the house are barely 20 feet from the living room tv. My entire problem is that my step mom will watch the living room tv incredibly loud. Loud enough that I can hear the conversation clearly with my door closed. \n\nMy problem is that the tv definitely has the capability to be listened to comfortably without bothering people upstairs because both me and my dad have used it in that range, and he is hard of hearing. My mom never does anything else either. She is either at work, or watching tv all day on the living room. Both me and my dad have told her that the tv is too loud especially at night (sometimes up to 2 am) when she stays up late watching scenes with explosions, shouting, and gunshots. \n\nNow, for the part that might make me the AH. I absolutely despise these kinds of sounds. I don’t watch live action content because of it. It makes me deeply uncomfortable. I hate loud noises and they scare me, and my parents openly know and acknowledge this at times. Other times my dad tells me I’m being over dramatic and to suck it up. I often stay in my room with my door closed and headphones in, trying to ignore everything that’s going on down there but it’s just so loud. (I have sensitive ears) \n\nThis all came to a head one day while I was trying to take a nap due to a migraine, and my mom was watching a particularly loud part of the handmaids tale. I had the door closed and had soft music playing to try and drown it out, but to no avail. I stepped out of my bedroom and asked her to turn the tv down, or move to her bedroom where the tv is quieter. (yes, that’s how close it is.) She refused so I (being sick out of my mind) I raised my voice. Not by much, but I don’t raise my voice ever so I am not surprised it didn’t go over well. I told her: “you have perfectly normal hearing and you don’t need the tv this loud. I have a migraine and you are making it hard to sleep. Please turn the tv down.”\n\nApparently this was the wrong move as now both my dad and mom are yelling at me for “having an attitude.” I feel this is unfair as I never raise my voice and do my best to stay out of their way. (I don’t have the money to move out yet) \n\nTLDR: I raised my voice a bit above normal because I had a migraine and the tv was loud. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (19F) have a stepmom. let’s call her Sheila. She’s not mean, we get along fine, and honestly, she can be really nice. We’ve had good moments. But deep down, I still resent her. And not in the usual “evil stepmom” kind of way.\n\nBefore I was born, Sheila and my dad were together in their early 20s. I don’t know the full story, but it was abusive. Bad enough that Sheila literally ran away to Florida to escape him and cut contact completely.\n\nFast forward to when I was in 6th grade. I was with my grandma (who practically raised me), and we randomly ran into Sheila at a store. I didn’t know who she was, but she told my grandma that she had just seen my dad a few days earlier, and they’d exchanged numbers. She asked if she should reach out. My grandma told her not to since my dad was already dating someone else.\n\nWell, a few weeks later, I met Sheila for the first time, and shortly after, she was living with us. Eventually, we moved into her house about 30 minutes away from where I grew up. After that, whenever they fought (which was often), she’d kick us out. I got kicked out of the house with my dad twice, and one time she just kicked him out and let me stay, but it was super uncomfortable. Each time she kicked him out, she also filed a restraining order on him.\n\nHere’s why I resent her: she knew who he was. She experienced his abuse firsthand. She had already escaped him once. But she still chose to get back with him, and by doing that, she brought all that chaos back. not just into her life, but into mine. I was still a kid. I didn’t choose this. But I’ve had to deal with cops at the house, screaming matches, being kicked out, instability. all because she decided to give him another chance.\n\nI know abusive relationships are complicated. I know manipulation is real. But this wasn’t the first time. This wasn’t someone who didn’t know better. She knew exactly who he was—years before I was even born. And now I’m the one dealing with the consequences of her decision to come back.\n\nShe’s nice to me, yeah. But I can’t pretend like that makes it okay. I feel like my life would’ve been so different if she had just walked away that day in the store. And I hate that I think that.\n\nAITA for resenting her, even though she never directly hurt me?\n\nEDIT: just want to clear something up, because a lot of the responses are saying I’m “blaming the abused instead of the abuser,” and that’s not what I’m trying to do at all. To be 100% clear: I do hold my father responsible for everything he’s done. He is absolutely the root cause of the abuse and chaos. I’m not excusing him in any way. I’ve lived with him. I know how bad he is, and I’ve never once seen him as anything other than the main source of the problem. That said, this post wasn’t about him. This was about my feelings toward my stepmom specifically, someone who re-entered his life (and mine) after already having firsthand experience of what he’s capable of. She’s not the abuser, but her choices did have serious consequences for me, as a child caught in the middle.\n\nEDIT 2: this isn’t about blaming her for the abuse. he’s fully responsible for that. My issue is that she came back to him after 20+ years, knowing how bad things were back then, knowing he was already in a relationship, and even after being warned by his own mother not to get involved with him again. She still made the conscious decision to reinsert herself into his life, disrupt his current relationship, and be with him. He’s at fault too, obviously. but this post is about her choice to come back despite everything. Everyone under this post seems to believe that being a victim excuses you from also being partly to blame.",

You know who he is, too. \n\nNTA, but heaping the majority of your anger on the abuser rather than (one of the) victims is pretty twisted.

      "scenario_description": "My sister (32F), Olive, has been very demanding and disorganized since getting engaged this past April. At first, she said she never wanted a wedding—just a courthouse marriage. Then she said she was getting married in September. Her plans changed every time we spoke: courthouse, then church and reception, then back to courthouse, then church with 20 guests, and now a church ceremony followed by a banquet hall for 100 people.\n\nShe originally said she didn’t want any events before the wedding. Then out of nowhere, she was having a bridal shower that she claimed her fiancé’s sister would contact me to help plan. No one reached out. Instead, I was sent an invite that was already fully planned by Olive and the sister. I thought it was rude but kept it to myself. The invite instructed guests to send $60 directly to Olive to RSVP. My mom called me saying she had an issue with how Olive was planning, and I agreed—but I always maintained that it was Olive’s wedding and she could do as she pleased.\n\nAbout a month ago, Olive sent out wedding e-invites with an RSVP deadline in August. Less than 24 hours later, she texted me multiple times demanding why my fiancé and I hadn’t RSVP’d. I was confused—why the urgency if the deadline wasn’t for weeks? I asked her, but she read the message and never replied.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my mom called asking why I hadn’t RSVP’d. She said Olive had been ranting that “as my sister, she should be the first to RSVP!! This is bullshit!!” I was frustrated. 1) It was obvious I’d attend. 2) Olive could’ve asked me directly. 3) My fiancé and I were waiting to confirm time off work. My mom also said Olive blamed me for not helping plan the shower. I was angry because I had no contact with the groom’s sister and the shower was already planned without me.\n\nToday, Olive called and texted several times. When I called her back, she said my mom told her I had a problem with the $60 RSVP. I told her I did but also said it’s her wedding and I’d RSVP for the shower when I got paid, and the wedding once we sorted out work. She accused me of giving “weird energy” and not acting like a proper sister. I told her we can’t drop everything for her wedding and that I wasn’t even included in the planning. She said she give a fuck if my fiancé came and that I should’ve RSVP’d right away. When I explained we needed to confirm our work schedules, she said I should just call in sick or not show up. I told her I wasn’t doing that and got upset she’d even suggest it. She started screaming and calling me “fucking stupid,” so I ended the call.\n\nNow, my mom is calling me on three-way with Olive, and I’m refusing to answer. AITA?",

For some reason she brought up how upset I was on my 15th birthday for not getting an N64 game. And then admitted she went out and bought a game after seeing how disappointed I was. Which was news to me, because later that day my mother and sister presented me with an N64 game, and basically said \"Here! We didn't give it to you earlier because we just wanted it to be a joke!\" Then told me I was being a big baby about it. Which admittedly I was. But I'd actually talked a lot for months leading up to my birthday how I'd wanted an N64 game. And didn't even ask for a new one. There was a Game Crazy two miles away with a bunch of them used for very fair prices. I was very grateful for the game, and was playing it immediately.\n\nMy mother suddenly admitted earlier that she only got me clothes on that birthday because I'd had a sudden growth spurt, and was not only needing clothes, but I was looking more like an adult. She pointed out where she'd gotten the clothes, and how good they were. I rebutted that the clothes were good, but I'd literally only asked for one thing back then, which was an N64 game called Extreme G, specifically the first one. Which was far from new at the time. She claimed she ran out and bought the game brand new for $50, but I pointed out I knew exactly where she'd bought the game, exactly what game it was, and how it'd come out several years prior, and she bought for about $20 at most. She tried to refute it, but I knew the details of the where, when and how from back then so well, that she diverted to trying to say teenagers loved new clothes, and my sister was jealous. I told her that when I was in high school, I didn't know a single person in my age group that was happy only for clothes on their birthdays. \n\nI told her I was in no way ungrateful for the clothes back then. But it felt like the one little thing I'd wanted that day was completely disregarded. Then I pointed out how much stuff my nephews get for their birthdays from all of us. My mother tried to claim it was a different time. But my 15th birthday was in 2001. Gameboys were on every corner back then. And the next gen of home game consoles was incoming, if not there already. I told my mother wasn't asking for her to apologize or anything. I was just saying that's how I felt at the time, and she never really saw the situation from my side. I even agreed I was a brat about it. But in the end, all we could do was agree to disagree. I don't want to say I was hung up on it, but I also wasn't the one who brought it up. \n\nNow I'm feeling guilty for arguing about something from nearly 25 years ago. AITA for doing that?",

      "comment_text": "NTA - or if you are, so is she for bringing it up 24 years later.  Apparently she still feels guilty for wanting you to be an adult and want adult things instead of a 'game'.\n\nAgreeing to disagree sounds like the best thing to do.  She meant well by giving you clothes which you needed, and many parents don't even do that.  However, you have a right to be disappointed, especially when it seems like it wasn't finances that caused her to get only what she wanted you to have.  \n\nBringing it up two decades later and debating it seems like ... an odd thing to obsess over.  If she does it again, I'd just say something like \"Yeah, I remember,\" and change the subject.  Instead maybe bring up something she got you on some other holiday that you liked or when she did something special for you and let her know that those things matter more.",
