      "scenario_description": "To preface this, I do commissioned artwork, and don’t discriminate against any subject unless it’s racist, homophobic, otherwise hateful, or sexually disturbing…\n\nI did a commissioned art piece with Christian iconography, a beautiful ornate cross, a saint, and scripture in calligraphy.\nThe client was happy with my work, paid me, and then…asked me what my favorite scripture was. I was honest and just said “oh I don’t really have one, because I’m not a Christian and wouldn’t really know which ones I’d like.”\n\nHe became upset and told me that he felt lied to, because I have posted artwork of Christian subjects before, and he assumed I would be Christian. He said the art doesn’t hold the same spiritual value, because it wasn’t made with “faithful intention”.\n\nI was kind of unsure of what to say. I said “I’m sorry you feel that way, but I do artwork for everyone, and I am open to doing Christian artwork because it’s for the client, not me.”\n\nShould I be disclosing if I don’t share a certain faith when commissioned to do artwork for it? AITA?\n",

Think like hiding evil/unhinged phrases in Latin and Yiddish instead of the original prayer, or chosing to put a distorted version of a symbol instead of the actual symbol. \n\n\nThat being said, this makes it really important for people to actually vet their artists if they're choosing religious pieces. As long as you're not intentionally pretending to be Christian, you're not intentionally distorting things, and the pieces you create are beautiful and what people are asking for for, you're NTA. ",

      "scenario_description": "My mom's asking me to go vegetarian or at least stop eating red meat for 30 days as a birthday gift. She's been vegan for years and I've never had an issue with it. I try things she makes and a lot of the food is good. She decided to go vegan for moral reasons, and later also for her health since things had come up that required the diet change anyway so it was great timing for her. However, in the very beginning (when i was a teenager) she was extremely pushy about me giving up animal products and would try to get me to feel guilt for eating animal products from watching videos of how they are slaughtered. This didn't go well and we butted heads A LOT. Years later, I'm an adult now and we have stopped the fights over it and we live our lives the way we want. I'm not the kind of person who eats meat every day for every single meal, but it is part of my preferred diet. She would make comments here and there that would insinuate her trying to encourage to give up meat if a specific meal didn't agree with me or simply me just expressing how much I prefer fish over any other meat. I feel this might be a touchy subject for me because of her pushy behavior in the past and I immediately want to reject the request, but now I am feeling guilty. It's not nessarily a difficult task but it would take a lot of mindfulness on my part, changing how I grocery shop and deny certain things I would otherwise enjoy. I personally don't think this is a fair request because she is essentially trying to control what i eat and knowing my mother, this is her buy in to try to get me to stop meat entirely and will severely disappoint her in the end that I don't change my mind about eating meat, which will cause tension. WIBTA if I refuse this request?\n\nEdit/Update:\n\nTo answer a few questions, no I don't live with my mom anymore. I have been living on my own for awhile now.\n\nNo, my mom isn't some crazy vegan who calls everyone animal abusers. She is just super passionate about it and can have her extreme moments sometimes, but we have a fairly good relationship otherwise and I love my mom, so please be respectful with your comments about her.\n\nI did try to be vegan for a short time for health concerns at the suggestion of my mother when I was constantly having stomach issues, and I had a really hard time with it. I know i dont need to eat meat everyday all day and I don't, but that doesn't mean I wanna give up the foods that I like to indulge in every so often. Especially since my experience trying to be vegan was not positive. I was micro managing every little thing I ate and had so much trouble finding things within my budget and my schedule that I wasnt getting the proper nutrients I needed. I became tired and irritable all the time and it felt like my health was worse. Again, I probably didn't do it correctly, but I just did not have it in me to keep trying. I had other shit going on and this was not something I felt worked for me. Of course my mom was upset saying she didn't think I gave it a good chance (I had done this for nearly two months) and I was just making excuses cuz I wanted to eat meat. I didn't care and she eventually got over it. \n\nFor those wondering, I got tested for a lot of shit and was able to figure out certain allergies and intolerance I have, which helped me make adjustments in my daily life and am better/healthier.\n\nFor the update, there really isn't much to say. She tried to convince my sister of this too and bickered a bit about it as my mom wasnt happy with her initial no before my sister agreed to eating just white meat for a bit since she is on her on health diet anyway, but she is also not opposed to just lying to her if she slips up. My sister and I joked about it a bit as we understand our mom can be a bit dramatic sometimes.\n\nI however told my mom bluntly I wasnt interested in making this change and was an unfair request on her part. I sent my response to her AFTER she talked to my sister, so I never got a reply back. We haven't seen or talked to each other yet since both are busy but I'm going to assume she's moved on since she already went back and forth with my sister. Im sticking by my decision and dont expect her to push further, but we will see. Thanks everyone for your input on this matter.",

      "scenario_description": "My mum (56) has been dating a man (“Adam”) for 5 years. I’m 28F. They met online during COVID and said “I love you” within 3 weeks—before they’d even met in person. At the time, we had just gotten out of a 20+ year abusive home situation (our mum didn’t protect us—we got us all out), We’d encouraged her to date to stop her going back to dad, but the intensity of the relationship raised red flags.\n\nAdam is in his late 50s, never married, supposedly has a good job but nothing to show for it. I suspect he gambles, he watches every sport, every team, obsessively. He lives in England; we’re in Ireland.\n\nThere have always been red flags—subtle digs about my mum aging, calling her decisions “our” decisions but keeping his private. He makes no effort with family and isolates her. I think he’s using her and possibly planning to freeload off her divorce settlement.\n\nThe final straw was him watching football on his phone for 15+ minutes at my grandad’s funeral. I waited a few weeks to tell my mum. When I did, he denied it—she believed him over me.\n\nThings got tense. My sister 22F and I ended up in family therapy (without him) and agreed to one last conversation with Adam. We told our mum: if it went badly, she could keep seeing him, but she had to stop trying to involve us. It was a big deal—we were anxious and triggered by having to confront a man about his behaviour, given our past.\n\nThe conversation was awful. He said, “We’ll agree to disagree,” then admitted he “glanced” at his phone, then finally admitted to watching the match. Still—no apology.\n\nSince then (6 months ago), we’ve had no contact with him. I’ve told him I don’t want to speak to him again. Now my mum is saying we need to “fix things” and come for dinner to “sort it out.” She gets upset when we say no.\n\nI’m exhausted. I can’t control who she dates—but I won’t be around him. It’s stressful, triggering, and upsetting. Some people say we’re being “overly sensitive” due to cPTSD. But honestly, we’re too tolerant—we survived years of abuse. If we were fragile, we would’ve broken. We didn’t.\n\nNow I’m getting married next year. And I’m already heartbroken because my dad won’t walk me down the aisle—not because he’s gone, but because of what he did to us. That’s something I’ve had to grieve. But now it feels like another man in my mum’s life is going to ruin another major moment. My graduation, birthdays—those were all made miserable by my dad. And now it feels like my wedding could be overshadowed by another man she’s putting first. I just don’t understand how it’s unreasonable to want my wedding day to be about me—for once—not about managing someone else’s boyfriend.\n\nMy mum clearly thinks I’m the problem—that I’m being difficult and dramatic because of our past. And honestly, I’m starting to feel like I am the asshole. But deep down, I don’t think I am. I just feel like one for standing my ground.\n\nAITA for drawing this boundary and saying I don’t want to spend Christmas or my wedding with this man?\n\nEdit: my mum will definitely come to my wedding, we are actually really close and get on so well (apart from this drama) which is why it’s even more hurtful. When it’s not about men we have a really good relationship. It does feel more like a sister relationship - she’s honestly not a bad person, she is a great mum in lots of ways, she just makes really bad decisions with men that make it look that way. \n\nMy little sister has supported me and been there for me through everything - she’s who will walk me down the aisle we’ve been through everything together it’s only right ❤️ \n\nFurther edit: \nI have said to her about going No contact if she continues to force him on us and she feels this is me forcing her to break up with him and not letting her make her own decisions.

      "scenario_description": "I [18, F] have been having issues at home for years. I never seemed to grasp the concept of knowing \"good\" and \"bad\" people, because every year was the same; she [45, F] would blame any changes in behaviour on the people I chose to be around, without ever meeting them. No problem, that's fine, blame my behaviour on an autistic trait, and belittle me every time we argue for years to come, claiming I'm naive and too sensitive. I only let it slide for a couple years since I was young and none the wiser. A few years later, she got married to my stepdad [55, M]. This becomes relevant later.\n\nWhen I got to at an age where I had my phone on me half the time, it became \"But are you speaking to them over the phone? Hand it over, I'll block them for you.\" and every punishment that was served to me somehow linked to them. She was failing to recognise that the education system clearly was the problem, as it isn't built for a person like me, and so kept going back to the same excuse, stripping me of my support system every year. I had to fight for support MYSELF, in school, just so I was accommodated, and hope she didn't find out. She turned into one of those parents who deny their kids have anything wrong with them that isn't genetic, so won't push for a diagnosis.\n\nFast forward to November 2024, my 2nd year of college. I had just gotten out of a summer without having this conversation. But combine the stress of applying for university, constant assignments and pressure from all sides to do well, and I eventually broke. I was so good at hiding it that nobody suspected a thing. I decided last week to finally try to open up to both her and my stepdad, only for the same thing to happen again. Difference is – stepdad DIDN'T actually belittle me at all, but will agree with her words behind closed doors. \n\nI know my parents are supposed to be a part of my support system, but with one being against everything and the other being frustratingly neutral, there's nowhere to really go. That being said, AITA for keeping my mouth shut all now?",

So when I say \"don't share\" I mean *they have shown you who they are.* They *failed* you. \n\n\nIt is a parent's **job** to teach their kids things. If you were naive,  they should have helped you learn. If you were struggling, she had no business stripping away your support year after year. The reason you struggled to differentiate between \"good\" and \"bad\" people is because your mom is a \"bad\" person who *taught you* that she was \"good.\" It's not *quite* so cut and dry as laid out here, but that's the gist of it. They don't want to support you, they have actively interfered in support in the past, and so they should not be a part of your inner circle.  \n\n\nYou deserve so much more. Any success you achieve in life will be *in spite* of them, never *because* of them. Hang in there. ",

      "scenario_description": "Hi Reddit, first time posting and I need advice because I’ve been brooding over this and it’s really eating me up.\n\nEverything started back in January when my sister (25F) moved back home after breaking up with her boyfriend. They had adopted a cat together and fought over who’d keep it. She got a loan to pay her ex for his half. But that ended up being pointless because between her job, her social life, and trying to find a place, she realized she couldn’t care for the cat.\n\nWe (my parents, younger siblings, and I, 23F) all asked her to please let us know before giving the cat back so we could say goodbye. She agreed. Well, she didn’t. She waited until my parents and little sister were on a trip, I was at work, and only my brother was home. She just texted, “hey he is coming today to take the cat,” and didn’t even tell my brother, who was actually in the house.\n\nWe were hurt. My brother especially, since he really bonded with the cat. We talked to her, and she didn’t apologize. Just said, “It’s my cat, my life, I do what I want.” I told her that next time she should at least consider how her actions affect others.\n\nA few weeks later, Bad Bunny announced his Europe tour (we live in Spain). She was desperate to get tickets. I couldn’t afford to buy one, but I lent her my Ticketmaster accounts. She was aiming for two tickets for her and her ex (again). But she ended up buying four due to nerves. When she told me, I asked if I could have one. I said I’d pay her on payday and even drive her to the concert. She said she’d think about it people were offering double the price.\n\nNext day, she called and said she and her ex had fought and he wasn’t going. She asked if I still wanted the ticket. I said yes, but I’d have to pay her on the first. She said okay. My friends warned me she might sell it anyway, but I defended her. I didn’t think she’d do that to me.\n\nTwo weeks later, we went out to eat (me, her, and our mom). I brought up the ticket. She shook her head and said her ex paid her the day after we talked and she sold the others too, for €200–€300. I was stunned. I reminded her I was going to pay. She said, “I know, but I wanted more money.” That moment shattered me. She didn’t even really say sorry, just “sorry but” and excuses. I lost a lot of respect for her.\n\nIt’s been two weeks. No apology. I’m not even upset about the ticket anymore. What hurts is that she’s my sister and showed no loyalty. I’ve done so much for her (picked her up late after she broke up her ex, helped her move, paid for stuff she couldn’t afford, etc).\n\nNow, my mom and I were planning a summer dinner so I could introduce my boyfriend to the family. I said I didn’t want my sister there. My mom said if she’s not invited, she won’t do the dinner. I said if she comes, then I won’t. My boyfriend says we can just go and not engage, but I know my parents will be mad at me. My mom already said if it doesn’t happen, it’s my fault.\n\nWIBTA?",

It's unfortunately too common that the family will placate the selfish person and turn on their victim because it's just easier to pressure the victim to cave. It might be easier long-term to cave on this, but always expect your sister to stab you in the back, and refuse to do anything nice for her. *Or* if your family has a history of pressuring the person speaking up, it might be easier to tell the family if they take her side, then you're disowning them. Only you know what's better for you- but you need to think long-term and worst-case. ",

My husband is Jewish and I raised our children to be very in touch with their cultural identity (sent them to Jewish schools and sleepaway camps) but don’t really practice the religion in terms of keeping the Sabbath, following the dietary laws, etc.\n\nOur son is 19 and has, over the past two years, become pretty religious. He spends the Sabbath with friends, which is fine with us. We have tried to compromise on the dietary laws by purchasing kosher meat/poultry for him, not mixing meat and dairy, etc. we live in an area with a large Jewish community and he has cart blanche to use Apple Pay to buy himself whatever food he wants. \n\nBecause I grew up in the community I know the rules and do the best I can for him while not limiting myself to a culture that I chose to leave.\n\nI recently found out from one of my other kids that he is annoyed that we haven’t converted one of our ovens (we have two) into a kosher oven for his use, or purchased separate dishes for him etc.\n\nSibling was like “Did you ask Mom and Dad to do any of this?”\n\nSon was like “no, mom grew up with all of this so she definitely knows what I need and is choosing not to do it.”\n\nSibling pointed out he can’t be mad if he doesn’t ask while ALSO pointing out that Son is 19 and that this is our house and if he’s that pressed he can get his own place and do what he wants.\n\nFact is, I don’t want to. I cook and bake a lot. I like having two ovens. I don’t want to relive the exhaustion of a kosher (semi-kosher) kitchen, though I could.\n\nAITA for not accommodating my son’s religious beliefs to the best of my ability rather than a baseline level?",

      "scenario_description": "\nTitle:\nAITA for asking for a car back that I gave to my sister for free after she fixed it\n\nA while ago, I ( Phoebe, 25F) told my sister (Ursula  35F) she could have my car. It was a verbal agreement—I never signed over the title. Later, my lawyer told me I couldn’t just give it away like that since the car was still legally in my name and I’m currently going through a divorce with my ex husband (Joey 25M) . If anything happened, I would be responsible. So I reached out to try and fix things the right way.\n\nI offered to:\n\t•\tReimburse her for any parts or labor she’d paid for\n\t•\tGive her rides while she looked for a replacement, using the money I was offering\n\nI was trying to be fair. Instead, she told me: “Take me to court.”\nShe also allegedly told her ex, who’s a mechanic (Ross 36M) , to strip the car for parts. That was the breaking point for me.\n\nImportant detail: at this point, she couldn’t even legally drive the car because her license is suspended. So I was the one still liable for a car she legally couldn’t use.\n\nI was overwhelmed, upset, and in a bad financial spot. I was literally on my way to a pawn shop to sell my valuables just to pay for the car. On the way, I decided to stop at my Nanna’s house, hoping she’d hear me out. But instead, it felt like she had already taken Ursula’s side.\n\nShe told me to just let it go because “ Ursula needs it more—she’s going through a divorce and you have your boyfriend to help you.” Then she threw in the classic guilt trip: “Blood is thicker than water.” No one helped me during my divorce tho 🥴 not financially or emotionally, I was told “your doing such a great job you don’t need us”\n\nEventually, Ursula blocked me, and Nanna told her to unblock me. When she did, she told me she was “just treating me like a regular person” and that “this was just a bad business deal.”\nAt that point, I told her to keep it that way—and keep the car.\n\nThen I found out Ursula had lied to her ex Ross about the situation, and that’s why he threatened to strip the car—because he thought I was trying to screw her over. Her ex had called me saying that he was willing to help me with the car or get another one because no one else in my family would. He was the only person in my family with compassion this entire time. \nSo, AITA? \n\nUpdate: a day later \nIn the end, her ex gave the car back to me—but on a payment plan for the parts he put into it.\nThat was all I wanted from the start: to pay for the parts and keep things fair. On a payment plan we both agreed to and made up documents to hold both our end of the agreement for payment. Now, because of the lies Ursula told her ex, she won’t be getting the money from the car like she expected.\nAlso, I won’t be giving her rides anymore, which is the part I feel like the AH about. \n\nHopefully last update: two days later \nI took the car to get checked with a code scanner and drove it on the highway to make sure everything is fine and for the most part it is. When the car got to my house it was at night and I was frazzled and tired so I didn’t take that much of a look and in the morning I saw that the plastic for the brake drivers lights were broken as well as there being a huge dent next to it, and had some fresh mud marks of someone’s dirty shoes. There’s also the front headlight on the passenger side was just completely torn off.You wouldn’t have noticed unless you were looking for it. I’m not going to push the issue though. She was mad, I get it. Slapped some duct tape on it since the bulbs were working and will fix when I have time…and the money. I also forgot to mention that Ross said he was going to sell me another car and then showed up with my car lol…I wasn’t going to say no a third time.\n\n⸻\n\nUpdate – 3 Weeks Later:\nI know I said I hoped there wouldn’t be another update, but yesterday the cops had to be called because of Ross. I wanted to wait until I’d fully calmed down before writing this, because I wasn’t in the right headspace at the time.\n\nWhen Ross first gave me the car, he only gave me one key and said the other one was still at his house. (Yeah, I know—accepting that was dumb.) For a few weeks, I’d been asking him if he could either bring the other key or let me come get it, and he kept saying he was too busy with work. I tried to be understanding.\n\nThen he called and asked when I was going to finish paying him for the parts—just $200 left. I told him I had it right then and could give it to him if he brought me the other key. So I went to his house, and he handed me a different key, saying he had that one made because he “lost” the original. I didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t even the right key—my boyfriend had the original one Ross gave me.\n\nI called Ross to let him know, and he said, “Oh, my bad—I gave you the wrong one. I found it.” Like… seriously? So we met nearby (because my boyfriend was understandably pissed), and Ross gave me the correct key and both fobs.\n\nThen he starts telling me that my own family was saying I wasn’t going to pay him and spreading rumors that I cheated on my ex, Joey. I told him straight up: “Yeah, I cheated. I don’t lie. He abused me, and he deserved it. And I just paid you the rest, so what’s the issue?”\n\nRoss laughed and said, “If you ever find another reason to cheat, hit me up.”\nI told him, “Um… me and my boyfriend’s anniversary is next week, and I’m happy. No thanks.”\n\nOf course I went home and told my boyfriend. I begged him not to text Ross, but he did anyway—and sure enough, Ross showed up at our house. So we called the cops. He told them he wanted the car parts back and asked for the keys so he could take the car. The cop told him no and that he’d have to settle that in court.\n\nRoss ended up just taking the leftover parts he had left in the trunk. Then he tried to say he wanted the $600 battery and the headlights too. I told him no on the battery, but fine—take the headlights. Only because he said if I let him take those, we’d be done and he wouldn’t try to get any more money from me. In the end\nHe only took the headlights out and then asked if he could buy me new headlights, I obviously said f**k no. He’s now officially trespassed from my house.\n\nAbout an hour later, he called me again—said he’d gotten in a wreck on his way home and asked if I could come help him because he was drunk. I told him no, that my boyfriend would never allow that. Then I finally blocked him. The only reason I hadn’t earlier was because I’d been too upset, curled up in bed, and just didn’t think to do it.\n",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (31F) is staying with me temporarily after leaving her husband. I (30M) have a small apartment but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she’s six months pregnant. I wasn't very pleased about this situation but she is my sis afterall.\n\nThe main issue has been food. I’m pretty disciplined about what I eat because I am in bulk stage and hitting the gym regularly. I portion things, label them and plan for the entire week. But every other day something’s gone. Makes me crazy.\n\nShe’ll drink all my expensive shakes, polish off meals I’ve prepped for work, eat snacks I’ve saved for post run, and even finish leftovers I was planning to turn into new meals. When I bring it up, she shrugs and says things like “Cravings hit hard” or “Hormones” or \"You are being mean\".\n\nI asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. Or hell, manage her own food for god's sake. She refuses to do anything about it.\n\nSo last week I ordered a small mini fridge and set it up in my bedroom. It’s just big enough for my meal prep, snacks and drinks. I didn’t make a scene about it. I just quietly started putting all my stuff there.\n\nShe noticed two days later and got pissed. She said I was being “childish,” “dramatic” and “treating her like a thief.” I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights.\n\nNow she’s sulking and has told our parents after her failed marriage, her brother is also alienating her. And she is just a burden for everyone. My mom called and said I should “pregnancy isn’t easy” and especially for her situation.\n\nI don’t think I’m being cruel. I’m still letting her live here rent-free, and I’ve even offered to order food or cook together, but I just want my food to be left alone. A part of me understands she is going through trouble. But, at my expense?\n\nAITA?",

I get the impression that the bigger annoyance is that when you go to get your items they're gone and there's no apology. As a woman who had intense cravings,  I don't get why she wouldn't text a tearful apology after eating your carefully portioned servings.  I can't even fathom that level of entitlement.  NTA",

It happens often which is not ideal but whatever.

I told her not everyone lives by the Bible and she can’t keep preaching it while ignoring parts of it herself (she’s very judgmental, divorced etc which is fine\nbut hypocritical by her logic). She turned her head away, lifted her hand to eye level and said she wasn’t listening to me. I said that’s fine but I still get to say my piece.\n\nI then walked to the kitchen (next to the living room) and muttered “jeez fucking louise”. She asked what I said to her and I told her since she wasn't listening to me, I wasn’t talking to her. She called me \"fucking rude\" and I said yeah when it suits her. Now it's the silent treatment for me. \n\nAITA? I know I could’ve handled it better but I’m so tired of her using her beliefs to judge everyone. Even when I told her my childhood best friend had a baby recently, her first response was “that’s wrong, they’re not married.” I don’t expect her to change her beliefs, but why can’t she just let people live their lives without commenting?",

      "scenario_description": "So for context, I'm 16f, and he is 46m. I have a long name, for example, Anastasia, but I hate my name. I can acknowledge that it holds importance to my parents, so around relatives and guests, I let them introduce me as Anastasia, and the odd slip doesn't really matter that much. \nBut my dad is adamant that Anastasia is my name, and I should be addressed as such even when I've made it known that I dont like it. \nFor context, I ask them to call me Ana, and I introduce myself to new people as Ana. If you call me Anastasia, I might not respond simply because it doesn't register in my head. I've explained to both of my parents a thousand times why I prefer Ana. It's shorter, easier to say, and it feels more like me. \nWhen I was younger, say ages 5 to 13, I went primarily by Anastasia. However, at that time, I was also extremely anxious and in a very bad mental state. (I'm a lot better now, with therapy and medication, and I've managed to control my anxiety). \nBut being called Anastasia reminds me of that time of my life, which only adds to my dislike of the name. The name brings back lots of old feelings, and it just doesn't fit me anymore and hasn't for years. \nSometimes, my dad will call me Anastasia intentionally to make me upset. When we're at the dinner table, for example, he'll say things like \"please pass the salt Anastasia\" while giving me a look that makes me feel like he's trying to prove a point. The point he's trying to prove is that my legal name is Anastasia, and he doesn't have to call me anything else. \nEvery time he's done that, I've either redirected or just said \"Ana, dad\" while passing what he wants. \nHere's where i might be the jerk. Tonight, I was fed up. So I responded with \"Sure, George\" and passed him whatever he'd asked for. \nHe flipped out. He got very upset because I was being disrespectful, and I should never call him that again. I kept going and called him George (his legal name) a couple more times during that night. Additionally, he is adamant that \"Anastasia isn't your dead name, so i will continue to call you the name that i gave you.\" \nNow, my mom and him are saying I'm the jerk.  So Reddit, thoughts?\n\nEdit to add. My mom and dad do both call me primarily call me Ana. It's just that my dad and I have had this argument many times before, with me saying that Ana is what I prefer and he should respect that and him saying that it's not the name he gave me. My mom is of a similar opinion to him. However, she is less argumentative about it, and there are less conflicts. Whenever my dad and I fight about this, she always backs him. Additionally, I've made it known that I would be fine if he would rather call me Anya, Asia, Stacia, Annie, Stacy, literally any other variation or nickname for Anastasia or even my middle name. I understand that maybe his issue is with the name I've chosen, Ana, so I've offered him alternatives that don't force him to call me by a name he doesn't like and that doesn't force me to hear my full name. \nAs to the comments suggesting I legally change my name once I'm of age, I have considered it. At this point in time, I don't know what my actions going forward will be because the only person (people) who make a fuss about Ana are my dad and sometimes mom. I have also told my dad that I'm considering changing my name. Whenever I've said this, my entire family (dad, mom, brother) have basically called it stupid and said that I was being childish. \nTo those saying that this is how kids end up cutting off their parents, I dont see myself ever actually doing that. Despite this blip and the conflict, my dad is a generally amazing man who tries his hardest with what he's been given. I love him very much, and he's given me an amazing childhood. I'm just really getting frustrated with having to hear a name that I dont like nearly on the daily. \nI've expressed my opinion to him, and every time, it has gone over similarly. We've been having this argument at least weekly for at least a couple of years. \nI also did not claim to be trans. I am not transgender. I only made the comment of him likening Anastasia to being a dead name because he says it frequently. I am not trying to claim the struggles of the LGBTQ community or trans people. I hold immense respect for their struggles and successes, and i would never want to invalidate them by comparing our experiences. I only said that because my dad has made the comment multiple times, essentially trying to make the point to me that if I were transitioning then he would respect my name choice, but because it is just a preference of mine, it doesnt hold the same weight to him.\nThank you, everyone, for all the support and kindness in the comments, I greatly appreciate it. I hope you all have an amazing day!",

You're at an age where your parents should start preparing you for adulthood,  and part of what a *good* parent teaches is confidence and how to be assertive.  Your dad's behavior is worth putting distance between you and finding a mentor once you move out. \n\n\n>I let them introduce me as Anastasia \n\n\nStop doing that. I picked a different nickname around your age, and now I'm in my thirties and what has ended up happening is that *my* acquaintances meet my family/parents acquaintances and hear my childhood nickname and then they start calling me by *that* name because my family convinces them they're wrong. The only time they cross paths are at my wedding and my kid's baptisms.  It's a freaking headache because I've been my current nickname longer than my childhood nickname and my family \"feels disrespected\" when I correct them. ",

      "scenario_description": "Hi, Reddit. I’m 17 F, and I live with my aunt (66 F) because my mom died & my father (60) works abroad. My only sister (34 F) also works abroad, so it’s just us two.\n\nMy sister posted a photo of herself on Facebook. My aunt saw it, and told me “she got fat”. Knowing my sister doesn’t like her weight pointed out, I told her “Don’t say that. She doesn’t like that.”.\n\nShe then proceeded to: \n• Get angry at me \n• Say stuff like “your generation is so sensitive”, “I didn’t even intend to insult her and you think I’m capable of that”, & “You think YOU’RE always right?”\n• Sleep on the couch (the house only has 1 bedroom so we sleep in the same room)\n• Mutter words out of anger\n• Slam furnitures \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my aunt that she’s not supposed to point out things like that?\n\nEdit: The reason why I called her out on her words was because my sister wasn’t comfortable with terms like that or any comments about her body. I personally do not think of the word as an insult. \n\nEdit 2: She’s the healthiest she’s ever been (especially after leaving the country) & she’s very happy & beautiful. \n\nEdit 3: My intention was not to police my aunt with her language. My intention was to stop her from doing that & saying things like that repeatedly, because she’s comfortable with saying it to the family gc & to my sister directly. I’ve told her multiple times that my sister doesn’t like it, and she crashed out this time.",

      "scenario_description": "I (32F) feel stuck between my husband (34M) and my family, and I don’t know if I handled this the right way.\n\nMy brother (30s) has always been the golden child in my mom’s eyes. He has several kids but barely parents them. My mom (60s) watches his children constantly while he sleeps, plays video games, or just disappears. Any time someone brings up how unfair this is, she makes excuses like “he’s just tired” or “he’s doing his best.” He rarely shows up to help, and everyone is expected to tiptoe around it.\n\nRecently things got worse. My husband owns his own business and works hard to provide for our family. After a dumb disagreement with my brother, my brother actually threatened my husband’s business. Like straight-up said he’d mess with it. Not even in a joking way.\n\nThen, he demanded my husband return the furniture we had bought and given him. This was stuff we purchased to help him when he was going through a tough time. It wasn’t a loan. It was a gift. But suddenly he was acting like we owed him something.\n\nSo yeah - my husband got mad. He made a comment about how my brother doesn’t do anything, never helps with his own kids, and how my mom constantly enables him. It was honest. Maybe a little harsh, but not inaccurate.\n\nI didn’t say anything. I didn’t defend my brother because honestly, my husband was right. I’ve felt that way for years but always kept quiet to avoid drama.\n\nLater, my mom pulled me aside and told me I should have stood up for my brother. She said I let my husband “disrespect family” and accused me of changing since I got married. She made me feel like I betrayed them by not taking my brother’s side.\n\nNow I feel completely torn. My husband is working hard, doing his part, and constantly getting disrespected. But my mom acts like I should cover for my brother no matter what.\n\nSo, AITA for not defending my brother when my husband called him out?\n\n\nEDIT- seeing a lot of people thinking I didn’t defend my husband, I left that part out bc I didn’t need judgement on if I was TA for doing that. My family and I haven’t spoke since this happened and I definitely had a screaming match with my mother after this happened. ",

Given he doesn't support his own kids, he probably wouldn't support you after rendering you homeless.  **Family doesn't treat family this way.** \n\n\nBut you do need to take stock here- it isn't fair for your husband to risk everything just because you want to keep the peace.

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

Last August she turned down a PT job at a local school district that would have paid her 30% more than she currently brings home, currently brings home 65k could’ve made 85k.

She would have had all of the same breaks that I do as a teacher, I currently work at this same district that the job was at. \n\nBefore everyone attacks me, I am very familiar with how this job is. Her best friend wound up taking the position after she declined. I see her friend at my building sometimes rolling in close to 9 AM to start the day. I do realize that most of the patients she would see are on an IEP. But considering she sees patients now that are also difficult I am just super puzzled on the decision. One last thing, I have also gotten a weird feeling about her infatuation with her boss at her current job. He is married and has kids, seems like a nice guy. Ive never thought he seemed flirty towards her when Ive been around, but she does seem to hold him in such high esteem almost in a strange way. He is about 10-12 years older than both of us. \n\nLong story short, she turned down that job because she claimed she wouldn’t enjoy that type of environment for doing PT work. Here’s the part I really struggle with:\nMy wife is constantly stressed about working and juggling two kids, we are getting close to being financially able for her to work part time. However, she is constantly negative and very critical of me and others. We have to walk on eggshells around her. Any time we have an argument about chores or other household duties, she immediately attacks me with “you have more time off so you should do them all”. I agree, I do have more time off. I enjoy my schedule that allows me to be with my family more. I was previously in sales working weekends sometimes until 10pm often before having kids. I probably do about 95% of the dishes and cleaning and 70% of the laundry. I also do our finances and grocery store runs. I pick up the kids from daycare and drop them off frequently. Any time we get into an argument I really have to bite my tongue about her complaining about not having any free time, when she turned down that job, in my mind she forfeited the right to complain about not having free time. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Title should read; “Job with a dream schedule.”",

She needs to respect that you're working too, your doing everything because you have more time off isn't going to fix her problem of burning out.\n\n\nContempt/resentment are signs the relationship is ending. I'm in a bad marriage myself and looking back, I wish I had gotten couples counseling right around the time I started getting angry at my husband for having time off. ",
