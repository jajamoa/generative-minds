      "scenario_description": "I (f late 20’s) still live at home because who can afford to live on their own? Anyway I feel like I do my fair share but we’re currently in a heat wave and my parents decided it would be the perfect weekend to pressure wash the entire property. I was out there for probably 5 hours on Saturday and ended up with mild heat exhaustion. I’m also on SSRI’s which I learned recently can cause overheating and dehydration. After I was done on Saturday I made it clear that I wasn’t feeling well and wouldn’t be going back out on Sunday when it would be 91 degrees. I thought that was understood, until my father called me on Sunday furious that I wasn’t outside helping him. I told him I already said I can’t be out there in the heat again, and that he shouldn’t be either. He’s not usually one to hold a grudge, but he hasn’t even looked at me since Sunday. I know I should’ve been out there helping him, but honestly why did they choose to do this during a heat wave?? Am I really that big of an asshole for listening to my body and choosing not to suffer?\n\nETA: I didn’t outright refuse to do the work at all- in fact I offered to do it this coming weekend- but I don’t understand why it had to be done in 90+ degree heat. That’s my problem. \n\nETA 2: it’s 101 today and he’s out there again. Maybe the answer is that he’s insane?",

      "scenario_description": "My husband (35M) and I (35F) recently built a new house.\n\nMy FIL is a professional contractor and he was the contractor for our house build. My BIL (husband's brother) is a carpenter and he also worked on our house full time during the build. So it was definitely a family project. My FIL and BIL are both really nice people and I'm grateful for both of them.\n\nHowever, my SIL (34F, husband's sister), is a miserable and rude person. There are times she has been so rude to me that family has had to step in and tell her to stop. A lot of her rude comments have been related to the fact that my husband and I don't have any kids yet (we plan to start trying for a baby next year). SIL feels strongly that women should have kids when they are in their 20's. She has told me that I'm going to have miscarriages, my kids are going to be autistic/have down syndrome, I'm going to be an old mom etc because my husband and I decided to wait until our 30's to have kids.\n\nIn the past when we have had SIL over to our house, she only makes rude comments and never has anything nice to say. When we hosted a birthday party for my husband (in our old house), SIL walked in the door, looked around, and said \"wow, your house is actually clean or once\". SIL stopped by our new house when it was under construction and her only comment was \"I can't believe how small your new house looks\".\n\nSIL doesn't live close by (thankfully). She will be visiting my MIL and FIL this summer. It's the first time she has visited since our house build was completed.\n\nMy FIL and BIL are proud of the house and want to show it off. And I want them to be able to show it off. I'm really grateful for the work they put into the house. There are a bunch of other family members that will be visiting this summer and I'm happy to take all of them through the house.\n\nBut, given our history, I'd rather not have SIL through the house. My in-laws know SIL and I aren't on good terms. I'm sure SIL will want to see the house, but I doubt she will ask my husband or I directly if she can come by. She will most likely get MIL to ask my husband or I if they can stop by.\n\nWIBTA if I told her that she can't view our new house?",

Completely reasonable. \n\nAs for the question at hand, you are NTA but don't you think it would do more harm than good to deny her access? I honestly think you should just leave and let your husband give the tour or, if you're comfortable, your FIL and BIL since they worked on it extensively. She will most likely not criticize it to them since it was their handiwork behind it. You do not have to entertain any of her comments or feedback on the house, and you don't need to personally give her a tour and make yourself susceptible to all her asinine comments. \n\nLet someone else give the tour and then if she tries to remark on it later to you, look at her blankly and change the subject. Or if you're feeling salty, say \"I'm not sure why you think this is something to say out loud.\"",

Today I got home and knew it would be a good idea to give my son a bath, I’ve only ran a bath 2-3 times before as the bath is usually run or done by the time I’m home, now I needed to double check something with my partner, and she gave a blunt “ugh you should know this, it’s so easy”\nMe: “yeah but I just want to make sure, I don’t run a lot of his baths”\nHer:” yeah says a lot about you as a father”\nMe: “ oh fuck off,”\nIt was at that point I took my child upstairs for his bath but I really felt like that comment was unnecessary and really got to me as she already knows it’s one of my insecurities ",

She is suggesting heavily that you are a bad parent, are absent / uninvolved, or that there is an imbalance in your workloads. I'm not sure if that is fair or not but obviously you need to talk it out, and let her know how hurtful it is to hear that. Like if she has a problem to solve, she should be working with you to solve it, not passive aggressively attacking your parenting. I'm sure there is a LOT to unpack together, including the reasoning for living where you do, the impact that has on your commute, and her resentment towards you for being gone so long (seemingly) when it's out of your control and presumably the job is pretty darned important to your household. I hope you can talk it out.\n\n~~N T A but the cursing was a bad move.~~\n\nEdit to add: Others here have a really good point about whether your ineptitude in this area is approaching weaponized incompetence. I wanna give you credit for taking the initiative on this task but it does not hold water that when you're off on Sundays and Mondays, you've only give 2 baths before over 7 months. Lastly giving a bath isn't all that involved. Ask yourself \"What would I do if she wasn't here\" before you ask her to help, for a while, if for not reason than to break the habit. \n\nChanging judgment to ESH.",

      "scenario_description": "For years my brother has been trying to go into business with my husband. It hasn’t worked out for various reasons but he finally had an idea that my husband thought would be successful. The thing is before my husband goes into business with anyone he does an extensive background check on them. I’m not sure if he made my brother aware he was going to do a check or not but it’s how he found out that my brother has a daughter outside of his marriage.\n\nI had no idea this child existed and my husband warned me I shouldn’t say anything but I couldn’t just not tell my parents so I told them a few days ago. They were as shocked as me as they also had no idea she existed and they immediately confronted my brother about it. Turns out his wife is fully aware but said she would leave if he tried to include his daughter in the family which is why neither one of them told any of us about her. \n\nMy parents want to meet her and include her in our family but my sister-in-law is threatening to leave if that happens so my brother won’t give them her mother’s contact information. They want my husband to find out for them but he’s refusing to get involved so everything’s a shit show right now. I personally want to meet my niece so I’ve told my husband if he doesn’t give me the information I’ll ask the friend he uses for background checks myself which has caused multiple fights between us.\n\nMy brother hates me right now and is blaming me for his potential divorce but I don’t think it’s fair as I didn’t know my parents would immediately confront him (I did ask them not to). \n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "ETA: this was Sunday night. We stayed Saturday-Monday (today). Four hours from my parent’s house. No other rooms were available. It was NOT a party, this was a weekend fishing trip. \n\nI (28F) and my husband (28M) are on vacation visiting my parents out of state with our 1.5 year old son. It is his first big trip with a long plane ride, time difference, and unfamiliar surroundings. Adjusting has been hard, but he is doing his best. I am also early pregnant with our second child.\n\nI try hard not to let my child be an inconvenience to others or expect people to adjust their lives around him. That is especially difficult when we are not home, where he has his toys, snacks, food, and familiar routine. He thrives on structure, and so do I.\n\nThis weekend, we stayed at a friend of my parents’ for some outdoor activities. There were nine adults total and just one toddler, mine.\n\nAt 8:45 p.m., I laid my son down in a pack and play in our room. He fussed a little, so after five minutes I went back to soothe him. By 9 p.m., he was quiet. The room was dark and his sound machine was on.\n\nThis family eats late, and while setting the table, someone began clattering silverware loudly on the countertops. The room we were staying in was directly above the kitchen, which has an open balcony-style ceiling. My son woke up crying around 9:30. I went back upstairs to soothe him.\n\nWhile I was rocking him, someone started playing 80s music downstairs. At first I did not think much of it, but the volume was turned up, and a group of women including my mother started singing and laughing loudly. I texted my husband asking if he could have them turn the music down. He replied, “He is going to be fine.” I said he was not falling asleep and that I was the one in the room. He said, “It is not that loud.”\n\nI cracked the door and realized the speaker was directly below our room. I waited for the song to end so I could lay him down in a quiet moment, but they restarted the same song at full volume and continued singing. I waited for another pause, laid my son down awake, and went downstairs. I calmly said I was turning the music down because it was directly under our room and keeping him from sleeping. Some adults agreed, but others made comments about me ruining the mood. I should add the speaker had been set to maximum volume.\n\nFeeling emotional and frustrated, I gave my husband the monitor and went quietly to the basement to calm down and cry without making a scene. He came down 15 to 20 minutes later and told me I was overreacting. He said our son has slept through louder noises and that I was being unreasonable. I reminded him there is a difference between sleeping through something and trying to fall asleep with it. He dismissed me, said I was not going to change his mind, and left.\n\n5-10 minutes later I came upstairs. One of the homeowners apologized for waking my son, which I appreciated. But the others, many of whom were drunk, made exaggerated jokes about whispering so they would not wake the baby. At that point I decided not to eat and went to bed around 10:15.",

It's obvious the other adults didn't wish to curb their habits to accommodate a toddler. Probably it would have been best for you to pack up and leave the next day if at all possible. Live and learn - in the future when going on vacation make sure the sleeping arrangements are going to work for you.

      "scenario_description": "My ex gf (33F) and I (31F) first met in a whirlwind romance in May of 2023. A few months into dating she fell on hard times and I offered to let her stay with me for a few months while she got on her feet. I am an extremely independent person and love living on my own and having my own space is very important to me but I really cared for her and wanted to help at the time especially with the expectation that it would only be a few months. However, a few months has now turned into 2 and a half years and we technically broke up almost a year ago. Throughout her time here she’s had several jobs however, the positions were seasonal and/or didn’t align with her morally so she quit. When she first arrived I was of course not charging her rent as I was genuinely trying to help her get on her feet. However, after living with me rent free for almost a year I realized she probably wouldn’t have the means to move out on her own anytime soon so we began to go half on rent and expenses. However, it only lasted maybe 5 months until we officially called it quits and she couldn’t afford to pay her half and save up to move out because she’s only been able to hold down a part time position for some time now. So she is still struggling. I feel bad she is in this position still but my lease for this apartment is up in October and I planned to end it and start my solo journey as I am ready to move on with my life and start anew. However, I am conflicted with what I know I deserve and desire (which is separate lives) and doing “what’s right.” My ex has expressed that her financial instability makes her feel scared for her future, she fears she will end up homeless if I stop carrying the load for her as she doesn’t have any friends and she’s not close with her family. She feels like because we are not toxic, have healthy communication and get along for the most part that she doesn’t see why I can’t just continue to help her out until she is stable enough to do so on her own. She often gets emotional and upset about the reality of having to figure out her living situation in the next few months and reminds me that if it were her in my shoes she would continue to help her ex for as long as they needed. I can fully understand her fear but it’s been almost 2 and a half years of me supporting her and I really need to know if AITA for no longer wanting to house my now ex partner of almost a year? ",

She is HAPPY to be leeching off of you, and is using emotion and pity to keep you compliant. \n\nOh and here's the kicker...\n\n\\> reminds me that if it were her in my shoes she would continue to help her ex for as long as they needed.\n\nHard for her to do that with no income. Convenient that this hypothetical position she is adopting is that it's proper to help out 'as long as they need'. Um ok, so infinitely? \n\nCome on, OP. You knew all this when you posted. Kick her out already NTA except to yourself for tolerating this so long.",

      "scenario_description": "I’ve (22f) posted here about my roommate (24f) before. She has always had issues contributing to the household, including buying things like toilet paper, dish soap, laundry detergent, etc. She also rarely does her dishes promptly or takes out the trash or other household chores, and struggles to pay utilities on time. Sometimes I even have to hound her for the rent. I felt bad at first because clearly she wasn’t equipped to live alone but I quickly got frustrated and became short with her. We were friends at first but not so much anymore after I’ve had to put up with her for this long. \n\nOur year long lease ended and we have been living month to month since then. Eventually she got a boyfriend. He lives with his parents but that hasn’t stopped her from spending most of her time at their house. I started seeing her less and less. \n\nA couple days into May I hadn’t seen her for maybe two weeks. I texted and called her to see when she was going to pay her share of rent (due on the 5th) but she basically ghosted me. I got in contact with her mom and eventually my roommate reached out to say she’s staying with her boyfriend’s family “for now” and doesn’t think she should be expected to pay rent for somewhere she’s not staying. I kindly asked if that meant she would be moving out but she didn’t respond. \n\nI paid rent myself, which was a huge unexpected expense. After that I decided I was done. I texted her over the course of May and June asking her to move her stuff out but she didn’t respond to me. Her mom kept promising me that her daughter would take care of it but she never once got back to me.\n\nAfter July started I recruited a couple friends to help me pack up the stuff in her room and donated most of it to Goodwill and the Salvation Army. I also asked the landlord to change the locks which he did. \n\nThe other evening she finally shows up and is mad that the locks have been changed. I told her she’s not living here and doesn’t pay rent so she has no reason to enter the apartment. She got even more upset and said that she was never moving out, she was just staying with him for the time being. She told me the situation didn’t work out so she planned to come back and live here again. I told her that she was already off the lease and it’s my rental now. She started crying and said she had nowhere else to go and I felt really bad. She asked if she could at least get some of her stuff, she needed some clean clothes and a shower. I told her that because she never told me she was coming back or made plans to move her stuff out, I donated everything that was in her room unless it looked precious or expensive and stored the rest in her closet. \n\nShe completely freaked out and threatened to call the police on me. She was inconsolable. She cried about how I even donated her dead grandmother’s wedding dress, which had been in a special box somewhere in her room. I apologized profusely because I did feel really bad but it all could have been avoided if she had tried to communicate with me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I told her by July I would start getting rid of things if she didn’t make plans to do it herself. Where I live, a unit is considered abandoned once they vacate and owe rent. The cost of the items being donated will determine how long I need to store them before getting rid of them. I asked her to make arrangements for her things beginning in early May, which she ignored. I emphasized in June that I would be donating her things by July, which she also ignored. Additionally, her mother was aware the whole time and promised me her daughter would take care of it by June 30th, which she didn’t. ",

      "post_title": "AITA for refusing to share my snacks on vacation",
      "scenario_description": "I (30s F) go on vacation with my family every year to the lake for a week. The group includes my parents, my brother and his wife, and my sister. Our parents pay for the house rental. I have offered to chip in numerous times and been told no, that they like doing this for the family. My siblings and I find other ways to contribute, paying for dinner out, picking up the groceries, or paying for an activity. \n\nThe lake is kind of in the middle of nowhere with only one medium sized grocery store that’s super overpriced about 20-30 minutes away from the house we rent. Because of this I always make a run to a grocery store in my hometown before the trip to stock up on drinks/snacks. I always text the family group chat to see if anyone wants anything. Most of the time people say no thanks and that they’ll buy snacks at the store at the lake. I know my family well enough that I always buy extras since you can’t open a snack on the beach without everyone suddenly wanting some. It’s fine and I don’t mind doing it. \n\nHowever for the last couple of years even the extra snacks I bring seem to not be enough to get us through the week, despite the fact that my whole family laughs about the amount of stuff I bring. Then when we do the big grocery buy on the first day of the trip no one gets anything because “OP brought enough to feed an army!” By the end of the week we’re out of everything and I either have to go on a supply run or go snackless. I don’t tend to eat big meals and prefer to pick/snack through the day so a lack of snacks makes me hangry and not pleasant to be around. \n\nFor our trip this year I specifically kept out a bag of pretzels and kept them in my room. Watching the other snacks be consumed through the week I warned everyone that I wouldn’t be making an extra run this year and they brushed me off. By Thursday morning the snacks were gone. I took my pretzels and kind of concealed them in my bag for the afternoon and tried to be sneaky when I was eating them, but pretty quickly my brother saw and asked me to pass him the pretzels. \n\nI said no, and he laughed like I was joking and walked over to take them. I said “Sorry, but this is the last bag and it’s got to last me until we leave on Sunday.” He got annoyed at me and said I was being ridiculous. We attracted the attention of my parents who basically told me to share with my brother (like we were 8 and 10 not both in our 30s) and then made some comments about how I was being ridiculous over $3 pretzels after they paid for the whole trip. \n\nI maintain that I wasn’t being ridiculous, that I’d brought over $150 worth of snacks that had been decimated, and that my brother is a big boy with a big boy job who said he didn’t want anything when I asked and could have 100% provided his own snacks. \n\n***EDIT to address some common things in the comments***\n\nThe snacks are not my only contribution to the trip, I also paid for dinner, mini golf, and a share of the groceries. I mentioned the price of the snacks so that people would have an idea of the volume, as in I would never eat $150 worth of snacks just for myself in a week so obviously I was planning to share, not to make some kind of statement about how much $$ I contributed\n\nI am a snacker/grazer, my family for the most part is not. Eating this way works for me and it’s not something I can just turn off on vacation. I will not be accepting criticism on this at this time. I appreciate the people suggesting I do a secret stash of snacks in my room, but that won’t work unless I plan to spend most of the trip in my room. The house is about a 5 minute walk from the lake so that means every time I want to eat I’d have to walk back to the house, eat something, and then walk back to the lake, so like 15-20 minutes every hour or so. \n\nTo everyone saying “just go get more snacks” the point is… I don’t want to. And I don’t feel like I should have to when I’ve made efforts to take care of myself. From my view point, I eat in a different way from my family and I’m not asking anyone else to make allowances for that way or to subsidize it. I am sharing the additional food I brought with others and offering to buy them whatever they want initially. \n\n**Last Update**\n\nOk, so I’ve read most if not all of these comments… to those of you who have made comments on what you assume my body is like. \n\nTo those of you who just basically said “don’t go on this trip again” I appreciate where you’re coming from, but I enjoy this trip. I don’t get to spend a ton of time with my family all in one place and 95% of the trip is super fun! I think we all revert a little to our younger selves when we’re with our siblings and that’s all this was. My brother wasn’t throwing a massive fit or tattling on me, it was light sibling bickering. My parents also reverted to the early 2000s and basically went into “don’t make me turn this car around” mode. \n\nSome of you had some really creative suggestions for how to ration snacks and I think I will save them for if I ever have kids lol. For now what I think I’m going to do next year is send out my text with the snack offer, remind everyone that I don’t eat as much as them at meals, and warn them at the beginning of the trip that I’m saving a portion of the snacks for later for myself so no one thinks I’m being mean or hiding things. I also may switch to more individual items where it makes sense so that everyone can be responsible for bringing their own snacks for the day so we’re not just playing pass the bag. ",

If so, why are you complaining about covering the snacks? If they aren't contributing equally, then that is the crux of the problem here. \n\nI do think it was petty for you to run this experiment / hoard shared food. Why haven't you just talked to them and done some more planning on the matter so that you can make sure your expenses are all pretty even. Because how much food you brought or who needs to make another trip is really all hinging on what each party is contributing.",

      "scenario_description": "Posting from an alt to stay anon. My(F26) boyfriend(M24) Todd likes to make me cute videos for when I go on trips for work or vacation with friends, basically any time we're away from each other for more than a couple days. Recently I had to go on a business trip for like a week so he went all out and made a handful of vids for me. One video in particular was him interpretive dancing to Lady Gaga's Bad Romance, one of my fav songs. It is actually funnier than it sounds believe it or not. Little context, he was teasing me for how I go full stan when listening to og gaga. It really helped me get through the week and some very boring conferences I had to sit through as well. Anyways I get back home and I'm hanging out with my friends and they're asking me about the trip, and without thinking I tell them it kinda sucked to be away for so long but Todd helped me get through it. \"How?\" they ask. I felt kinda cornered so I starting explaining to them that he makes these videos for me, he made one special one for me etc etc. and it all sorta unraveled into me describing the gaga video. You can prob tell where this is heading. They insist on seeing the video. They give me shit until I just say fuck it and told them they couldn't tell him that I showed them. So I show them the video and they started making fun of him. They weren't just like laughing at it or enjoying the silliness of it but they're like meangirling the shit out of it and honestly making me upset. A week later me and Todd go to dinner with one of my best friends Grace(who saw the video) and her husband Mark who is also close with Todd, and I could tell they were both treating him differently. They seemed demeaning. Worse than that, so could Todd, and he was clearly he was pretty upset when we got home. Now I feel like I've at the same time violated my partners trust and atltered my friends perception of him, all while he has no idea of any of it. We've been talking about marriage and I feel like this could be something that could actually stand in the way of that, which would make this like the dumbest fucking thing to break up a healthy relationship over. I'n searching for ways to justify just moving forward without addressing this but it makes me feel more guilty than I already do.\n\nSo AITA for showing my friends his video?",

Them 'insisting' does not equate to them 'forcing'. Your friends also suck, so it's E S H except Todd. Hopefully he eventually gets past it but honestly you do deserve to face some consequences of this. You let your partner and the one person you should be prioritizing above all else be ridiculed over something he does to support YOU.",

He’s alright, I don’t have a problem with him, and I’m glad my mom’s happy. His family must be quite wealthy, his parents have a huge house, his dad drives a Porsche and so on. They invited us to come on this cruise this summer, where a lot of their family come together and they’re paying for the whole thing for us. Sounds cool at first but it’s 16 days, and I’ll be stuck on a ship with a bunch of people I barely or even don´t know, and I feel weird about having to hang out constantly with his whole extended family and no one at my age. And yesterday I found out that there will be these fancy dinners and events every three days. And my mom told me I have to come along with them everytime and have to wear a tuxedo because “we’re part of the family now” and all the other men will wear one. Thats when i said \"Wait, what?\" I hate formal clothes. I’ve always hated shirts and suits and this crap and my mom knows this. I told her \"thats enough, not gonna do that\" and she just got mad and said I’m being ungrateful and difficult and I would embarass us in front of them. But i was never asked if I want to come in the first place, so why should I play along with this crap? The idea of being stuck in a suit or tuxedo or whatever the difference is for 5-6 hours every few days to sit through dinner and then opera singers or some crap like this afterwards sounds like absolute torture to me. It’s my vacation. I don’t want to feel miserable and uncomfortable.\n\nWe’ve had a few fights about it now and every time it’s the same thing: \"You’re part of the family, this is what the family does, you have to be there too.\" She doesn’t care that I would be miserable during these evenings and now she already gets quite pissed when i bring that topic up again. Tomorrow she’s taking me to the mall to buy a tuxedo and I honestly just want to hide. She’s mad at me for \"making a big deal out of it\" but I feel like tomorrow is the last chance I have to avoid this torture trip?\n\nAITA for not wanting to go?\n\nEdit: I got way more comments than i thought so i cant answer everyone. I thank everyone who tried to help me or give me advice. It feels like a horrible defeat rn, but yeah i will come along. I didnt expect some much friendly and helpful comments and to these 2 \"funny\" idiots in my DMs: FU. Thx everyone else!",

The relationship is WAY too new to be expecting integration into 'the family'. I really hope you can help her see reason here. NTA.

      "scenario_description": "Long story made a tiny bit shorter I 33m and my gf 39f are in a long distance relationship and the goal was always for her to move here. This was her initial decision when I eventually had to leave the previous state. in the fall of 2024. Fast forward to today when I attempted to talk about preparing for the move. She has only given the input of \" we will move straight into a house when we get there\". That is the extent of thought she has put into the plan because \"she wants me to take charge\".\n\nI did some research and planning and based on the fact that I have a child and she has 3 children it would take roughly 3 years to plan and afford to move.\n\nMy second option i gave was for her to move sooner and just rent a place. Mind you the kids have never met, I've only met one of her kids. I figured this option would allow us to bond more naturally instead of all the shell shock of a new place and the  forced Brady Bunch scenario.\n\nShe basically thinks that my decision isn't cost effective and that I am just being doubtful about our relationship. She feels like the bonding can be done over a few family trips over the next year which to me sounds completely insane. You can't just build a bond in a few long weekends over three years.\n\n  \nSo am i the asshole?",

I think prioritizing cost effectiveness in this situation is unwise for the reasons you've pointed out, namely that the kids need to spend more time together and with each of you to feel comfortable merging in a household. That said, financial constraints are a very real thing and your GF may feel that if she's renting, she will not be able to meaningfully save towards a new house and the goal will keep getting kicked down the line. Without knowing the details of your circumstances, that also seems like a valid point. \n\nThat said, it's unclear to me what she is proposing. It sounds like you gave two ideas that she dislikes - stay where you are and save up for 3 years or she moves earlier into a nearby rental. What idea is she bringing to the table? \n\nNot going to try to offer solutions with such little info to go on, but your perspective is NOT AHish, and hers seems a tad irresponsible and flaky.",

      "scenario_description": "I'm 22F recently graduated, I have a job. My siblings, 16M, 13M, and 9F are always awake earlier than I am and regularly feed our cat in the mornings (unless I wake up first) and in the evenings (unless I'm not at work). They feed her breakfast pretty much everyday and dinner maybe 3 days out of the week.\n\nMy dad randomly blew up on me saying I am taking advantage of my siblings as I am not taking care of my own cat. Keep in mind, I have paid for everything for her, all her vet bills, all her toys, furniture, food. I clean her litter box twice a day. I thought the least they could do is feed her when I'm not there since it only takes 3 seconds to empty a can of food in her bowl. It's not like I force them either, I told them I can feed her in the mornings but since they wake up earlier they said they can do it since they're already downstairs. My siblings never expressed any issues to me. Suddenly it's a problem and I am \"irresponsible\". My dad has never had to feed her once so not sure why he's upset. Am I taking advantage of my siblings or is it a fair expectation for your family to feed your pet when you aren't around?",

It's not their cat. That statement alone makes it think you do have 'expectations' that they help you with the cat, so maybe that is what your dad is referring to when he says he feels you're taking them for granted.\n\nTry to get to the bottom of the issue. Are the siblings actually stressing about feeding the cat, or has something come up that made them feel ACTUALLY responsible for feeding it? You should probably reiterate to them and to your dad that you are willing to feed the cat when you get up if they are too busy to, or don't want to, and that the same goes for the evening. If they want to feed it because they're up and they might as well, that's great, but you don't expect it.\n\nI'll go ESH except the kids. You DO seem to have expectations of them, but your father could have addressed this without blowing up.",

      "scenario_description": "So, my (24F) mom's a hoarder and a compulsive buyer. She grew up really poor and in a dysfonctional family so her deep seated anxiety is food related and her love language is making and giving food. She worked really hard with my dad to have an economically stable life. And they gave me and my four siblings plenty, materially we never wanted for anything. They both have unadressed and unresolved traumas that make them lash out and that make them hurt us really bad sometimes(not physically). I have begged them to get therapy for their own wellbeing but they are of a generation that hates therapy and think it's a scam.\n\nWe used to be a 7 person home but now everyone left so it's just mom and dad at home. Yet she still buys too much food. She piles up food in the fridge and freezer that she says she will eat but never does. So years and years of expired food piles up and now the freezer is packed, it looks like a wall. To keep adding to it, she jams stuff inside and closes the door quickly so when you open it again, frozen stuff falls out on you. The fridge has rotten veggies, expired stuff in the back so she can't find space for unexpired things. Basically it's so full, it is hard to use and makes her daily life worse. It's also very obviously an health risk at this point. I asked her if she intended on cleaning it and she told me that she \"didn't have the time\". I recommended we clean it out together so we could be more efficient. I was sure most of it could not be safely eaten anymore but that if she were to clean alone, she would not throw anything away. She got mildly angry and refused. She told me that because it's in the freezer, it was safely kept and everything could still be eaten and that she just didn't have time to cook it. \n\nLast summer I came to house sit while they were on a long vacation. I put on some gloves, and cleaned out the fridge and freezer. As expected, I threw away 2/3 of the content, I even found some frozen shell fish with an expiry date of june 2002 and some Foie Gras from christmas of 2000. I also emptied the fridge and did a huge (much needed) deep clean. I won't go into detail but it was very very dirty. It took me 3 days of hard work and I was quite proud of the results. \n\nWhen they came back from vacation, my mom had a panic attack upon seeing it. She cryed and yelled that I hated her and wanted to destroy her. Told me I was a moralist little B, that she was starting regretting having me. My dad who agreed with me before that we should clean up, sided with her and attacked me too. A year later she still takes jabs at me for betraying her and being a moralist. AITA ?",

But it was not your place.\n\nI think her words against you were really harsh and inappropriate; there is no room in a loving mother-child relationship for that, but again I chalk that up to her MH.\n\nYTA. You are not a professional and are not going to fix her by sneakily cleaning her spaces. All you can do is set your own boundaries - you do not have to go there, should not eat anything she makes, serves, or gives you, etc.",

      "scenario_description": "My sister is getting married this year and wants me to be the maid of honor or at least one of the bridesmaids, and has pretty much already decided that it will happen. I feel terrible about this for many reasons. \n\nOne, no one in my family knows that I am transsexual, they just think I look and sound like a freak. I hate being lumped in with women like I want to be one. My sister is aware that I have always hated wearing dresses and \"girly clothes\" and doing things like wearing makeup or styling my hair, but keeps insisting we will go shopping together for a dress and high heels and she'll find someone to do my makeup and hair for me. No, I would not be allowed to wear pants/a suit and not wear makeup.\n\nTwo, I hate having any amount of attention on me at all. My family is the kind that insists on making toasts every 15 minutes or so at family dinners and I have never made a toast or speech at any of these because it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I cannot present in front of people looking at me and I cannot make speeches of any kind.\n\nThree, I am not that close with my sister. We used to be close when we were younger and both trapped in our parents' house, but nowadays we very rarely talk (maybe a text every 3 weeks or so). I understand that out of all the family we have, I am the closest family member for her, but it still doesn't feel right to be pretending that I actually know her enough to be part of her wedding when I really don't. She doesn't talk to anyone else in the family besides our mom sometimes and she doesn't have many friends.\n\nI really don't want to hurt her feelings and am fine with coming to the wedding and sitting in the corner if she allows me to just wear pants and a dress shirt, but insisting I be part of the wedding in such a way is something that I know I won't be able to do in a way she likes and I won't hate myself for. Is it very rude for me to refuse to be part of the wedding and I should suck it up, or is it OK to ask the bride to find someone else when it seems I am all she has from a very limited pool of people?",

If she really cares about having your support and making it comfortable for you - showing her acceptance and helping the whole affair feel truly celebratory - she will welcome you to wear what you want at her wedding, and maybe even if you could be in a snazzy suit you would be willing to stand up with her as a bridal attendant.\n\nIf she is using this to enforce a certain conformance to feminine expression, she is a huge AH. It's unclear if that's the case here or not. While you mention they don't know you're ftm, you say they just think you're a freak... so I guess it's unclear to me whether they realize you prefer wearing men's clothes (assuming that's a true statement), or how you'd most want to dress for this event...\n\nAs for sitting out the wedding entirely, that's a complex topic. It feels pretty nuclear to not attend your sister's wedding, but it will all come down to whether they will leave you alone for this event. If you will feel ostracized, unwelcomed, or forced to wear something that is uncomfortable to you, I do think you should bow out, as sad as that is. I've got my fingers crossed for you.",

      "scenario_description": "So I was put in an uncomfortable situation earlier this year regarding being in a coworkers wedding, and while I am happy with my decision, I can't help but feel like a dick/asshole. \n\nI have worked with this coworker, Sarah (fake) for about a year now, give or take. We get along well enough, don't get me wrong, but she's not someone I can be my actual 'self' around ya know? So while Sarah and I get along, joke, laugh, and have genuinely vibed, there are fundamental things about her or her beliefs I don't get on with but I've never really spoken about cause again, we are coworkers.\n\nShe got engaged and then a few months later, Sarah, myself, and another coworker (Meg) hung out at Sarah's new apartment for dinner. She brought out bags with our name on them and I immediately knew what it was; she was asking us to be bridesmaids. I felt *very* uncomfortable... but I said yes. I know I should've just said no but I felt like I was stuck 1) She asked both me and Meg at the exact same time so I felt pressured to say yes after Meg already did 2) I didn't drive there so I couldn't say no and then run away 3) I was in HER home with her fiance in the next room. There was also this \"pity\" factor because Sarah has mentioned multiple times that she doesn't have a lot of friends...\n\nI come to regret it immensely especially considering not only am I her coworker, but also kinda her boss. I am one of her managers and Meg is the other manager, soo to say that this was a tough situation to get out of is an understatement. I was worried I was going to cause issues at work if I backed out, Meg was gonna be upset since she wouldn't have me with her cause she also thought it was a little weird for her and I to be involved in a wedding for an employee plus someone we both have only known for a year-ish. \n\nI finally decided to back out of the wedding after Sarah's sisters were sending info in the Bridesmaid GC and I was literally not even interested. I don't know her well enough to be emotionally invested OR financially invested tbh. I sent a nice message explaining that there is just a lot going on within this next year (there is) and that I did not feel that we were close enough on a personal level for me to feel comfortable enough to be a part of her special day. She deserves to put someone there that is *actually* excited for her. She responded very kind and said she appreciated me letting her know.... but then she started getting mean and snippy at work.\n\nI am letting the attitude go cause I wanna work and go home. Should I feel worse than I do? Am I an asshole for saying no to a wedding after saying yes? I mean, is it my responsibility to spend money on an event for someone I do not consider to be my friend outside of work? ",

I think that probably made the message pretty hard to receive. Would have been better if you blamed it on being too busy and not being able to give it the attention it deserves, etc. \n\nOverall this was very ill-conceived on Sarah's part. Probably it was intentional somewhat...if she doesn't have many friends and you two came to mind, she might have thought this gentle pressure would spur a particular answer from you, etc. I don't blame you for saying yes in the moment. The best you could have done beyond that was to say you needed to think about it. \n\nContinue to ignore the attitude until it's really a problem. She is smarting right now, feeling rejected, maybe a bit embarrassed, and perhaps offended that you made it clear you weren't interested enough to participate. Just keep things positive and professional and hope it smooths out.",

      "scenario_description": "My fiancé (28M) and I (29F) live in a one bedroom apartment. We allowed my best friend (26 F) about 8 months ago to move in to help her.\n\nAbout a month ago we allowed my sister (32F) to stay as well because she started helping my best friend get her life together. They clicked it off so she took over her things from me and has slowly been progressing to get her out of my apartment.\n\nNow for the situation. My sister while staying with us recently took a puppy from a friend and the puppy has a dislocated hip. Despite not being in a position to have a puppy and everyone telling her she needs to relinquish it she's been persistent on keeping it and getting it help.\n\nSo eventually we all started to help her to get this dog the surgery she needs and convince my parents to let her keep the puppy since she mostly lives with them. A big portion of that help is coming from me. I took out a credit card of 3400 to help her out if she promised to pay it off and it is the main thing helping her receive the surgery.\n\nShe moved in about 2 years ago with my parents to fix her finances which she still is working on and she has a senior dog with her that my parents help pay for everything for.\n\nNow unfortunately just last night, we found a broken off black bloody tooth from my fiancés 9 year old cat that he's had since he was a kitten. We've known he's had teeth issues, but had zero clue it had progressed this badly and we are concerned for his health. \n\nSo last night we forced him to let us look and it looks pretty serious. Bloody gums, a lot of teeth already gone, his other ones black. His front teeth are fine and he acts normal which is why we never noticed. We had only noticed just recently that he was struggling to eat, but our home life has been obviously so hectic with my best friend and sister that we honestly forgot to check his mouth when we noticed. Cats hide pain very very well but I didn't know they hid it this well.\n\nWe are very concerned for his health so I inform my sister we might actually need to use that credit card to get him checked out because we don't have other funds. We have been in the financial trenches ourselves and have been slowly crawling out, but not to the point that we would have enough free money on any other credit card or savings to get this checked out especially if he needs surgery.\n\nAnd now I'm the asshole. Even my mother thinks I should still let her use my credit card and we should figure something else out for my fiancés cat. My family is up in arms but this cat is my fiancés cat, practically my cat. So idk. Am I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE : I appreciate everyone’s opinions, it really helps to get an outside perspective. My sister seems to be calming down about not being able to use the money, we just talked yesterday and it went well. And kitty is getting looked at right at this moment. For some context I know some people have asked why we weren’t on top of kitties teeth. We’ve had some financial disasters over these last few years and living mostly paycheck to paycheck so haven’t been able to get him to the vet. We also have other animals so if something happens to them then it takes more of our money. We are getting pet insurance through my work but I was trying to do one pet at a time since it does take about $35 out of my paycheck. We also have realized when we allow ourselves to take on other people’s problems, we neglect our own responsibilities. This has been a learning experience and we plan on changing it ASAP. My sister and friend were kicked out so that we can focus on ourselves, our finances, and our pets. Thank you everyone I appreciate it.\n\nTLDR ; Promised my sister she could use my credit card to help pay for a surgery for a puppy she shouldn't have but now I need that credit card for my fiancés cat who we have found has black teeth falling out",

Your sister is an AH for expecting others to cover her for her when she overcommits herself. She is already leaning on your parents - FOR YEARS - to 'fix her finances' and yet hasn't done so yet, meanwhile she has them paying for her elderly dog and you paying for her puppy. \n\nGood lord. You need to get rid of everyone and try to start from scratch. Establish better boundaries. Prioritize your own care and that of your dependents (not random friends and family who come to depend on you but those who are ACTUALLY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY).

      "scenario_description": "Hi, \n\nIt’s a short argument but one I can’t help but feeling justified in and a bit embarrassed that it’s even an argument.\n\nThis started when I told my fiance that I wanted to purchase an axe to chop firewood this summer for the winter. (We have an indoor wood fireplace). She believed that we didn’t need an axe to cut them into smaller pieces and we would just throw the logs directly into the fireplace.\n\nAnyway, the argument was that if I was to get an axe I would get rid of “junk” in the garage I didn’t need. I can’t believe I have that much because I’m able to fit a full size pickup and a miata inside the garage right now, so it’s not like it’s packed to the brim with things. Plus it is just an axe, not a sand blasting cabinet that I’d use once in a blue moon. \n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "This past weekend my (27F) boyfriend (29M) of 6 years and I went out to the closest grocery store to grab some ingredients to make lunch and dinner for the day. Before leaving, I asked if he had his wallet because we both share a credit account that is dedicated to our food expenses, paid via a shared account that we both contribute equally towards. He confirmed he had the shared credit card, so I declared I wasn't bringing my phone- which usually contains my ID and credit cards. It was the weekend. We were at a grocery store 10 minutes away from home. All I was planning to grab was some fruit and chips. \n\nHe decided to stop by the liquor store first, which is right next to the grocery store. I went in with him. I failed to realize that upon going to the checkout with him, they asked for both of our IDs. I stated I didn't have mine, and the cashier glanced at me and asked for my age. I told her my age, but she apologized and said she couldn't do the sale. I rightfully agreed and apologized to my boyfriend for not having my ID, saying I should have just waited in the car. He was a little upset. \n\nOn the way to the grocery store, he called me weird, suspicious, and immature for not having brought my phone. I told him it's the weekend and I wasn't expecting anyone to call/text me, and that I can live without my phone for an hour. And since I had confirmed he brought his wallet before leaving the house, there was truly no need for me to bring my phone/wallet combo. He stated that it's 2025 and everyone carries a phone- what if we got separated in the grocery store and needed to find each other? I commented that we would find each other eventually, just like I did before I owned a cell phone when I got lost as a 10 year old in a Costco warehouse. \n\nSo, AITA for not carrying my phone on my person all the time?

      "scenario_description": "We've been dating for 2 and a half years. We are both in med school. He is a year above me and his exams ended. My final exam is two weeks after his last exam and he offered to stay with me and help me study. The thing is I struggle more than him. The reason I am a year behind is I failed my first year. This two weeks he is staying with me in my apartment. We pay for things equally but we eat stuff that my mom made, I help him cook and I do the dishes and cleaning by myself. Even though I have exams and he doesn't have any. Tthe thing is I didn't ask for him to saty with me. I told him to go to his hometown several times, he wanted to stay and help. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I use meds for it which make me sleepy. So I sleep like 8-9 hours and struggle to wake up. When I have to wake up he makes noises and and scolds me passive agressively telling me \"it's okay, sleep till evening. Not like you have to study or something.\" My attention span is also fucked so I keep looking at my phone while studying. Sometimes I get bored and want a break and the minute I stop studying he starts complaining, all while playing video games. I told him to stop and he just tells me that he is doing this for me not himself. I told him he's not my mom or dad and he told me that I should study if I don't want this. I NEVER asked him to do this. I think he just doesn't believe that I can do it by myself. The thing is I am studying plus I do all the stuff at the house. I even did all his laundry. I started not doing the dishes and if I don't he never does it so I have to do them again. I don't complain about this stuff because he doesn't have to stay with me and help me. But I also don't think I deserve to be scolded. This makes me feel like crap and I think it's honestly so bizzare I don't know how to react. I got mad and told him that he can't scold me like that anymore and he just blamed me back. I don't know how to feel. This is honestly making me reconsider the whole relationship. ",

      "scenario_description": "I want to start by saying I’ve never posted on Reddit before but this situation has left me so unsure of myself. If I do something wrong let me know. Thank you for your thoughts!!\n\nI (27M) am getting married in October and my fiancée (28F) just had her bridal shower. It was relatively small (only 12 people including myself and my soon to be bride). She invited her close family, a couple friends, and my mom and sister. She did invite her own father (who is almost 80) because she wants him to be apart of these important events and he was a last minute addition on the day of the shower. She did not invite my dad because traditionally the groom’s father is not invited. She thought about inviting my stepmom but decided not to since my biological mother would be there. This would have been very awkward for everyone there. My dad and mom had a messy divorce that still plagues our lives (as you can see). My fiancée is much closer with my biological mother and wanted her to be comfortable. \n\nSome background, my dad and stepmom live 12 hours away. My fiancée has met my dad once and has NEVER met my stepmom. My stepmom is also an incredibly anxious person who hates flying and could not drive the 12 hours alone. Thank you to everyone who responds! \n\nEdit: my biological mother’s partner was also not invited to the shower. Additionally, my father is barely in my life. He will send me money occasionally but that is the extent of it. He has the means to visit me whenever but has not done that in more than 10 years. \n\nEdit 2: my dad and stepmom are upset about not being invited to the bridal shower. He texted me the day after asking why. I responded with our reasons (listed above) and he responded with “any  response other than ‘we’re sorry we should have handled it differently’ is bullshit. All the stuff you sent in your text is bullshit and made everything 10x worse.” He also called me a dick for these reasons and has brought up divorce issues that are between him and my mother. \n\nI also want to say, I WASN’T EVEN INVITED TO HIS WEDDING TO MY NOW STEPMOM. They did not invite any of his children to their wedding which was small and during the school year but still! ",

I don't think it was about traditional at all. You make it pretty clear it was to manage conflict, coupled with the fact that you don't feel as close to them. It's your event, you get to invite who you want. It's clear this was a small party held to people you are close with. But I think you invited trouble by leaving them out when they were clearly the outliers...ALL other parental figures were invited. I think this was unnecessarily hurtful and / or thoughtless of you. It makes it seem like you're choosing sides, taking this opportunity to ostracize your dad and his wife, etc. Don't use the celebrations around your wedding for that. \n\nThis might have been mitigated by how you communicated about this to them, which is missing here, and I also wonder what the actual conflict is that prompted you to post this - is someone mad at you?",

      "scenario_description": "My boyfriend (33 M) and I (25 F) have been together for eight months. \nI’m putting myself through school, and am working towards getting my third degree. Because of this, I’m super broke and penny pinch in every way I can. My boyfriend is settled in his career with disposable income, so we have different habits when it comes to spending money (our finances are completely separate).\nHis birthday was last week, but I didn’t get him a physical gift because all of the things he really wants or needs are wildly outside my budget. Instead, I woke up super early in the morning to make him a big, special breakfast (french toast, eggs, bacon, and coffee), and brought it to him in bed.\nHe’s the type to work even on his birthday, so i also made him a special packed lunch (grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, mozzarella cheese, veggies, the works, and rice on the side). While he was at work, I cleaned his whole house. I swept, dusted, mopped, picked up, and organized. Then I made his favorite dinner (penne vodka) and organized a movie night of his all time favorites. When he got home, I gave him a handwritten happy birthday card before we ate dinner and watched the movies. \nI also planned a surprise party that weekend with his friends and family (which i also cleaned up everything after) and I thought he had a great time, but he admitted to me yesterday that he was upset and felt unimportant because i didn’t het him an actual present. \nI reminded him about my financial situation. He said it wasn’t about the cost of the gift, but the gesture behind giving something, and it could have been something small. I asked him if everything else I did wasn’t enough of a gesture, and he said that wasn’t the point. Now we’re both just upset at each other. \nSo, am I the asshole for not getting my boyfriend a physical birthday present?\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people talking about love languages and communication. I agree! Those are super important. My love language is actually physical touch, not acts of service like a lot of people are guessing. I know his love language is gifts, so i thought a handmade card would be enough along with everything else. I’m just confused and upset because I tried to go above and beyond due to the fact that my budget constraints meant I couldn’t buy him a gift that wasn’t from the dollar store. I liked the comments about craft gifts! I think those are good alternatives, and I’ll talk to my boyfriend about that to see what he thinks! I hope this is just a communication issue. \nA lot of people are also asking about using the money i spent on food for a gift instead. The money i spent on food was part of my grocery budget. It’s money I would’ve spent anyway, i just factored in his favorite things (plus i used a a small bit from his fridge). My budget was, and continues to be, very tight. ",

IDK if it stems from a strange entitlement and materialistic aspect of his character or what. Maybe gift giving is his love language, and he simply doesn't value non-tangible gifts the same way. As far as I'm concerned, you DID give him a gift, several in fact. EVEN if he was disappointed I honestly think it was crass and unbecoming for him to bring it up. Who outside of a 5-year-old complains about not getting a gift?\n\nThis is obviously going to make you not want to put the effort into the thoughtful things you did, in the future, because he doesn't appreciate them. Maybe you can talk it out and find some common ground here but I would be pissed until he shows REAL appreciation or at least acknowledgment that the gifts were ALL the things you did for him that day, and they DO count even if he wants something to unwrap.

      "scenario_description": "I (27M) and my wife (27F) have a 2.5-year-old daughter. We became parents while we were still dating and chose to stay together out of love for each other and for our child.\nBecoming parents young forced both of us to mature quickly. Personally, I’ve always believed that part of maturing is also taking time for yourself. I commute over an hour to work each day and use that time to listen to audiobooks or read, which gives me some personal space. At home, I try to be an involved, present parent.\n\nMy wife stays home with our daughter full-time. I completely understand how overwhelming that is. I’ve encouraged her to carve out time for herself and explore interests outside of parenting. But any free time she has, during naps or in the evenings, she spends playing games on her phone (like Candy Crush, for example).\nI’ve gently suggested she try other things. We’ve talked about what she enjoys, and she’s tried a few hobbies like reading or painting, but didn’t stick with any of them. I’ve expressed that I think it would help her decompress and grow as an individual, but I admit I may have come across as pushy.\n\nRecently, I told her directly that I think she should find a hobby instead of spending all her downtime on her phone. I didn’t mean to criticize her, but I want her to feel more fulfilled and for us to have more to talk about beyond parenting.\n\nWe do both scroll on our phones at night, so I’m not saying she can’t relax however she wants, but I hoped she’d want something more engaging for herself during the day. Now I’m wondering if I overstepped.\nAITA for telling my wife she should find a hobby instead of just playing games on her phone during her free time?\n\nEDIT: For context for some of the comments, it’s a combination of doomscrolling on IG and TT, and games. \n\nAs I said, I’ve suggested her to take time for herself once I get home before our baby goes to bed. This way she gets a break and I play with our daughter.\n\nThe reason I brought it up is because our conversation always feel me bringing something new or thought provoking and her just reacting or answering to my things. \n\n\nUPDATE: I’ve read most of your comments and I see where I was wrong to approach this with her in this way. I am working to be better for her and understand that this her way to unwind. Thank you to all those moms in the comments explaining this to me. I would like to say thankfully we do have a good way of relaxing together playing video games, watching movies, board games, and puzzles. We also have our way of having fun as a family. ",

      "comment_text": "Mild YTA. This seems like it's coming from a selfish and / or judgmental place more than a real care of your wife's well-being. \n\nI suspect she is emotionally and mentally very drained from being a full-time carer to a toddler. Being on her phone playing a game is lighthearted, quiet, 'me time' that she desperately needs. It's uncool that because it doesn't meet your standards of a hobby, you're applying pressure to your wife to do something else. It comes across like you don't find her interesting - or like she needs to be more interesting for your sake. It also seems controlling - how would you feel if someone told you the podcast or music you listen to isn't constructive enough use of your downtime and you need to do something different?\n\nI want to also acknowledge your perspective. You want to maintain a bond and a relationship with your wife that doesn't just revolve around your parenting responsibilities. But I think you need to let your wife decompress in the ways she wants to, and actively find ways to connect with your wife otherwise. Suggest the three of you go for walks, take her to dinner, or find an activity to do together, that will give you both stimulation and provide for quality time together.",

      "scenario_description": "I (31f) asked my cousins wife ‘Elenor’(37f) to be my bridesmaid. My aunt ‘Mandy’ is her MIL. My cousin is Dan (41m). Mandy isn’t well and for the last year elenor has been complaining about her to my mom. Saying hurtful things about the state of her health,hygiene and house etc, going after all aspects of her. \nLast year Mandy got a bad diagnosis and spend time in hospital. It was a hard year for her and when Christmas came it was a chance for all the family to be together and celebrate etc. but elenor and Dan were barely around over the Christmas period. mom spoke to Dan and was honest about how we all felt about that, as well as the hurtful things Elenor was saying about her. that evening Elenor started texting my mom. She accused my mother of having mental problems and said she needed to go see a psychiatrist. She said i wouldn’t look after her in her old age the way they look after Mandy and just a whole load of stuff attacking mom. It was very civil on moms side but Elenor seemed to be on a rampage and it was like she wasn’t reading moms replies. Mom tried ringing her and Dan as she felt it wasn’t a conversation to have over text but she wouldn’t answer. Mom was really upset by the end and dad tried calling Dan too but he wouldn’t answer. Ever since then the family have gone low contact but keep the peace for the sake of Mandy. \n\nElenor has been ok with me and did come on my hen party(what we Irish call a bachelorette party). We all thought she wouldn’t show up considering what she said to my mother. I didn’t uninvite her at the time at mom’s request, we were worried if I uninvited them it would upset Mandy and she is our main priority. \n\nNow to today’s incident. Mandy’s condition has worsened and she now has different carers coming in for a few hours every day to help her. She gets on really well with her Saturday carer ‘Jane’. She looks forward to her day with her. Well last week Jane had been called into a meeting with her supervisor and was told she’s not allowed work with Mandy anymore. Turns out someone reported her for taking money off Mandy. She didn’t take any money off her though. She would sometimes pick up bread or milk, basic shopping for Mandy and Mandy only paid her what it cost. Mandy was really upset and wants her back but Jane isn’t answering her calls. Another one of her carers showed her a letter the supervisor had sent to all of Mandy’s carers. It said they’re not to do any shopping for Mandy, that her son does her shopping for her. So it was Dan and/or Elenor that had reported it. Neither of them do her shopping by the way. Mandy is really angry and upset over this, they knew how well she got on with Jane. We think that they did it on purpose to get rid of the nice carer as they don’t want carers coming in, they want her to go into a nursing home. Elenor said as much in the Christmas texts. Mandy is going to confront Dan about it.\nSo basically, am I the asshole if I uninvite her from being a bridesmaid?\n\nEdit to add: he’s admitted he did report her, he saw her in the Ring doorbell camera with a bag full of stuff and assumed she’d stolen it. It was a few Easter eggs that Mandy wasn’t going to eat and gave to her. She’s told him she’s adding my mom as joint power of attorney with him so he and Elenor won’t have sole control. Waiting to see if Elenor reacts!",

I'm hoping things in our family are repaired soon but this is for the best at this time.\" Keep it polite and relatively neutral. \n\nAll in all it's your wedding and you get to decide who is in it.",

      "scenario_description": "Not long ago, a friend invited me and a bunch of other friends over for a get-together.  I'd never been to her house before, and it was in an area that I didn't know, so I asked one of the other invitees (Alison) if she'd mind giving me a ride.  She said \"Sure\", and on the night in question, she texted me to say she was on her way to my place.  I replied \"Great!  Let me know when you're outside, and I'll come meet you.\"\n\nA word of explanation - it was a very chilly night, and I didn't want to just hang around outside waiting for her when I could stay indoors where it was warm.  So, I thought telling Alison that was reasonable.  She disagreed.  When we arrived at our friend's house, I overheard Alison indignantly telling everyone \"And then Shalamarr told me to let her know when I was outside her house, like I'm a fucking Uber driver!  I'm not a fucking Uber driver!\".  She repeated this several times, and every time she said \"I'm not a fucking Uber driver!\", her voice got more shrill.  People looked uncomfortable, and no-one said anything (including me, which I now regret).\n\nWhen it was time to leave, Alison said loudly \"(Other Friend's Name), I think **you** should drive Shalamarr home.\"  The other friend was glad to do it, fortunately, otherwise I **would** have had to call an Uber (heh).\n\nSo - WITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (17M) am staying with my older brother (22M) in Nashville while I tour some universities. While out, my brother, his girlfriend (23F) and I stopped by Kroger to quickly pick up some items he needed. On the way back to his apartment, we got off the highway and saw a homeless man standing on the corner. I asked my brother if we could give him something, bringing up the giant jar of peanut butter my brother had just bought. His girlfriend agreed with me thinking it was a good idea. My brother said “fine,” rolled down the window, and handed the jar to the man.\n\nAfter that, he got noticeably quiet. He barely responded to anything his girlfriend or I said, just giving an “uh huh” or “wow” here and there. We played a few games after getting back, and when his girlfriend left, he said he wanted to talk. He admitted he didn’t want to give the peanut butter away but felt pressured and like he couldn’t say no in front of his gf. I apologized and explained I was just trying to do something kind and pointed out that he didn’t have to say yes if he wasn’t okay with it. He said it felt like I was being performative to make a good first impression on his gf instead of trying to do something good. He also said I don't know what it's like to live alone and buy my own groceries. He brought up budgeting and living alone but I told him it's unfair to be so stingy when that man has nothing. He said it wasn't my peanut butter to give, and the decision should have come from him. I asked if his gf asked to give it away what he would've done, and I didn't get a response. \n\nI offered to drive back to Kroger and replace the peanut butter. He thanked me but decided to just get his shopping for the week done anyway and we drove to the store. He told me to grab two big jars of peanut butter “in case we see another homeless guy.” I laughed and went to put them in the cart, but he stopped me.\n\n“The homeless man didn’t have a cart. You’re gonna carry the jars so you know what it’s like.” He was being for real. As we continued shopping, he offered me snacks since he mostly has gluten free food. However, every time I accepted something, he made me carry it. Soon I was juggling two giant peanut butter jars and other snacks, and he started adding items just to make it harder, all while laughing. It was honestly humiliating, but he really has no good food at home, so I wasn't going to say no.\n\nWhen we got off the highway it was pouring rain and the homeless man from earlier wasn’t there. My brother looked over at me and said, “Now he’s lugging that giant peanut butter jar around in the rain.\"\n\nSo… AITA? I get that I gave away food that wasn’t mine. And maybe I shouldn't have chosen peanut butter to give away but another item instead, but I thought we were doing something good. IDK I feel like he was being selfish, but now I feel guilty, but also kind of confused. AITA?",

I think the argument of 'It wasn't your peanut butter to give' does have merit...it sounds like you're there as a guest so opting to give away your host's things to another person was rude, but it was ultimately not a high-cost item, you offered to replace it, and it was to help out someone else in dire need. And after that minor misstep by you, your bro was a HUGE AH.\n\nEverything from diminishing your action as 'performative', acting like he didn't have a say in the matter, to trying humiliate you in the store or just generally being super uncooperative about the hauling of the groceries, and then ultimately trying to guilt you....these are all really bad signs of his character as far as I'm concerned. He seems like someone who is actually perhaps very insecure, takes everything personally, and feels good about putting other people down. Not good. Why didn't he just let you replace the jar and call it a day?\n\nSounds like you learned something pretty unsavory about your bro.",

      "scenario_description": "So my friend (M20yrs) has been obsessed with working at the Casino for a while now. We live in a somewhat small city and the Casino here (at least in my opinion) isn’t that great compared to some other big city casinos. Apart from cash/car draws, poker machines and table games there’s not really much to it. \nAnyways he’s been absolutely obsessed with working there for years since he stepped foot in it when he turned eighteen and he’s applied for a position there almost as soon as there’s one available however he’s never gotten hired. \nEvery time we go to the casino - which is like once or twice a week he’ll bring up the fact that they’re understaffed and they should hire him and that he can be a dealer if they just hired him or something to that effect. It’s honestly gotten to the point where it’s just annoying and pisses me off every time he brings it up because if they wanted to hire you, they would have already!\n\nSo as just a bit of a joke I decided to prank call him and tell him that a position had recently become available and that the casino would like him to come in for an interview @1pm the following day 😂.  \nMind you I made this call from a pay phone @9:20pm at night and I had an American accent going as well - we live in Australia. \n\nAlmost five minutes after he got off the phone with me he called our other friend (M20yrs) to tell him he had gotten an interview at the casino and he was so excited about - I mean he was ecstatic, jumping for joy that he was finally getting his “dream job”. \n\nThe other friend was in on the prank and hinted that maybe someone was prank calling him and maybe he should check with me (F21yrs) if I was the one pranking him because nobody else knows about his obsession with working at the casino besides us🙄. \n\nLong story short, I pulled his leg for a little bit then ended up confessing that it was me who made the prank call. To my surprise he was actually quite devastated (there was no life behind the response he gave me) that he didn’t actually get an interview which made me feel bad because I only intended for it to be a harmless prank 😬. \n\nAnyways I was debating with the friend who was in on it and he keeps telling me it’s just a harmless joke and that our friend will be fine but I just want to get some other opinions. \n\nSo, AITA for pranking him?\n\nEDIT: Upon reflection, I decided to show my friend this post, as well as all of your responses and he said it's not that deep 💀\n",

      "scenario_description": "Husband (we will call Brad), and I have been together 2.5 years. Had our son in January. Things have been pretty great, but this had me feeling kind of...annoyed?\n\nBrad is diagnosed with autism and ADHD, which can make communication between us challenging at times, but we do our best.\n\nWe live in Europe, NOT US.\n\nSince Brad has AuDHD, he only works at 50%, the other half is covered by a health insurance here on a temporary basis, and every few months he has to keep applying for more. It is stressful, as we wait for him to hopefully get on a permanent coverage. Since this is so up in the air, instead of me taking a full year of mat leave, he took a majority of the days in case his temp health insurance is denied for some reason, then he can keep his work schedule at 50% and still get paid on the days he has off.\n\nWhich means I went back to work part time. I WFH as a private teacher. I choose my hours, since my students USUALLY live in different countries, I chose some in the afternoon when Brad is home with our son, and at nights, when my students would be awake and Brad is also home. I only have one student in the evening, 23:00 - 23:30 twice a week.\n\nThis is to help with some income, and we discussed this before I event went back to work. He had asked no students past midnight. So if Baby is having issues sleeping, he can take care of him and hopefully get him to sleep.\n\nWell, Brad got back on a schedule where he wants to go to bed at 23:00...every night. We try to, but with a baby, sometimes...it just does not happen. Baby sometimes will stay asleep when I put him to bed (I nurse him to sleep), and sometimes he wakes up screaming.\n\nWell, last night I told Brad I had my student at 23:00, and I would try to have Baby sleeping by then. He asked me, \"What is your plan if Baby wakes up? My bedtime is 23:00, so hopefully you have thought of something.\"\n\nI said, \"Well, hopefully he stays asleep. If not, you will just have to take care of him, or put him on his play mat and entertain him.\"\n\nHe resolutely said, \"Bedtime is 23:00, and I will go to bed.\"\n\nCome 23:00, Baby is in bed, and Brad is just getting out of the shower. I guess he woke up moments after I started with my student, as when I came out of the office, he was walking around with Baby. I took him, nursed him back to sleep and went to bed also shortly after 23:30.\n\nThis morning, he was a bit annoyed with me. When I tried to hug him good-bye as he was leaving to work, he did not hug me back. We always do this before he leaves, so I said, \"Are you upset with me still?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Yes, you crossed my boundry. My bedtime is 23:00. We disucssed this. I go to bed, and anything past that is your problem to solve if Baby wakes up.\"\n\nHe left for work...and I was just thinking...what??\n\nI feel I need to have some discussion with Brad about this, but WIBTAH if I told him he has no more boundries with his sleep and he is being ridiculous?\n\nEDIT: Update in comments/profile",

And that makes him an AH in this situation. I don't understand how people's brains work that they think they can decide something like this, that involves responsibility be picked up by someone else, and not think a certain level of *communication* and *cooperation* are required.\n\nIf he is feeling like a different schedule for your teaching would be better for your household, he needs to communicate that to you and work with you on what those new times will be. \n\nIt sounds like you each work part time. As with any parents sharing care of a child, you need to work while he is home and he works while you are home. But regardless of your respective work schedules, as a new parent, he doesn't just get to say he's the one who gets to sleep and will ignore a child up in the middle of the night. It's simply not responsible parenting, unless you both have EXPRESSLY made an arrangement in which you are responsible for overnight care, which you have not done.",

      "scenario_description": "I (22F) and my husband (27M) got into a fight the other day about finances and my mom.\n\nMy mom (44F) offered to help co-sign on a car loan for me since I have bad credit and she doesn’t. My husband had asked her what her credit score and financial status was. She had just told him that it was good and that she was stable. No more, no less. \n\nWhile I was at work the following day, he had called me on my lunch break and was voicing his concerns over having my mom co-sign on a loan. Saying that he doesn’t think it’s a good idea, that it would fall on us financially if it doesn’t work out. That he wasn’t comfortable with me going through with it because she wasn’t being open about her credit score or her financial status. To which I argued back that, that didn’t make sense to me due to the fact that she wasn’t helping me pay my car loan anyways and HE knew that. She also payed off my old car loan to help me get a new car. That the monthly payment was the same amount as my current one but with a lower APR. She was just co-signing so I would get a lower APR than what I already had and that she just genuinely wanted me to be in a safer car due to our son(2M). I also argued that no body is entitled to anybody’s credit score or financial status as well and that it honestly was none of his business. To which he took as me saying that since it wasn’t his business, I didn’t want him to be involved in the process of buying a new car, which was not the case. \n\nEssentially, we argued this for about 3 hours over the phone after I got off work (I had a work function after hours with a group of coworkers). He said some really hurtful things about my mom that I won’t say cause he definitely will find this post based on the words he used, but it was bad enough to make me upset and cry for hours.\n\nI feel like I may have left things out but please ask for more details if needed. Thank you.",

It would be YOUR loan, so of course it should fall on you financially. She's the one taking on the risk by co-signing. Is he suggesting that you two would somehow be liable for HER loans or other aspects of credit, due to her co-signing? That's not how this works. \n\nThe cynical side of me feels that he is trying to control you, or feels entitled to personal / financial information about your mom that is none of his business. It doesn't help that he took such offense to not being given personal information, he threw a tantrum about being left out of the loop on the car deal and went to a SUPER dark and disrespectful place towards you and your mom. These are flaming red flags, OP.",

      "scenario_description": "\nI (23M) got into an argument with a close friend (23M) recently and I’m not sure if I went too far.\n\nHe sent me a meme that basically said I’m “that one chopped friend who calls every girl mid” — kind of a personal roast and said ‘This you bro?’ . I felt caught off guard, since it felt like a jab at how I look and act. In response, I sent him a screenshot of his ex-girlfriend’s Instagram story, where his face was still visible in a highlight. All I said was:\n“This you bro?”\n\nIt wasn’t public, I didn’t send it to a group or make fun of him anywhere else. I just responded to him directly in the same way he clowned me. For context, he broke up with his girlfriend two months ago, and he was the one who ended it, telling me he just lost feelings. I only saw her story highlights the day before, and it came to mind as a quick clapback.\n\nImmediately after I sent it, he blocked me on everything and later sent a long message saying I betrayed him, used something he confided in me about against him, and proved that I’m immature and not a real friend. He also said other people have warned him about me in the past and that he now sees what they meant.\n\nI felt bad and apologized, said I didn’t mean to go that deep and that it was just a joke—but I also feel like he’s overreacting. He’s made jokes at my expense plenty of times, including more personal stuff, and I’ve never blown up like this.\n\nWhy I might be the asshole:\nEven though I thought it was a harmless joke, he might’ve taken it as me using something personal or vulnerable to embarrass him. Even if he ended the relationship, it could still be a sore spot I poked at without realizing. I see how it could come off like I crossed a line.\n\nAITA?\n",

I could hear restaurant noises in the background. I was stumbled and said, well, just drop it off. But after an hour texted that I didn’t find it very nice that he didn’t call me upfront as I would have loved to enjoy my evening then otherwise. His answer was, that his plans changed and I should have made it clear that so expected him that day. And that is what really hurt me, no apology, no, I am sorry, my behaviour sucked etc. i said: don’t put this on me. We had agreed 19:30 and you called 19:50 to cancel. I asked back if there are other options for his cat to stay for the long weekend. I need distance from this. He responded by saying that he would like to end the friendship and does not want contact anymore and blocked me. AITA?",

That's absurd - you had already arranged a time so of course you expected him.\n\nBut like, you cancelling last minute doesn't really feel like a proportional response. It probably really screwed him over. If you had a genuine friendship with this person, it should have been adequate for you to tell him you were pissed and didn't appreciate the lack of consideration of your time, of course. I think you knew you held the trump card of providing this service and decided to punish him.\n\nUnless this friend has a history of taking you for granted, your response was an unnecessary escalation in my eyes. \"Needing space from this\" sounds like weaponized therapy-speak.",

      "scenario_description": "At some point in future I am due to inherit a not insignificant amount of money from my mother. \n\n\nI have a full sister and half brother on my father's side. My mother has made it clear that whilst she loves my brother he is not her child and will not be in her will or allowed to inherit.\n\n\nMy sister and I have talked about this before and have decided that regardless we will gift him some of our inheritance as it is our money to do what we want with and we felt our brother might deserve some of the family money because it's not his fault he happened to have a different biological parent. We have indicated as such to him in the past also.\n\n\nRecently, however, I feel very disrespected and upset with my brother and am considering going back on these plans. He frequently has been cancelling plans and messing me around, and only really talks to me now when he needs something, which is annoying but ultimately not enough on its own for me to consider cutting him out.\n\n\nWhat has crossed the line for me however is recently I agreed to do him a favour moving some stuff, and he had said he would give me $75 to do it. I moved the stuff and he then reneged on this saying he'd rather not pay me.\n\n\nThe money isn't an issue, I would gladly have done it for free, but it is the promise and then going back on it that upsets me. It feels very disrespectful and makes me want to go back on my much more significant promise.\n\n\nI do feel like it is massively disproportionate financially to do this over $75, but equally I feel like why should I give someone who isn't entitled to my money a bunch of it for free when they don't respect me or my time or their word?\n\n\nEdit for common questions:\nHave spoken to mom about it before, she said she doesn't mind what we do with our money after she is gone, including giving some to brother.\n\n\nHe is the eldest, born of an affair, and his mother was never in the picture. He was essentially abandoned by her and left for my father who has never once said who his mother is. My mother and father broke up 2 years after he was born and raised us jointly as single parents.\n\n\nThe reason inheritance has come up a lot lately is because mom is sick.\n\n\nAlso he has stolen from me before I think that's part of it.\n\n\nI am the youngest, then my sister is the middle child, and my brother is the eldest.\n\n\nMy sister would beat and abuse me from the age of 9 into near adulthood so I don't really care about any relationship with her, just with my brother.",

      "comment_text": "In my opinion you should not conflate the issues of the inheritance and your annoyance towards your brother for these relatively small slights. It's like, you now have this money you can hold over him - even if he isn't aware of it at the moment - and you're judging whether or not he deserves the money, which you already determined he does, by every interaction you have with him. Momentary annoyance is not a good reason to withhold an inheritance. So I'll go YTA because I think you're letting the power of the money go to your head.\n\nTreat the situations separately from one another. Pay out the portion of inheritance you intended to, and separately address the feelings you're having towards your bro. If his behavior makes you not want to do him favors, or to treat him like he's kinda unreliable, or even if you find you don't want a close relationship with him because it's too one-directional, so be it. I don't see how that connects to the inheritance.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: As for the potential AH-ness of going against your mother's wishes, I see in comments that you have already told her you intend to pay some of it to your bro and she didn't care, and is seeing it as your money to do with what you see fit.",

      "scenario_description": "Some context: My best friend (also 29F) and I have known each other since we were five. We grew up inseparable. In high school, she became part of the popular crowd I was left behind. Around this time, I realized I was a lesbian and that I had a massive crush on her. It hurt watching her drift away and date guys, but I let her go and eventually found other friends. I even had a few relationships.\n\nThen for graduation she had this huge party and even invited me and my friends, things got weird. We were both drunk, dancing to  lana del rey we have always been huge Lana fans then we kissed. I tried not to read too much into it; she had a boyfriend at the time, and according to her socials, she kissed a lot of her female friends.\n\nLike a year after that she went through a mental health crisis and reached out to me. Her other friends had drifted away, and we reconnected. We became inseparable again, like nothing had changed. Eventually, she told me she was bisexual and had feelings for me. I’d loved her for years, but I tried not to pressure or project. Still, we ended up dating, moved in together, got a cat, the whole thing. I genuinely thought I was going to marry her.\n\nBut right before my 23rd birthday, she told me she didn’t think she was bisexual after all. That our relationship had started during a vulnerable time for her. We broke up, I moved out and we stopped talking.\n\nI was heartbroken.(still am tbh) I cried every night, stalked her socials, I haven’t had a serious relationship since.\n\nThen, three months ago, she messaged me. Said she missed being my friend and wanted to hang out. I was definitely still in love with her (I’m pathetic I know) but I said yes. We hung out until 5am that first night. She told me she’d been listening to Margaret by Lana Del Rey and fun fact, my name is Margaret! \n\nIt really was like no time had passed between us. She was engaged (which hurt), but I liked her fiancé. He seemed sweet and genuinely in love with her. Being back in her life helped me feel whole again. I started dating, feeling normal again for the first time in years. I stayed with her at her Airbnb the night before the wedding, we drank wine, listened to Lana, and she got a little handsy. I brushed it off as the wine talking. \n\nThen came the wedding. I wasn’t a bridesmaid, fair, since we’d only recently reconnected but I was honored to be invited. Everything was beautiful, until the first dance.\n\nShe chose Margaret by Lana Del Rey.\n\nYeah so she was dancing with her new husband, but staring at me, Lana was singing “when you know, you know.” And I just felt all of those feelings for her I’d been repressing come back and I felt so sick, it was like a bad fanfic. \n\nI left,  I cried so hard. \n\nShe texted and called, but I blocked her the next day. One of her bridesmaids messaged me saying I was cruel for walking out and ghosting her. I’m feeling extremely guilty. I didn’t want to ruin her wedding I just could not stay there.",
