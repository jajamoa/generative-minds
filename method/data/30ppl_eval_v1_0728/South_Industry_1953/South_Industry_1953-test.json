      "scenario_description": "So me (23f) and my fiancé  (22m) got engaged around a month ago. We are from 2 different states MO&KY but currently live in my home state MO. Where his family is from is about an 11 hour drive. After getting engaged we (us and our moms) all decided it would be best to have a wedding in MO. His mom volunteered to have a 2nd wedding reception in KY that way certain people (mainly family friends & distant family) could celebrate with us without having the burden of traveling. \n\nAfter location and rough date had been decided his grandma decided that since we were having a reception in KY she will not be coming to our wedding in MO. There is no reason that she can’t travel as she has taken numerous 10-15 hour trips in the last 2 years. We would completely understand if there was a financial reason, a medical reason, or something along those lines but there just isn’t. \n\nWith all of that being said I want to know if I would be the asshole if I put my foot down and refused to invite her to the reception in KY if she refuses to attend her first grandson getting married in MO after invites actually get sent out. \n\nWe just found this news out so my fiancé does not have a strong opinion either way yet as we are both still just pretty upset.\n\nETA : the point of the 2nd reception is not to provide an option. The point of the 2nd reception is to create an opportunity for people who can not travel for any reason. I appreciate the responses I have received but I would like to clarify that it is primarily for family friends and distant family who will not be invited to the wedding in MO anyway.",

      "scenario_description": " This was meant to be a one time account for something else and I've never really actually posted on reddit so sorry if this confusing.\n\n I(15F) recently got into an argument with my parents. For context they are hardcore christians and a lot their week is dedicated to church. I am not religious really and dislike going as I am often forced to do these things with them. I am also in extracurriculars from school which are band and theatre. I am very passionate about both since middle school and am pretty involved. Though often my parents (namely my dad) choose going to church over going to my performances. My mom is better about going, though after my first real theatre performance which was my school musical she argued with me about why I couldn't dance and sing like that for church.\n\n The problem is when they recently forced me to go to bible camp for 3 days. When we all got back from camp we had to stay at the church until sermon. I begged my dad to take me home over text as my body was just so sore. The day before we left I had band practice and we were somewhat active as there was a lot of walking, I also got slammed in the face the day before leaving right in the nose by accident. But unfortunately he refused and I had to stay.\n\n When sermon was going to start my mom got there with a welcome home poster and a small gift which was chocolate. I liked it a lot but it just irked me as they had never done anything like this before even for a birthday or an important achievement. I also asked why they couldn't have taken me home but my mom got annoyed and told me to stop being a crybaby as everyone else was fine and I could wait a few more hours. This also irked me a little but I just sat down and shut up.\n\n When we finally got home, a few just petty things ended up adding to my annoyance. When I went out to grab the small gift I had gotten not from my mom but one from a gift exchange my dad made a few comments like \"say thank you\" and \"what's up with you\". I don't know why but it set me off. Im not proud of it, but I burst into tears and started yelling about how they had never done anything like this ever for something genuinely important to me that I had actually worked for. Idk why I did this as I've never ever yelled at them ever before, but I just couldn't stop.\n\n Eventually my mom got super mad too and began yelling back and crying that she broke her back all morning to make that for me just for me to not like it (I really did I told her that since the beginning) and that she would never touch or talk to me again since I hated it so much as I clearly didn't love her and she couldn't believe she had given birth to me. After that I just went back to my room. I've been there since yesterday and haven't come out much but they haven't really tried to talk when I do and have acted like nothing happened. I've never felt so guilty. I really love my mom despite some differences and feel bad for making her feel as though I don't . So AITA for yelling at them?",

In my opinion, because you are still dependent of them, they can have some requirements for your participation (but not for your thoughts or faith!). They are human beings so they too have silly feelings about wanting your appreciation. Same about them being inconsiderate about how tired and beaten you really were at church: a mistake but not an asshole one. The whole spat you describe sounds like pretty normal exhaustion / misunderstanding stuff. It's not optimal or fun but things like this happen in life. No one can behave perfectly all the time and growing minds even less.  You are not an asshole, you are a teenaged human being. That does not excuse anything but it explains it to the point that you should have mercy on yourself. (And your parents should have mercy both on you and themselves, but that's not your task to worry about.)\n\nRemember that you are responsible only for your actions. You are not responsible for their feelings or their responses. Examine your own behavior and if you find things you wish you'd have done differently according to your own moral compass, apologize for those. If they felt you were not appreciative for the gift, despite you indicating you were, that's a them problem. But if you feel you overreacted, that's a you problem. You take care of you problems, for example: \"Mom and dad, I'm sorry I yelled at you and I feel really bad for doing so. In the future, I'll do my best express my needs and thoughts in a more civil manner.\" End of story. Don't care about whether they apologize for their part or not - that's not your job, it's theirs. Don't apologize for having needs and thoughts even if they don't like it. There can be more than one guilty party in any conflict.",

I wish all my friends happiness and success in their individual lives. The “only wants to be loved”-part is more difficult. I’m surrounded by happy couples. Literally. In our friend group consisting of 5 people, two have already found their soulmates, one is currently dating and the other two (me and let’s call her Kelly) are always raging singles. She, Kelly, has had some disappointing get-to-know phases. One, after weeks of texting and dating, confessed to her that he’s gay and a second guy just lied to her and ghosted her. \nShe begged us not to talk about those two guys anymore because it was a frequent topic in our friend group. She said that our “obsession” with that topic is weird and creepy and we should just leave it alone. I’m not gonna say differently, she was right. Especially back then I found the first guy preeeettyyyy cute and handsome but I always had the stance that “no he kept the secret of being gay for such a long time only for my friend to develop feelings, fuck him”. \nLast week we went on a party and there was this guy. Let’s call him Kit. Kit was kind. Funny. Charming. Everything. I liked him but he was straight which I found out a day or so later. That made me sad because he is sooo my type and I wanted to shoot my shot. And he looked interested too. Nobody ever took interest in me. But okay he is straight, and that’s cool. Maybe he was just being nice. I’m not gonna pursue him any longer. \nWell today my friends animated Kelly to text Kit. Not because they align with their personalities just because they are both single. And for some reason, I’m so sad. Like. So sad. I don’t know why. \nShe texted him and he answered. \n\nIt was literally a few hours ago. \n\nI’m so mad at me and mad at my friend. I hate myself for being sad like WHAT RIGHT DO I HAVE. It’s not like I dated him or had any relationship or sth but still it made me so sad. \n\nI thought to myself “am I only jealous or hating the fact that I could be the only single in the group?” But it’s not that. I don’t think so. \n\nWhat could it be? \n\nAITA for making it MY thing and not being happy for her???",

I talked to them and I decided I was going to try and talk to him till the cops came. \n\nWhen I went up to talk he saw me and we started talking. I calmly listened to him as he rambled on about economics. I clearly knew he had mental issues right when I talked to him as he was saying outrageous things. The cops finally came and apparently he's been called about before but the cops couldn't do anything because of his mental issues. The cops later confirmed to me that he was mentally challenged. Later he was arrested for trespassing and animal cruelty. \n\nToday he was released apparently, because I saw him at my bus stop while I was with friends. He was yelling at a bus driver, then he went up to us and started talking to us, saying we were good kids for listening to his truth. Then, out of the blue, he says \"I got something for ya\", and he proceeds to give me over $75 in cash. I immediately gave it back to him, because I knew what he was doing was not out of his heart, but mental struggle, and I knew he didn't mean to give that money. Plus I would of felt horrible because I have a job already and I didn't need that. \n\nI live with my mother. I am young. We both are poor and she lost her job last week. When I got home later on in the day, I told my mom about what happened and she got really mad at me for not taking the money because we are financially struggling currently.

      "scenario_description": "Hi all,\n\nAbout a month ago I broke up with my ex girlfriend, after being together for 8 years. Because of the housing crisis in my country we still have to live together before we can sell the house. We sleep in separate rooms, but are civil to each other, and my ex is handling this very maturely.\n\nTwo weeks ago I met a girl at a festival.  We were flirty, but nothing really happened. We talked a lot, I wanted to kiss her, but she told me that I needed to sort my life out before she wanted to kiss or do anything. Fair point, but we did stay in contact via text.\n\nEver since we’ve been talking a lot, flirty stuff but also serious stuff (since she went to a break up of her own), and even made plans to get together after I got a new apartment etc.\n\nLast week, I took a walk after dinner and ended up talking on the phone with the festival girl for a couple hours. When I got back home my ex asked what I’ve been doing and I told her I called my best (male) friend.\n\nApparently someone overheard me talking on the phone and told my ex. \n\nNow my ex is furious, telling me I’d done something disrespectful, by both lying about who I talked to, and by trying to move on so quickly after 8 years and while still living together. I explained that festival girl and I are only talking, nothing happened and I met her after the break up. I know it’s soon, and maybe not the nicest thing to do, but is it really that disrespectful? In my mind I tried my best not to hurt my ex, but I’m not sure. \n\nWhat do you think? AITAH?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "Okay so this is probably gonna sound petty to some people but I honestly don’t know anymore and need to hear perspectives from someone on the outside. And I also need to just get this off my chest because I'm still really upset over it.\n\nSo me (22F), my friend Sophia (21F), and our friend Sarah (18F) are all close. Sarah is the youngest of us and just graduated high school this past weekend. She got into our college and we all met her through a mentorship program where older students help incoming freshmen. Over time we got super close and kind of became a little trio. Sarah looks up to us. Especially Sophia. They have like a big sister/little sister thing going on.\n\nSarah invited us both to her high school graduation and was really excited about it. She even told us it would mean a lot if we came since her family situation is a bit rocky and she doesn’t have a ton of support. I moved things around to make sure I could be there. Sophia said she would go.\n\nWell, the day of the graduation rolls around, and Sophia just flat-out doesn't show up. No heads-up, no text, nothing. I assumed something came up. But later that night, she casually posted on her Instagram story that she was watching the new episode of Love Island. Literally with a glass of wine, on her couch, just chillin.\n\nI was fucking pissed. Like I don’t even care if it’s “just high school,” this meant a lot to Sarah. She even texted me after the ceremony saying “hey, is sophia okay? i didn’t see her”. And I didn’t even know what to say.\n\nSo I confronted Sophia in our group chat. I was like, “hey not to be dramatic but that was super shitty of you to ditch Sarah like that she was really looking forward to seeing you there.” Sophia hit back with “omg i didn’t even realize i missed it but honestly it’s just a high school graduation not that deep girlypop lmao.” I said, “it is that deep when you tell someone you’re coming and then flake for a reality tv show”\n\nShe got defensive and said I was being “controlling” and “making a big deal out of nothing” and that “love island is my way of decompressing sorry i didn’t wanna sit through 2 hours of names being called.” I lost it and told her she was being selfish and disrespectful and that maybe she should stop acting like she cares about Sarah if she’s gonna bail the second it’s inconvenient.\n\nNow she’s not speaking to me and called me a “drama queen” to our mutuals. Some of them are on my side and think that it was wrong of Sophia to skip, but others are saying I was a bit too harsh and should’ve just let it go. Sophia has also not apologized to Sarah at all. AITA?\n\n**EDIT:** For those who might be curious, yes it was the Casa Amor episode",

Nice way to spoil the whole thing for  her. \n\nCould be an E S H if you really went over the top to call her names etc when you \"blew up\" ofc but it does not sound like that. \n\nThat said, the thing is between Sophia and Sarah.

I didnt have a choice and had to work there since the job maket sucks. Thats not the point\n\nI managed to save up 1k for the 2.5 months I worked here. My mom started off by asking for 100 bucks a month. I had no problem with that. Then she starts demanding 100 bucks every 2 weeks. I did not agree to that at all. My family is not struggling, they both work and we're fine before I started working. So I feel like im not entitled to give them more than 100 a month. Especially since they get paid more than me. \n\nIs not about the money either. Is about her taking control of me and not letting me save up to move out because I won't be able to afford rent if she keeps asking for money. She even said that ill still have to pay her even if I move out. Whenever I bring up the idea of going out to buy stuff since I haven't been spending it. My mom says \"if the money bothers u then give it to me.\" I get its good to help out ur family but they aren't struggling, have good paying jobs while mine is bad. I only work for 2 days a week but that's because my manager doesn't wanna give me more hours. \n\nIf I give my mom the money she'll eventually charge more because she brought up the idea that I only keep 50 and I give the rest i made that week to her. So am I the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "(All names used are made up)\n\nI recently got blocked by two people at my school—one of them being the only friend I’m going to have next year for school (as everyone else graduated)—and I’m left wondering if I really did something wrong.\n\nI was in a private conversation with two people: let’s call them Tessa and Skye. We were talking about a mutual friend of ours, Eli, and I was asked why I’d been a little standoffish toward him lately.\n\nSince I was asked directly, I decided to be honest. I said that sometimes Eli doesn’t take me seriously when I talk, that his energy can be a little overwhelming, and that he’s often very openly sexual, which makes me uncomfortable. I also mentioned something very personal: I’ve always had a strong sensitivity to scent, and sometimes people’s natural pheromones give me migraines. I never said Eli “smells bad” or insulted his hygiene—I just explained a physical reaction I’ve dealt with my whole life.\n\nI made it clear that I respect Eli and think he’s a good person overall. I wasn’t trying to be mean—I was just being honest about why I sometimes pull back. I never said it to his face because I struggle with confrontation, and sometimes when I try to be direct, it comes off harsher than I mean it. It felt like a small, private conversation. I wasn’t venting behind his back maliciously—I answered a question I was asked.\n\nAlso, for context: Eli once stole something from a store when we were out—with my family—and later made negative comments about them. That really crossed a line for me. I might talk about my family sometimes, but I still love them, and he doesn’t even know them well enough to say what he said.\n\nApparently, Tessa went and told Eli everything I said. Then they both blocked me on everything—no questions asked, no space for context, no explanation. Just silence and being cut off. The only reason I even know what happened is because Skye told me that Tessa told Eli, and then Eli “went off.”\n\nTessa eventually messaged me to say something like, “If you can talk shit about Eli, what’s stopping you from doing the same to me?” And then she blocked me too. That was it.\n\nSo now I’m sitting here with the reputation of being untrustworthy, even though I thought I was just being real in a trusted conversation. I didn’t insult anyone. I wasn’t spreading rumors. I answered a question I was asked and included both the good and the bad.\n\nAITA for that? Or did I just trust the wrong person to hold space for my honesty?",

      "scenario_description": "My wife and I are on our second child and I am a stay at home father. Before we decided I would stay home we had certain conversations around expectations. I had a fulfilling career and was successful just nowhere near the level of my wife. Our biggest conversation was around sleep and schedules which has recently turned sour. I am over 40, my wife is just over a year out.\n\nOur agreement was I would take everything at night, once the kiddos started their \"cycle\" where their sleep periods were longer until 6 AM which is when she would take over. Meaning night feeds, wake up and crying, everything, and my wife got to sleep so she could work. Recently she has been getting upset that when the baby wakes up just after 6 she has to get up. The baby is now finally starting to get to where he is sleeping 4-6 hours in a stretch. I finally hit a breaking point where I am getting upset after having 3 nights of awful sleep, then the baby woke up at 640 and my wife didn't want to get up. Our first child is in preschool and my wife wanted to sleep in if that kid slept in. I was on 4 hours and 45 minutes of sleep from the night before and less than 6 total the previous two nights. What also gets me upset is that most nights now she is staying up an hour or two later than she normally would, then getting mad at me when I ask her to take the baby after that time period.\n\nMy wife has been increasingly getting angry with me when I tell her its her turn after 6 saying how good I have it. She works from home and this isn't meant to be a bashing post on her. She really is an amazing mother, sometimes between meetings she is able to come say hello to the kids which is awesome, she also exclusively pumps and I handle feeding nights outside that schedule and most of the day, but I need actual sleep. We have tons of 2 cats and a dog, a pond, and a 3000+ sq ft household. I do most all the laundry, almost all the dishes, clean up the house constantly after everyone, and although I don't do the landscaping, I do take care of everything outside as well. I manage the house bills, and keep most of the family schedule. I do a midnight feed every night so the baby can hopefully sleep as long as possible. All that being said, trying to be attentive all day and get all the chores done, there isn't a ton of time to nap, especially considering this kiddos sleep periods are 40-minutes to 90 minutes on average.\n\nI agree I am wildly lucky to even have the setup I have, and have it way better than most, but AITA for wanting my wife to hold herself accountable to our agreed schedule so I can actually get decent sleep?\n\n  \nEDIT: To note, my wife does still pump milk. She can go about 8 hours between her pumps once per day which is normally the wake cycle meaning if she doesn't immediately go to sleep after pumping she isn't going to get a full 8-hours. Sometimes she wakes up to pump then goes back to bed. The rest of the day she pumps every 2-4 hours depending on her schedule. This part should be over at 6-months though. ",

You both feel short-changed and tired and are not sleeping well enough; you both seem like good parents. Prolonged sleep deprivation sucks and in its extreme is considered a form of torture or a medical emergency except when it results from a baby.\n\nMe and my spouse had a mantra those first couple of tough years: \"resentment is tiredness\". We figured that whenever we feel resentment that *they* get to sleep / rest / do fun stuff but I do not, and this issue did not precede the baby, it as 99% sure we were tired, not actually for the real resentful.\n\nRenegenotiate. Find out what needs to be done. Divide labor. Don't get hung up on agreements you made before you knew what you were up to. Remember you love each other. IT GETS BETTER.",

      "scenario_description": "Recently, I (25F) was in a tight spot financially — my account was overdrawn and I was about to get hit with a late fee. I messaged my brother and his fiancée (my future sister-in-law) asking if they could Venmo me a small amount just to float me until payday. I said I’d pay them back that Friday.\n\nI normally don’t ask anyone for help unless I really need it. I included her in the message because my brother rarely responds. At first I didn’t get an answer from either of them, so I followed up with something like, “If it’s a no, that’s okay — just let me know.” She eventually said no (which I completely respected), but then sent a long message afterward.\n\nIn it, she told me it’s hard for her to be asked for money, especially when I get tattoos, go to music festivals, or post things that make it seem like I’m “living in luxury.” She explained that she had over $100K in student loans, worked two jobs, and cut out every extra expense to pay them off. She said she didn’t get to do things like nails, concerts, or travel, and that when she sees me doing those things, it feels like I don’t value how hard she’s worked. She also said she thinks it’s great that my parents were able to help me financially — but that her parents couldn’t, and that makes it even harder for her to see the differences between us. \n\nShe ended by saying that if I was ever in a true emergency like needing food or rent — after cutting out all extra spending — she would absolutely help. But she would prefer not to be included in money requests unless it’s that level of serious.\n\nHere’s the thing: I haven’t responded yet. I do respect her and I understand her background and her boundaries. But I’m still hurt, and I don’t know if I’m wrong for feeling that way.\n\nI’m not living in luxury. I’m in debt too. I have thousands in medical bills. I owe taxes from freelance work I couldn’t afford to pay. I make monthly payments to the IRS. I don’t have the option to pick up overtime, and my paycheck barely covers my basic expenses. The few things I do post online — a trip, a tattoo, my nails — either happened months ago, were gifts, or were one-time things I budgeted for. Social media is curated. Like most people, I share highlights, not the daily stress of scraping by.\n\nJust because I try to make things look okay doesn’t mean I’m not struggling or that I don’t work hard. And it definitely doesn’t mean I don’t value what others go through — including her. I’ve never once judged her or tried to compare lives.\n\nBut in that moment, when I was already feeling embarrassed and vulnerable for asking, it felt like she used the opportunity to unload frustrations she’s been holding onto about my life. It came off like a lecture, and like I was being judged for how I live and how I cope. It felt like i was being resented for how i was raised. \n\nSo… AITA for not answering?…… Am I wrong for thinking her assumptions about me were unfair? do i respond? \n",

She made a group chat with me and her friend. we all got along great. Fast forward to today, she and her friend were playing Roblox. i her friend, if I could play with them. her friend asked for my Roblox username. i gave it and then asked for hers. i then proceeded to go to her follow list and got the original girl's username. and sent her a friend request. She asked how I got her username. I told her, and she accused me of stalking. im pretty sure i made the wrong move of denying that i did over and over. After a while after she said she was going to sleep said I'm sorry. Am I an asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "TLDR: SIL didn't want to go to my husband's birthday party and is now expecting us to plan another since she can't afford to host another one herself. WIBTA for saying no?\n\nHis birthday was last month. His family is obsessed with celebrating birthdays, even though we are all 30yo+. That's fine, but you can understand how hard it is to get 10+ family and friends together for every single birthday when everyone is working different schedules.\n\nWhen his birthday was approaching, I had heard nothing about plans but knew his sister had bought him tons of gifts, so I stepped up and sent out an invite for something my husband wanted to do - a barbecue at the beach. Free, relaxing, and a chance to enjoy the beautiful weather. \n\nHis sister responded, disappointed, that she and her family would actually prefer dinner at a restaurant because they want to be indoors/in the AC. My first thoughts were that, if you are invited to an event that you can't or don't want to attend for some reason, asking the host to cancel or change those plans entirely is quite rude. \n\nIn an effort to stand our ground, we let them know we were going ahead with the barbecue, but if they wanted to plan a separate birthday dinner, they were welcome to. \n\nSo, SIL chooses this upcoming weekend for a family-feast-style dinner at a nearby restaurant. Neat! We adjust our schedules to accomodate. As the day approaches, husband reaches out to sister to ask what the plans are. Turns out, she has nothing planned - hasn't invited anyone else, hasn't made reservations, and hasn't looked at the menu to calculate the cost breakdown. \n\nThe family meals at the restaurant come to $120 each, feeding 4 people. That would feed SIL's family alone. With the rest of us added, we would need at least 2 meals to feed everyone. When we talked all this over with SIL, she realized that the cost splitting would still be over $30pp. That's when she admitted that they just paid their bills and can't afford it.\n\nNo worries. Sorry it didn't work out!\n\nNope. She's now asking *us* to plan something else, something that's less expensive, because she's out of ideas. \"Can we have the party at your place?\" Why, so I get to buy all the food and stress about prepping the apartment to host on short notice? \"Wish we could, but our house is a mess while we're reorganizing\". She is currently waiting for us to think of something else.\n\nConsidering: 1) we already hosted a birthday party that she didn't want to go to, 2) her poor planning would have ended with us footing a $200+ bill, and 3) the series of inconsiderate requests, my husband and I are ready to cancel. Knowing this would break her heart, WIBTA?",
