      "scenario_description": "My daughter is 13 and she goes to a small school. Her grade only has 18 students (10 boys and 8 girls). My daughter also has other friends from the sports she does. We plan to have her go to a much larger high school in the future. Her 13th birthday party was last weekend and I asked who she wanted to invite, she wanted to invite 7 of the girls from her class and 5 from her soccer team. The one girl she doesn't want to invite is name Kelly.\n\nMy daughter doesn't like Kelly, she is the class clown in her grade and my daughter hides her annoying and attention seeking. I asked her why she didn't want her there and her response was \"she ruins school for me all the time, I don't want her to ruin my birthday.\" I agreed with her list and sent the invites out.\n\nMy ex-wife is invited to all her major milestone instead of us doing separate events. I learned an hour beofre the party my ex-wife sent an invte to Kelly since her mom found out about the party. My daughter was not happy to see her (it was a suprise for her), I told her to enjoy the party.\n\nIt was going well until the cake came out, my daughter wanted a glitter cake (when you blow out the candles glitter goes everywhere). While everyone was around the cake, Kelly took her fingers and swiped icing off the top layer of the cake. It ruined the cake and my daughter lost it. She yelled at Kelly, basically saying, \" what is wrong with you, this is why I didn't want you her and that you ruin everything.\" She ran to her room after and Kelly was crying.\n\nKelly's parent is wanting an apolgy, my ex-wife wants her to apoligze as well. I am refusing to make her do that or punish her at all. I pointed out that my ex never should have invited her and to the mom that her child ruined the cake, and that at 12 years old should know better. They are calling me an ass and my daughter is just upset.,",

I bought a cup and was about to let both Andy and Matt start feeding the horses when Carl said Matt might accidentally get bitten. The farm does have a sign saying they aren’t responsible if the horses bite or spit on you. So it probably has happened or the people working there think it could happen. Carl said it would be better not to let Matt get too close to them, since he isn’t a particularly careful boy. I figured he was right.\n\nSo only Andy got to feed the horses. When Matt told Jeff about this, he got upset and said we over worried, and that Matt would have had a better day if we just let him take part in the activity.",

      "scenario_description": "Hey y'all, I thought I would come here and ask if I was the asshole and also because I feel like I need to make sure I'm just not fucking up\n\nI (17) live with my dad (62), today he wanted help taking down some canopy's we had up for the 4th of July. I decided since he has a lot of back problems to do it myself, since it shouldn't be the hardest thing to do myself. Canopy one was fine, I just had to pull the legs in, simple enough. Canopy 2 however was different. This one I'm pretty sure is different, I can attach an image if anyone wants one of it. But pulling the legs in was no luck in me closing it, so I decided to Google it to see how to close it. Google wasn't as much help as it could've been but it led me to realize that the canopy was removable off of this one, so I thought I had to remove it to take it down. So I removed the canopy and began to figure out how to take it down.\n\nThat's when my dad comes out of the house, and tells me \"It's not done that way, you're breaking it, put it back on it.\" I try to put the canopy back on it, had it the wrong was initially, and then he just told me to go inside the house and started yelling at me all the problems he had with me. This is a constant issue but it's not relevant to the post for me to describe all the stuff he said, but the short of it was just saying how I didn't listen, destroyed everything I touched, and how technology made me this was and I can't fend for myself.\n\nHere's some other stuff for context that might be helpful to know. I didn't help put this canopy up, his girlfriend did. He planned on moving them to our yard, something he didn't voice to me, and if he did I would've done it the way he wanted me to, and it would've been much simpler, so I didn't actively choose to do in that way, he just didn't tell me. He has a lot of back pain.\n\nSo... I suppose I should finally ask, am I the asshole for trying to help my dad with the canopy's?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi, I don't know if this post is going to be taken down because I feel as though it's a pretty close to a relationship question, but I'm asking here because I've seen AITA used the most for advice on reddit. This account is not my main. Also, I already think I'm the asshole, I'm just looking for confirmation.\n\nAs per the title, I'd like to know if I'm in the wrong for preferring my boyfriend to my friends. My boyfriend and I have officially been together for 5 (almost 6) months, and we are very happy and are both very codependent people. The issue is, I am almost always with my boyfriend, which I don't have a problem with as he's very comfortable to be around and I enjoy spending time with him; however, multiple of my friends have made comments on it. My best friend in particular, who is the one who got us both together, has made the most. Before he and I were dating, my best friend and I were pretty inseparable, and we were usually always together and hanging out. She doesn't really hang out with many other people, and she doesn't have a partner herself. Now I'm mostly with my boyfriend. I have actually admitted to her that I prefer spending time with him over anyone else, which she didn't have much of a response to. She's always asking hypothetical questions about whether I would choose him over her or saying that I love him more and don't really care about her. In my mind, I love them both in different ways. They are both incredibly important people in my life, and I appreciate them both. Even when my boyfriend and I are talking about future plans, I include her in them (like we'll all get a house together when we're older). I do agree that I could be spending more time with them, but she never really asks anymore. You may be wondering, \"Well, why don't you ask?\", and I totally get that, I just literally never ask people to hang out. I've always struggled with being the one to text first or ask to spend time together, but if someone else does, I will absolutely be responsive. I never ask my boyfriend if he wants to spend time together; he asks me, and if I'm free, I'll accept. Honestly, if my best friend asked to hang out over the weekend, I would cancel on my boyfriend for her, but she never asks. I guess she assumes that I wouldn't want to or that she's taking me away from him, but I have said to her that I spend plenty of time with him and that he could get over it if I needed to spend a day or two away from him. I probably do seem like an asshole, and maybe I am, I just want to know everyone else's thoughts.\n\nFor context, we are all teenagers (if that changes anything). So, reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I already knew how brutal Reddit could be going into this, and I definitely received some of that energy today, but I think it's warranted. Looking at everyone's conversations and advice made me understand some things that I already knew but was too afraid of actually being the bad guy to realise. I love my boyfriend and my friends, and I'll make more of an effort to even out time with them. I had a sleepover with all of my female friends just last night and will be trying to work with everyone's varying schedules. I'm seriously not used to having such a busy social life and this year has been a major shock to my system. Either I had a partner or 1-2 friends, never both, so I think it's been a bit of a learning curve for me. Regardless, thank you all for the feedback and advice and I will try to be less of an asshole.",

If you just wait until your best friend gets in contact, you might find that's never; she'll find better friends and move on. Then you might break up with your bf, and have neither.\n\n\nYTA but only very gently. You are all young, you're still practicing this stuff. Now, get off Reddit and msg your friend(s) asking if they want to hang out at (some nice location and time).",

      "scenario_description": "Yesterday at around 4:45pm I (18F) came home from a pretty long day of work followed with a very drawn out psychiatrist appointment. I was understandably pretty burnt out since my boss had been giving me crap all day, and my psychiatrist would not stop asking me questions (which is her job , it just got to be a very long, emotionally exhausting discussion). \nI came home with my Prozac refill and I set it on the counter to use the restroom as I hadn't yet that day. I spent a while in the restroom brushing out my hair and getting ready for bed. I was pretty spent, and my last task of the night before I got to go to bed was filling up my pill organizer. (For context, my father has been bugging me about moving out for quite some time even though I've only just graduated.)\n\n When I went out into the living area to get my meds, I saw my father very deeply analyzing the label on my pill bottle. Upon asking him what he was doing, he proceeded to tell me that apparently the dose was, 'too high for someone who could get up for work everyday without problem' (which isnt true). I told him that he didn't know if I got up without problem or not because he was usually gone by the time I had to get out of bed for work. The conversation escalated pretty quickly into yelling from there. I told him that if he ever listened to me, he would understand that even on antidepressants, I still struggle to do basic tasks and get out of bed at times, and he told me that, 'that kind of behaviour is just from me not being productive enough' (which is an incredibly low blow since I've had depression since middleschool and have always struggled with productivity). It morphed into us throwing insults back and forth, and my mother stepped in, and told me I was ridiculous for yelling without reason. At that point , I had already given up and gone to my room.\n\n I assumed waking up this morning that the interaction would be forgotten about , but when I went out to make myself breakfast,  my father was sitting on the couch just... starting at me. I asked him why he wasn't at work, and he told me it was because we 'needed to talk'. He then proceeded to tell me that I, apparently, was too emotional being both mentally ill and a teenager to be living in my home any longer. He told me that I either had to start paying rent to live at home, or I had to move out by the end of the year. I am completely torn on my decision, and I'm beginning to genuinely question if I was being too sensitive by yelling at him yesterday. So aita? \n\nI feel like yelling might have taken it a step too far, since it could've just been a poorly articulated joke on his end. I come from a family of pretty sensitive people, myself included, so I definitely could've been overstepping it. I'm genuinely questioning whether or not I hurt his feelings since he is usually a pretty easygoing man, especially as my father, but I also feel as if asking me to move out over this is a bit drastic?\n\nEdit - For an extra bit of context,  i graduated a month ago. Since the day I woke up after graduation, he has been talking to me about my plans for moving out places, I might want to live and saving up for a place. I didn't quite mind this, although I found it kind of frustrating since I just now found a job after struggling to keep one because of my severe depression. We agreed that I should be moved out by the end of next year, and if I push that deadline, I would start paying rent. I was completely fine with this arrangement because I am eighteen now, and it's his right to ask me for requirements on his home. However, cutting my time short by an entire year is going to not only screw me over financially if I do get kicked out, but it's also the fact that if I do start paying rent, I will never be able to afford moving out in the first place. I NEED that year to figure things out. I can't juggle freelance voice acting, a crappy service job, and my mental health.",

Don’t get me wrong, she isnt rude and we get along amazingly but have 5 people living in a house not big enough for it and with only bathroom is so crowded. My parents are split so they can always stay over at my mom’s but never do. I don’t speak to my mom much because her work schedule and mine don’t really work together but we are not on bad terms or anything. Now the obvious thing people would say is, “Why not stay over there?”. This would be an amazing idea but sadly I cannot sleep much over there just because I live in the basement and when she wakes up to get ready for work it keeps me from her footsteps. So, to counter that I stay with my grandparents a lot, and they enjoy having me there. I am there a lot in the summer regardless, but my dad doesn’t like it and gets annoyed when I ask. I just want my space and not to feel so crowded by everything. (Please ignore the title I just now realized it..)",

      "scenario_description": "My wife (32f) and I (35m) were recently on vacation over the 4th of July, which also happens to be my wife's birthday. We had all the normal traditions for our family, including cake. We all had a piece day-of but almost nobody ate cake the entire rest of the trip. When the time came to return home, in-laws (MIL made the cake) offered to send the whole thing with us because they \"didn't need all that and we will probably just throw it away.\" My wife hates food waste, so she brought it. The journey home was two days by car. It has since been two additional days since we got back. Each night after dinner, I've had a reasonably sized piece of the cake for desert. I used to be a bigger guy and while I have much better habbits now, I still have a soft spot for baked goods...the cake was \"budgeted for\" though and I had been looking forward to eating a little. Well today my wife saw that there was only one slice left and was irate... Saying I was completely selfish and had eaten almost all of HER cake. I told her the cake had been available to all for nearly a week (counting days it sat on the counter before we took it home with us) and that nobody had bothered to touch it but me. I did apologize after she finished explaining to me that it upset her but I dont understand why it's such a big deal to begin with. The cake was right there...she never even had a bite.\n\nFor additional context, in the past she has requested that certain foods be saved for her as leftovers etc. Ive obliged, only for that food to sit until it had become moldy and she claims she \"forgot it was in there, oops.\" For someone who hates food waste, allegedly, I find this behavior doubly puzzling... Was I wrong here?\n\nEdit to answer some recurring questions:\n\nIt isn't, nor has ever been a \"my cake\" or \"your cake\" situation in our family. Its just THE cake, to be shared. There has never been an expectation beyond making sure the birthday person gets the first slice. After that, its just a regular old cake.\n\nThe courtesy some are relaying is to simply ask if she wanted a slice while im serving myself. In our home, this has never really been a consistent thing. It does happen, but its not an expectation and doesnt happen every time. Desserts are just understood to be periodically available and if you want some, its there. Different rules for small children notwithstanding...\n\nFinally...we ate on the drive. Idk why people exclude those two days from when the cake was available. Obviously we didn't drive 48 hours straight without sustenance... and the first night we obviously had to park and rest somewhere. And besides that we were home for dinner on the second day as well.\n\nUpdate: I have decided to simply bake her the exact same cake, in a smaller tin just for her. It will be her cake and nobody else will touch it. If it gets wasted, so be it. I hate the waste but its not worth the division.\n\nUpdate 2: the remade cake was much appreciated. She has yet to take a single bite. Not going to track progress. The cake was made as an apology, not to test the theory. This is the final update. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (14F) was left alone at home yesterday while my mom took my brother to get his ID. I started experiencing severe stomach pain (it's also my time of the month) and wasn't feeling well. When my grandma invited me to a rugby game, I told her I didn't feel up to it due to the pain. She was understanding.\n\nHowever, when my mom got home and I explained my situation, she accused me of faking it and called me lazy and useless. She compared me unfavorably to my older brothers, saying they're good at everything. When I tried to calmly explain how I felt, she yelled at me. I lost my temper, called her a bitch, and ran off crying.\n\nTo make matters worse, my dad and brothers seem to think I'm being unreasonable and that I should just \"toughen up\" and deal with it. Since then, I've been ignoring my mom and acting like she doesn't exist. I'm also considering staying with my grandparents for a while to cool off. So AITA for calling my mom a bitch and ignoring her?",

Being a teen is not an excuse for bad behavior (only a reason for being lenient about the consequences).\n\nThat said, period pain is real, and it does not seem like your folks realize this. It is also not \"just normal\" to be in terrible pain once a month these days; treatments do exist and your parents should assist you in geting them. And calling your child useless is *absolutely* not ok.\n\n\\#1:  \n\"Mom, I am sorry I called you a bitch. That was out of line, no matter what.\"\n\n\\#2:  \n\"Mom, can I ask your advice with my period pains? They are really getting too much for me.\"\n\nPreferably not in the same conversation.\n\nIf they dismiss you or do not apologize for their part, go to your grandparents. \n\nI guess ESH but I feel kinda bad for saying that.",

I Deliver Newsletters as Mini Job and she is a waitress in a Restaurant so our work time is really different. I have a Problem with her since she is avoiding every Single Chore in the houshold. For Information, both of our parents have a sight Walking disability. My Father (51) has a Bad hip from Football and working and is a shift worker in a factory and my mother (49) has a Bad leg and is unable to work because of a grave car accident a few years back. So we are supposed to help them out in the house, wich for me is no problem even if I dont like it sometimes. But my sister is my problem. She does Not help at all. She does t Do dishes, laundry or takes the trash out and when I ask her to help with something she snarks at me and tells me to do it myself. She works 2-3 Times a week besides school but has time on the other days. But then she purposly goes out, goes drinking every weekend at a Friends and sleeps there and often time does t come back Till sunday evenings. The chores still need to be done so its always me who has to do the kitchen or the vacuuming or sweeping. It's been like that for Months and I tried talking to her multiple Times but it only got worse Now that we have summer Break. She sleeps Till 1-2 pm, eats something and holes herself Up in her room and is on her phone all day. We also have a dog wich is our responsibility but she does t full Up his water or food or grooms him (He's a long hair and we have summer) and only walks him in the evening. When I try to talk to her about helping more with chores she gets really defensive saying that she does enough already and when I then Start listing Things that I did that week and ask her when the time was that she took the trash out or did the kitchen she yells at me to stop playing the victim and Not to annoy her. I'm at the end. I tried talking with her again today and she did the same Thing and I snapped. I told her that if she is t doing anything anyways that she should Just move out since it's Not like it would affect as and she got all Mad and is not talking to me anymore. I dont feel Bad about What I said. I'm tired of always being her punching bag when she has a Bad mood (wich is often) and to get treated really Bad by her. Even our parents noticed and told her to talk normally to me or that she could Do more since I'm doing more than her already,but she is not Listen Ing to the. I'm at the end, What should I Do? Sorry for the long rant! ",

      "scenario_description": "I'm a biological female, 14 years old. My father, 37 years old, is divorcing my step mom of 10 years. \n\nAbout 2 months ago my father told me on my BIRTHDAY WEEKEND that he and my stop mom were getting a divorce. I was obviously upset(and still am)but it feels he's going WAY too fast with his new 'girlfriend.' \n\nI had recently gotten a job for the summer, and haven't had much time to see my father. So fourth of July week, I took it off to see HIM and my FAMILY. But I didn't expect to meet his new 'girlfriend' for the first time. Mind you, they've been dating for 2 months and my father has only JUST filed for divorce 3 MONTHS AGO.\n\nWhen he picked me up, it felt good to talk to my dad. I have had known about the woman he has been talking to for only a few weeks and I've been hurting for a while about the divorce, and I think that he just didn't care. I saw a message come through reading: \"___Baby girl.\" And I got really quiet, how could I not?\n\nOnce we got back to our new apartment that I haven't even SLEPT in yet, I brought her(the new girlfriend)up. I told him how I felt and that I wasn't ready to meet her yet, but he said, \"___ I'm adding value to our lives, ___.\" And I didn't know how to feel about it. We talked about it for a while, and I just gave up asking not to meet her. \n\nAnyways, about the fourth of July... my father had dropped me off at my grandparents house on a Wednesday. I wasn't very happy about it but I went along with it. So on fourth of July, that Friday, he had promised to see me and my cousin for a little, which I was excited about. But I had texted him when he was gonna see us, and he called me.\n\nHE WAS AT HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND'S FAMILY REUNION.\n\nHe PROMISED me and told my AUNT he'd come see HER too. HE told HER that.\n\nMy father and I were on the phone for about an hour, and I was PISSED. AITA for being so upset with him? Is it reasonable for me to be mad at him? Because I can't help but feel that he's replaced ME and OUR family with someone else's family. ",

My character uses a chain like a whip/lasso (hes cowboy themed and has 18 strength). \n\nThe dm gave me a ability on my chain where I can hit as many times in a row as I continue to roll above the opponents ac, myself and his brother asked him when I got it if he was sure he wanted to give me that because it seemed really strong and the dm said it should be fine. \n\n\nWell come boss time I used reckless attack (I roll with advantage) and because im rolling advantage on each hit i end up doing like 35 damage on the first turn then killing the boss turn 2 with 67 damage because I kept rolling above ac with advantage. \n\nThe dm the rest of the session was incredibly upset with me and had to make up a bunch of filler because he had spent the 4 weeks between sessions making the boss battle aiming to make it long and challenging but I ruined that. Even some of the players seemed really upset at me, AITA for taking advantage of what he gave me knowing how busted it was because of my experience at the game?\n\nNote: he did nerf the ability post session by limiting the attacks to a d5 to determine the amount of attacks but buffed the damage slightly.

My guardian Jennifer and my auntie Sarah asked me what days I can get off work. I told them that my dates were August 7–10, while everyone else’s dates were August 7–11.\n\nOne of my other family members, Nina, booked the flights for everyone. I didn’t know she was the one booking — I thought Jennifer or Sarah were booking the flights were taking care of it or would tell whoever was booking since they were the ones who asked me about my PTO. This has never been an issue before — usually if I tell them my dates for family trips, they handle it.\n\nWhen the tickets were sent out, I realized my flight was for 7–11 instead of 7–10. I told the Nina and she gave me her card to rebook the flight and asked me not to tell my other guardian Ashley about the $175, because she would be upset/angry about it (Ashley pays for the trips usually).\n\nToday, Nina told Jennifer about it. Jennifer then told me it was unfair for Nina to cover the cost and that I should’ve made sure to communicate my dates directly to Nina to avoid a mishap. But I honestly didn’t know who was booking and assumed Jennifer or Sarah were handling the bookings since they asked me the dates and it hasn't been an issue in the past.\n\nNow Jennifer wants me to pay the $175 myself, but I don’t have that money right now. If I’d known who was actually booking, I definitely would’ve double-checked. I know now in the future if my plans are different to double check, it's just never been a problem before so I had no reason to think it would be different this time. Also side note all of m.y family members mentioend are 50s\n\nSo, AITA for not double-checking? And what should I do?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi, my name is Joseph, I'm 32 years old, and since my dad died 5 months ago I'm the caretaker of my mom, she has been dianosed with senile dementia and at the very moment I got the responsability of watching her I knew it wouldn't be easy. \n\nI'm the younger of three sibilings, my Sister Gabriela and my brother Leo have their lives made, with their own families and good Jobs. I'm the only one without partner or kids, I was out of the country for eight years until I returned a few months ago to sort out some paperwork I couldn't handle from the embassy in the country where I was residing, one week after my return my father died. It was not easy, my mom's mental condition, that was already unstable got worse. She can not remember in which day we are, most of the time she think we are still in march, the month my father died. \n\nLife is generally very erratic and chaotic with her. If I'm not careful, she'll set the kitchen on fire while trying to cook something, leave the pipes open, or find cutlery and dishes hidden in completely unexpected places, like inside the washing machine. It's been five months where my patience has been tested to levels I didn't even know I could handle. And the problem is, I didn't sign up for this. My siblings simply told me that dad wanted to give me the house since he already gave a house for each one of my siblings, that I shouldn't leave, and that I should stay with Mom, since she probably won't have much left anyway. They support me with money, food, and medication; basically, I'm not spending anything to take care of my mom but they dont lisent to me whenever I say we should hire a full time nurse to do this job... \n\nI think is not fair, this isn't the life I wanted for myself. I want to go out, live my life, and work and earn my money like I've been doing for years... But I'm afraid the stigma that will fall on me if I decide to leave will haunt me for life. There's also the issue of the house. I feel like my siblings are using the takecaring for my mom as an unwritten clause to get out of having to take responsibility for anything beyond the expenses. Honestly, I'm not even interested in the house; I'm tired... I love my mom very much, and I could perfectly commit to visiting some days at weak and sharing the caring for her a couple of days a week, but I'm not prepared to care for her 24/7... It's exhausting; it's like dealing with the manifestation of irrational chaos.\n\n\n",

Someone coming when you ask for something important is not enough, you need to have regular scheduled breaks without something else going on. It can be hired help or it can be another relative but it needs to be there. The job is too hard for one person 24/7. Without breaks, you run a high risk you'll get tired and resentful, the person with dementia will sense that no matter how much you try to hide it, and the situation become unsafe. \n\n\nI'd suggest you sit down with your siblings and explain that both your AND your mother's sake, the current situation cannot continue.",

      "scenario_description": "I (26F) am renting an apartment in the city center of my city. My boyfriend is currently spending months living at mine's. My boyfriend can sometimes be forgetful, and I usually try to be patient with that. However, about one or two weeks ago, my neighbors rang my bell to tell me I left my set of keys (the one I lent to my boyfriend) outside my door. As it was the first time it had happened,whe apologized and I didn't make a big deal out of it. As I was leaving yesterday, my key couldn't fit the door and I got stuck for a few minutes inside. When I finally managed to open the door, I realized it was because he had left his keys outside again. I was anxious when trying to open the door as I already got stuck inside, with my key broken in the lock two years ago, we changed the lock but I was scared this might have happened again and I really needed to go to work yesterday. When I saw his set of keys, I was angry at my boyfriend, and late for work, so I went to him and threw the keys on the bed, where he was sleeping (next to him, not on him) and told him \"you left the keys out again, I thought I was stuck. \" and went to work. When I came home, he was angry at me for doing that, and told me that he gets that he forgot it again but that's not the way to do things. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, and thought it was legitimate for me to act that way out of anger, I didn't think it was too bad as it was after 9 am, not like I woke him up in the middle of the night, and even if I live in a relatively safe city, I think leaving your keys outside is a big deal and should have been his responsibility, especially as it affects me if something happens because he doesn't have his name on the rental contract. I agree that I could havedreacted better, but genuinely didn't think it was that bad to throw him the keys. So, AITA? ",

      "scenario_description": "I (30f) have my family (senior mother and adult sisters) visiting this week and we plan on going to a museum in an hour. I have my daughter (5 mo) in a stroller. We decided to go to the museum via public transportation where the destination station doesn't have an elevator to get to the street level. \n\nMy husband (33 m) won't be joining us on this trip and I expressed that it may be hard to get out of the station with no elevator. My husband suggests that we should carry the entire stroller up/down the stairs or escalator as is (not folded) with the help of my sisters where one would hold the handle and another holding the front/wheels area.\n\nI think this is incredibly dangerous to do with a baby and say I'd rather take off the baby seat, fold the carriage and have one of my family members carry the folded stroller while I have the baby seat with baby. This turned into a huge argument with him saying it's a skill issue if we can't do it his way. I told him his idea is delusional, saying we've watched multiple videos of people before fail at doing this with other objects. I then said there's no reasoning with him and that I was done with him.\n\nSo AITA\n\nUpdate: Thank you everyone for your comments. Just a quick mention that both my husband and I crafted the post and we both read what you all said separately. After reading, my husband apologized for being argumentative. He felt like he needed to defend his idea after I dismissed it the first time. I apologized for calling his idea delusional. Apparently a lot of you do it even though I've never seen it myself. But to be fair, I also don't take public transportation regularly. I still will go through with my idea because I don't know what I'd do if I messed up and had to watch my infant just tumble down the stairs or escalator so I guess it is, in fact, a skill issue.",

      "scenario_description": "My son (8) and I (40f) flew home for the school holidays. I would have been content not to see my brother and his family, but I agreed to spend the weekend with them as my son and mum enjoy spending time with them. My nephew (6) had been unwell overnight. I questioned how sick he was and whether we should be going. I didn't want us get sick for our own sake, but also because he wouldn't be able to see his ore family. Mum was annoyed but spoke to my brother, who said nephew was fine, they were just tired after a rough night, we should still come. Mum and I were going to look after all the kids on Saturday night while my brother and his wife went to a party...probably why he was so keen for us to come; they  hadn't factored us into their weekend otherwise. My hesitation was met with an icy demeanour from mum so I agreed to go, lest the rest of our trip be ruined by her mood. When we arrived it was clear my nephew was still quite unwell. He was on the lounge with a sick bucket. My brother even remarked, \"yeah, he's really unwell\". Turns out he'd been vomiting overnight with a fever. My mother made it clear through her demeanour and tone that I was meant to pretend all was fine. I was too furious and uncomfortable to do that. Similar scenarios have happened before, resulting in my son, husband, and I  becoming quite unwell. My brother then left with the kids to pick his daughter (9) up from her first birthday party of the day. I told my mum it was really disrespectful that they'd done this again, and that I was absolutely furious. I could have been more calm and more diplomatic, but the gaslighting and denial of my right to be and express upset was too much. I asked for their street address so I could book a taxi home for me and my son. She insisted that she would leave too, although she eventually agreed that I could drive her car back if my brother could drive her home on the Sunday. He couldn't do that as he and his wife had too many plans, notwithstanding our visit. So we all left and the rest of our stay with her (2 days) was either silent treatment or ice cold responses. I tried to talk to her about how hurtful it was to be treated like that, which only made it worse.  I told her we won't be coming back for a while and, although I didn't say this, I've decided we'll stay in a hotel when we do return. ",

      "scenario_description": "Ok, so I (49f) was on vacation with my husband (51m) my son(18m) and son’s gf(18f). We were in Bermuda, where wild chickens are kind of everywhere. \n\nWe went to one of those touristy attractions so the kids could do a tour. Hubby and I have toured this attraction enough over the years so we just gave the kids a ride and were waiting outside.\n\nBefore the tour started, the staff directed us to sit under a tent and wait for the guide. There were a few chickens about. A couple of hens had very young chicks. Other people showed up and seemed to like the chickens but weren’t interested in them.\n\nThen a family of five came. Mom and dad on their phones. Oldest son too cool for his siblings. Daughter (12ish) declared that she was going to catch a chick. I knew this was unlikely as they are good at disappearing in the brush.  Well, daughter got too close and the mother hen squawked and jumped at her. This upset the youngest son(10ish) who started chasing the hen, swinging a stick at her. She was clearly panicking and desperately trying to get away.  \n\nI immediately rushed over (as I was on my way, the kid threw the stick at the hen) and told him not to throw things at animals. Then told him to go to his parents. I was very firm in my statement.\n\nI returned to my family as the kid’s father was asking him if he threw something at an animal. Since the kid denied it, I said, “Yeah, he just threw a stick at a chicken.” \n\nThe dad didn’t say word one to the kid about his actions. Instead, he snapped at me saying, “we’re his parents!” Indicating himself and the kids’ apparent mom. \n\nSo I replied, “Good. Then parent.” I admit I was matching his tone. He just shook his head and said “wow” over and over in a really angry tone. \n\nI felt that I was right to address the situation directly with the child as it was quickly escalating into violence and I was sincerely concerned for the safety of that mom and her babies. But was I TA? Should I have asked the parents to notice and prevent their kid’s actions?",

We met way before the movie starts so that we could talk and get to know each other better and honestly everything went great, we had an amazing date, we talked and kissed and walked around, etc. It was very fun and the chemistry was great.\n\nNow this last monday night we were texting each other when in the middle of the conversation i said that i needed to leave for a few hours because i couldn't use my phone where i was, i didn't explained why and just said that i needed to leave and would be back later, when she answered me i've already felt that something was off but i didn't thought much of it. When i got back she's even weirder and when i asked if everything was ok she just said it was a feeling of distrust, then i explained to her that it was something related to my personal life and that i tell very few people about it, but she answered saying that i'm a person that vanishes all of a sudden and that if that's the case then we should stop at one date only, she also said that she wanted me to have told her what it was so it wouldn't be weird later and that if already started wrong it would only get worse. I even told her what it was (i won't get into details but it was nothing wrong) and when she realized that it in fact it was nothing wrong she just said that there was no reason in hiding it and that just shows what kind o person i may be in the future. Was i really a terrible person? I apologized and said that it was not my intention to make her feel that way but i cannot help the fact i felt like a total asshole.",

      "scenario_description": "I am a camp counselor (25M) who works with elementary aged boys. To give some context, I am incredibly short and fat. Like, I am under 5 feet tall and around 200 pounds. This does not affect my ability to do my job. I'm just as active as any other counselor, I work with the kids just as much.I have to get blood tests done regularly for unrelated reasons (related to why I'm so short) and there's never really any concern when it comes to my cholesterol or insulin or anything weight related. I'm just saying this so you have some context for my general appearance and the fact that no, my weight doesn't affect my health or my level of activity.\n\nMy co-counselor is a guy around my age who is (I think) a baseball player. We could not look more different. He's got more than a foot of height on me and probably about the same weight, so he's obviously more visibly fit. He brags a lot about how even after we spend all day chasing kids in the sun, he still goes to the gym for a couple of hours. \n\nThe issue is when it comes to actually having to use strength practically, I out do him every time. I'm not trying to do it intentionally. But when we have to carry 20 kids backpacks and he can only handle 8 while I have 12, or when he can't open a jar, or when we have to lug heavy equipment and he's huffing and puffing while I'm not having a problem, it becomes pretty evident that I am just stronger than him, at least for stuff like that. I'm sure he could out bench me or whatever proper fitness stuff is, and trust me he crushes me when we play sports with the kids, I'm just talking about that kind of work.\n\nThe issue is that the kids have started to pick up on the fact that I am the \"strong counselor\". If they want to be picked up or can't open something in their lunch or want a break from carrying their bag on a hike, they come to me. Apparently, my co-counselor complained to one of the other counselors that I am \"embarrassing\" him because a guy like me shouldn't be able to be stronger than him. That counselor then came to me and told me I should tone it done because it can be hard for someone who prides themself on being an athlete to be worse at something than a guy \"like me\". I said there was no way I was going to do my job worse just to protect hit ego, and the other counselor said I was being a jerk and as the summer goes on the boys might start bullying my co-counselor if they think he's weaker than me, which I don't think is going to happen but I'm not sure. \n\nAITA for not wanting to stop doing my job the way I'm doing it so that I don't hurt this guys feelings?",

      "scenario_description": "I (27NB) live with my Mom (58F) and Sister (24F). I used to pay my mom \"rent\" to contribute to household costs. However, this has long been a point of contention for two main reasons.\n\n1) Despite also being an adult, my Sister was never required to pay rent by my Mom. This double standard felt incredibly unfair to me;\n\n2) The rent I paid gave me no rights/control whatsoever over my room by her admission, resulting in the incident that led me to stop paying her.\n\nThe incident:\n\nMy grandma was visiting from out of town and my mom decided to move her into my room while I was out despite the fact that, like I said, I work from home most of the time while both Mom and Sister work out of the home. Also important to point out is that I'm autistic, and it's really important to me to be able to work from my room as it's my comfortable, safe space, arranged as I like. My productivity drops like a rock if I'm forced to work from any other place in the house.\n\nI pointed both these facts out to my Mom and concluded that since my Sister's room has a single bed and Granny is a restless sleeper who might fall out, the best solution would be for her to sleep in my Mom's bedroom. Since my Mom and I have nearly identical sleep schedules during the week, we could share my bedroom at night, and she'd be gone in the morning before I started working. \n\nBut she didn't want to. First, because that meant she had to pick her outfits the day before and move them to my bedroom (oh no, what a hassle /s) and then because her, Sister and I would all have to share a bathroom and leave the in-suite bathroom to my grandma (we were currently all sharing the in-suite bathroom because Sister didn't want to share a bathroom with grandma). Then she ran out of excuses and simply said she didn't want to.\n\nI got angry because she wasn't giving me any good reasons so I told her I was going to move granny's things to her bedroom whether she liked it or not because I had an important project and I needed to work. She shot back I had no right to do that because she owned this house, and I answered that I pay for my room so I have a right to it.\n\nMy Mom laughed and said that what I pay is contributions to the household and that she owns my room and can do whatever she pleases with it. I answered that if contributing to the household as her child gave me less rights then a tenant I was not paying anything anymore.\n\nI've stuck with it for two months now but she keeps trying to guilt trip me saying she needs the money for household expenses. But at the same time, she won't charge my Sister anything and I have word from family members that her finances are very well off, she's just paranoid about money.\n\nAITA?\n\nReason I might be the Asshole: She's my mother and owns the house, we have no formal contract, therefore no matter how much I pay I have no inherent right to my room. Plus whether she charges my Sister rent or not is technically none of my business.",

Okay so my mother passed away in 2021 and since then her house had been pretty much just sitting. We had done some work on fixing up the house fixing floor walls repainting etc but the outside of the house I'll admit was trashy and need to be cleaned. All the trash and everything was on the front porch which is a big wooden porch wide enough to fit maybe 2 cars on. That porch is older than me and my oldest brother who is in his mid 20s. My family decided that they'd clean it up you know how nice of them but as a part of their cleaning they not only took the trash off the porch but also destroyed the entire porch and burned it in her yard. The porch while old and having a few spots that are messed up was still very usable. I was and still am missed at the fact that they did this but even then thats not the worst part me and my brother only found out by seeing a post on Instagram they didn't ask or even tell us that it had been done. The house was my mom place on family owned land but as far as I know there is no type of writing or contract to say they have permission to do things like. Am I overreacting or am I rightfully pissed",

I know that sounds crazy but my religious family has always judged and looked down on me. So I believed her and went back to dating men. I had another child and after that I finally found the courage to date women again. I had a serious girlfriend and I told my sister about it. Aside from some mildly judgey comments she actually supported the relationship. Until I told her I was planning on coming out to mom and dad. She was adamantly against it. To the point that I left her house and cried all the way to my girlfriend’s house. Long story short but I don’t spend much time around my family now. Im basically low contact with all of them. I’m so strong away from them but so weak around them. Recently my sister planned an outing with me, her and mom. This is always tense for me but it went ok. Then my sister is telling me she’d love to go see a drag show, because she’s not homophobic, right? So the pick me came out in me and I told her I’d take her to pride. She also suggested our 82yr mom joins us. I know if I went with them my mom would say a bunch of Karen comments and I don’t care how open my sister appears to the world, I know how she is and I can’t shake the things she said before. So should I risk being with problem people at a place I feel safe, or should I just “forget” to tell her. \n\nAlso, before it comes up, if I had the ability to confront my family I would have done it a long time ago. I wish I could, but I just can’t. ",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for leaving my roommate at the apartment by herself for some days during the week? \n\nHi everyone!!! Looking for genuine opinions here! \n\nFor some context, I am a 21 year old college student living with another friend that is my age. However, we go to college in the same town that we grew up in, so both of our parents live just down the road. We are privileged enough to live away from our parents in an apartment on our own to get the “college experience” and to see what it’s like living independently. I am an only child and am quite used to being independent as is, but my roommate is very much in constant need of having some sort of company (she grew up with a sister so I completely understand why!). While I have no issue going to places by myself or being at the apartment alone during the day, she seems to be the opposite. If I am unable to go with her places or am gone from the apartment she can get extremely passive aggressive. Being an only child, I am extremely close to my parents and do love spending time with them. So, some days during the week when I don’t have work or school, I will go run errands with my mom and spend the day at my parents house…sometimes from the afternoon all the way until 9-10 pm. If my roommate does not have plans that day and is at the apartment by herself (and knows I’m with my parents) she will freeze me out for the rest of the day/days afterwards. It is so uncomfortable and makes me uneasy, and also makes me feel guilty for spending the day with my parents. I almost feel like it’s not even worth it anymore bc I can’t even enjoy the day, I’m just so worried about making her upset. Am I being insensitive for just wanting to do my own thing sometimes? I understand that she was raised differently so she might not be as used to being by herself all the time, but she could go to her parents house if she was that lonely considering they live just down the road too. Please give honest feedback!!! Am I the problem here?? ",

Giving you the cold shoulder so you don't even want to do your own things around instead of using her words is manipulative. You need to have a talk about this with her when you both are calm and explain that you are her roommate, that you like spending time with her and will occasionally do it, but she cannot rely on you to always be there and always be the one who goes with her to places. If that does not help, I am afraid you two are not compatible roommates in the long run (and that's ok, not all friends are). It does not matter if you were raised differently or not. You have as much right to expect her to adjust to *your* needs and upbringing as she has to expect you to do the same.\n\nTechnical note: separation anxiety is an actual condition that refers to a specific kind of fear of separation from \"a close attachment figure\". You are her roommate, you do not qualify as an object of separation anxiety. That does not mean her anxiety would not be real; it means you are not a part of the treatment effort. If she *actually* has separation anxiety or another related mental health condition, she is already too old to not have had it treated and having planned *her own* coping mechanisms. You are not her therapist or professional support and she cannot expect you to become one. If she has a mental health anxiety condition behind this behavior, you will *not* help her by becoming a crutch that allows her to put off dealing with it herself.",

She also have a really bad habit of acting like she is his mother and throwing HUGE hissy fits when she doesn’t get her way. So I planned my fiancé and mine wedding completely on my own just bc of her. I did share a few things with my mom and sister but for the most part I kept things to myself including the color I wanted the parents to wear at our wedding bc I did not want her wearing it bc she is not a parent and I talk to my fiancé and said that he would find disrespectful due to them not being close and the situation on how she ending up dating his dad. She has said that if she doesn’t get to wear the color then his dad cannot officiate our wedding. The sad thing is I had seen this coming so I prepared a back up officiate. I’m worried this will hurt my relationship with his family and hurt his relationship with his dad. \n\nOh I also forgot to mention this isn’t the only boundary I had to put is place for our wedding bc of her. So the gf and the bio mom due not get along. It no fault of the bio mom it’s all the gf, but I had to get security to make sure that the gf doesn’t cause a fight with the bio mom. I honestly think it’s so funny how the bio mom deals with her she just smiles and walks away every time the gf try’s and start something.",

I said no I made a spicy curry on one night and I put another couple of portions in the freezer, she burst out laughing and saying \"oh no is that what that was, I threw it away\" I thought she was joking at first but from the way she carried on laughing I started to think she meant it, I checked the freezer and it was gone. \n\nI got really angry I called her a b*tch and a c*nt (context, here in the UK that word is thrown around a lot more casually than the US) I kept throwing snide remarks at her over the following hours. She kept saying I should have told her that was mine. Even though I'd told her before she left I was planning on making a spicy curry as she can't handle spicy food and that was my opportunity to have it. And she'd just got home not long before me and found time to do that. I left her really upset and she refused to eat dinner and has been giving me the silent treatment since.",

No matter what the answer, you should not have called her those words. There is a difference between throwing around four-letter words in a friendly conversation about objects or frustrations or whatever, and calling someone those words in anger. An adult who does not know the difference or pretends not to qualifies as an asshole for the context of this sub.

      "scenario_description": "Hi 24M. I know this needs context, so I'll try and make it simple. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are just getting to the point of taking showers with each other while we're at each others places. The current problem I'm having is that I was on the toilet doing my business, when I was done I did the required paper work and then washed my hands. That all sounds normal to me. My girlfriend was in the bathroom with me, do to us getting ready to take a shower together. \n\nShe watched me wash my hands and asked me what I was doing, then scolded me for it. He logic was that since we were getting in the shower, washing my hands was pointless. I thought she was joking, so I laughed and said that was gross. I'm not touching anything with my soiled hands like that. She interpreted that as me calling her gross. \n\nSo I had to ask, does she always get right into the shower after using the toilet without washing them first? Apparently she doesn't wash her hand. She just gets right into the shower. Now I'm somehow an asshole because I don't want to spread my poop germs around my bathroom more than what flushing already does. \n\nNow it's turned into an argument. We didn't shower together and instead of having a nice day like we planed, I drove her home.\n\nI don't get it, who doesn't wash their hand immediately after wiping? If I'm home, I don't even pull my pants up until I wash my hands. \n\nI asked a few guy friends about it and they're all on my side, so I thought it might be a girl thing. So I called the only girls in my life i can ask such a stupid question. First i tried my older sister 38F, to which i got scolded for even considering not washing my hands. The lady practically raised me. Then I tried my younger sister 22F, she was on my girlfriends side. So I don't know.\n\n  \nAITA for washing my hands after using the bathroom even though I was getting in the shower anyways? ",

It sounds like the shower and sink are in the same room or very close (since she saw you doing it your way), so it's not like anyone's wondering around the house touching things with poopy hands. \n\nJust get over it, wash your own hands the way you like, let her wash hers the way she likes it.

I told her I didn’t hear her, because of how far away she was and the noise in my ear. She says I should’ve been able to hear her anyways (mind you, she can barely understand what I say if the door is shut with me on the same floor). I responded saying just that, asking if she tried to call me instead. She said, “no, I wouldn’t call you if you were in the bathroom with the door shut, you could’ve been taking a shower.” I responded, “if you wouldn’t call because I wouldn’t hear you, then why would you yell from downstairs with the door shut and with water running?” To which she just walked away. \n\n\n\nI went downstairs a few minutes later and asked if she was okay. She said she was, asking why I was wondering. I kept a level head, replying,” I thought we were having a good day, and then you got upset with me all of a sudden.” She went on about how she called 6 times (suddenly higher). I told her I usually answer her calls immediately, and since we had a good day so far, why would I do something like that? She replied, “I thought you had gotten upset out of nowhere, it didn’t make any sense.” She said I was interrogating her, and that I was taking liberties I shouldn’t have, and that it wasn’t a debate. I ended up getting upset and saying I didn’t care anymore, and why should I bother being civil with someone who’s not even trying. I left and went upstairs with mom saying I should respect her more. \n\n\n\nAs I waited to go, I sat on the stairwell until mom showed up again, saying I needed to talk to her nicer. That if I said that to her, imagine what I’m saying to other people. I asked her what she wanted me say to begin with, to which she replied, “you could’ve just said ‘I’m sorry mom, I couldn’t hear you.’” I told her that’s what I led with, laughing in shock. She said I was being dramatic, to which I said she was horrible. She asked me to repeat what I said, and I did because I meant it. She told me that although I was smart, I didn’t have wisdom down pat yet, and that I should’ve apologized immediately. I responded saying,” well I guess it’s cause I don’t have it down pat yet.” I ended up apologizing later, and I admit I did end up sounding a lil too much like a moody teenager for my age, I take full responsibility for my disrespect in that regard. I wanted to get a second opinion on if I was extra rude and if the argument was fully my fault.\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I 28F has been married for 6 months now I live with my super loving husband and MIL. My MIL tho is not what I expected her to be at first she was good but then lately she started to create problems between me and my husband. I've been hearing quite a lot about her problematic behaviour from my sister in law's but I used to brush them of thinking if MIL is good to me then I need not to worry about her. \n\nNow the drama part she wants me to talk to people who she talks to, and not to talk with people who she has started beef with. earlier she was okay with me talking with them, bcz she was talking with them but then now she has a beef with them. She wants me to stop talking with them now that friends with them (them being my husband's eldest brothers family) and stop going to their house which I think is unfair. I can’t be controlled like that like I need to have my own space and control on my own life. I am not a puppet. \n\nso now that I’m not listening to her. She started abusing me literally cursing me because I was not listening to her. I told my husband about that and he understandably talked to her mother. but she won’t listen to anybody. \n\nA few weeks ago she was fighting with me, bcz I went to their house she went crazy she said so many bad things about me and my period. I literally started to cry when I was standing in the kitchen and half of the things I forgot what she said, (that’s how I am)\n\nand I don’t know if she cursed my parents or not. It seems like she did. I didn’t hear it properly, but I feel like she did, and I took it to the sky. I was furious, and I was so so mad. ( Rightfully so) And when my husband got back from work. She told him her perspective and painted me bad, which was very weird. like hello, you were the one who started the fight. You were the one who cursed me and my parents, you were the one put it all the wrong things and now I am the bad person???\n\n\nThen later, my husband asked me about the situation and I told him the truth, but about the part where she cursed my parents or not I thought she did, so I told my husband she did and thankfully my husband was mad on her mom too as to why to bring my parents in a fight they don't even know is happening. \n\n\nMy MIL was saying she does not want to stay with me and that she wants to go to her daughters house. My husband used to stop her before this fight but this time he didn’t. so now I don’t know if I am the bad one like, I think I am taking advantage of the situation because I am not completely sure if she did or not, she like used to mumble things, and I think I heard her curse my parents, which was very wrong, of course but then I don’t know if she did or not. ( English is not my first language so bare with me).",
