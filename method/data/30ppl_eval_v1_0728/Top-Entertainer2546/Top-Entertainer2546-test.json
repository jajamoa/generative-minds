      "scenario_description": "I’m 26F and had been living with a roommate for almost two years. We renewed our lease back in March for another full year. Things were pretty normal, no major drama, we split rent and utilities evenly and mostly did our own thing.\n\nA few weeks ago, my roommate got a new job in another city. Cool, good for them. But they gave me two weeks’ notice that they were moving out and had already spoken to the landlord about getting their name off the lease. No plan, no subletter lined up, nothing. Just “I figured you could cover things for a while until you find someone.”\n\nI told them that wasn’t going to work for me. I didn’t agree to live alone and I definitely can’t afford this place on my own. They brushed it off and basically said I should be supportive of their “big opportunity” and that I’d figure something out.\n\nFast forward to moving day and they asked if I’d help them carry furniture, load the U-Haul, clean, etc. I told them no. I said I didn’t feel right helping out after the way they left me with everything. They got really cold after that and told some of our mutual friends that I was being bitter and making their move more stressful out of spite.\n\nNow some people are saying I should’ve just helped to be the bigger person and that it wouldn’t have killed me to lift a few boxes. Others agree with me and say it was pretty bold of them to expect help after bailing.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to help my roommate move out after they dumped the lease on me?",

      "comment_text": "NTA.  I am not a lawyer, and don't trust legal advice here.  However, if you both signed the lease with the landlord, in many states that means you are both \"jointly and separately responsible\" for paying the rent.  Meaning\n\nYou are responsible for paying 100% of the rent  AND\n\nYour roommate is responsible for paying 100% of the rent.\n\nIn other words, she doesn't have to \"be off the lease\".  She doesn't even have to move out.  She can stay, pay no rent, and the landlord can collect 100% from you.  The landlord has a right to 100% of the rent each month and doesn't get involved in which roommate pays how much.\n\nYour best bet is to search for a new roommate is fast as possible, then sue this ex roomie in Small Claims Court for any rent and utilities she owes you until the new roomie moves in.  Or you move too, properly terminate the lease with the current landlord, and sue the ex roomie for her share of rent, termination fees and your moving costs.  And do check with the landlord about ex roomie being \"off the lease\".  If he did take her off without your consent, he likely broke the law, invalidated the lease, and you can move without any termination fees (but you'd likely have to take him to court to get the deposit back and resolve everything).\n\nYour ex roomie is certainly an AH.  The right thing for her to do was to promptly help you search for a new roommate, and pay her share of rent until the new roomie moves in as long as you are being fair and reasonable about choosing a new roommate.  And then the 3 of you work with the landlord to get ex roomie off the lease and new roomie on the lease.",

      "scenario_description": "This is mostly about my daughter-in-law (Kat). Her mother ran out on her when she was a child, and she went into foster care. According to my son, she’s currently seeing a therapist.\n\nMy issue with Kat is that she has repeatedly stomped on my boundaries. She’s a very touchy person, she  refuses to call me by my name and only refers to me as “Mom.” I correct her every time since I’m not comfortable being called “Mom” by her, and I want her to use my name.\n\nThere have been multiple times where she’s asked inappropriate questions, mostly about why I’m not close to my own mother. (For context, my mother was horrible) Kat keeps pushing for details and insists I should get closer to her because “family sticks together.” She basically tells me to forgive my mom, and she doesn’t understand not being close with one’s parents. I’ve told her to drop the topic multiple times, and she refuses. Because of all this, I’m not a huge fan of hers.\n\nI’ve spoken to my son about it, and he asked me to be patient. I’ve also talked to Kat multiple times and asked her to respect my boundaries. She always says she will, but then goes right back to ignoring them.\n\nThis is where I might be the jerk: My daughter Sam (20) and I are taking a weekend trip. Sam has medical issue and needs to see a specialist a few states over. She hasn’t disclosed the issue to the rest of the family yet (she plans to when she has a firm plan).\n\nSomehow, word about the trip got back to Kat, and she called me asking why she wasn’t invited. I told her it’s an important trip and not a fun one. She accused me of lying, claiming it was a “mother-daughter” trip that she was excluded from. I told her again this is not a girls’ trip. She wouldn’t let it go and started demanding that she come, saying that she’s my daughter and needs to be there. I said no again. She kept insisting, saying I am her “mom”and she has to come on this trip since is my kid. That’s when I snapped. I told her I will never be her mother. Just because she married my son does not make me her parent. I told her to leave me the fuck alone and that even if this was a mother-daughter trip, she still wouldn’t be invited, because she isn’t my kid. I then hung up. \n\nMy son says I need to apologize and invite her. That I am a huge dick to her. That I was way out of line and need to make it up to Kat. The situation has spread to the rest of the family, and everyone seems to have their own opinion. Sam is getting flack too, which isn’t helping especially since she doesn’t want to disclose the reason for the trip yet.\n\nAm I being an asshole and need to apologize even tho those are my true feelings on her trying to make me her parent.",

      "scenario_description": "Some context first: let’s call them “Team Priorities.”\n\nSince the beginning of our relationship, I learned my husband is the go-to person for family when it comes to money. Once we got serious and started a family of our own, we agreed to stop the handouts. We’re not wealthy by any means, but when we’re in a tight spot, we hustle and make it work without asking others for help.\n\nBut every now and then, “Team Priorities” sneaks back in and asks my husband to help cover a bill or some urgent expense. The frustrating part is the timing—shortly after asking for money, the fiancée is often posting about new outfits, day trips, or looking for tattoo artists. It’s hard not to feel taken advantage of.\n\nTheir latest visit really frustrated me. They said they wanted to come see us so the kids could spend time together (they’re close in age). We agreed and let them stay with us, thinking it was for quality family time. Wrong. They treated our house like a free Airbnb. We saw them one full day and briefly in the evenings—otherwise, they were off doing their own thing. Our daughter was really disappointed, which left me annoyed and honestly, a little sour.\n\nThen came the kicker.\n\nA week after they left, my husband got an alert that his credit score dropped 30 points. Turns out his cousin (the groom) missed a car payment. My husband co-signed that loan before we ever met. So they came to stay with us knowing they were in default—and didn’t say a word. Meanwhile, that missed payment affected our financial standing.\n\nI was livid. I wanted to message the fiancée and tell her to get their act together because it’s beyond disrespectful. My husband and I argued about it. He said I shouldn’t get involved and that the fiancée has nothing to do with the loan. But we’ve tried to get him removed from the loan and can’t—his cousin’s credit is too low. I even asked why the fiancée (soon to be wife!) couldn’t take over the loan, but my husband brushed it off, saying there’s only a year left.\n\nAfter sitting with it, I decided I’m not attending their wedding. My husband is still going—he’s the best man. But our daughter is starting kindergarten that same week, and I don’t want her missing those first days. Plus, she’s attending private school, so every penny counts, and I made it clear there will be no gift from us and he won’t be footing the entire bill for the bachelor trip either.\n\nIf it weren’t for the kids, I’d have stepped back from this relationship a long time ago. The fiancée gives off strong narcissistic/toxic vibes—but that’s another post.\n\nSo, AITA for skipping the wedding and refuse to gift them anything?",

Next time someone says they really need the money for whatever, he should discuss it with you.  If you agree, then offer to pay only directly to the party they need to pay.  If they need $500 for rent, you pay the landlord directly.  And if they still brag about the new tattoo, no more gift money.",

      "scenario_description": "I 23F moved out 6 months ago. I was In a toxic situation at home with parents who would fight constantly and were controlling. My dad was a narcissist and was being emotionally abusive and manipulative to my mom. I had been looking at apartments for a year, my parents knew I wanted to move out and had gone to a showing or two with me. They never came to any other showings because the first one went badly and they believed i was making the wrong choice. \n\nI continued looking for apartments. It was the most difficult and emotionally draining year of my life with the constant emotional instability at home. Things got really bad and I finally had enough. I found an apartment within my budget and close to work and told my mom about it, saying I was serious about it. She told me to hold off so we could “discuss things.” Every time we had “discussions” it was really them finding reasons to convince me not to move out, offer me a more “viable” solution or promise me things would get better at home soon. I decided to sign the lease, and told them after the fact that I had done so. This led to a week or so of constant arguments, them demanding that I cancel my lease and making me feel terrible. I tried explaining that things were so toxic that I had to remove myself but nothing I said seemed to matter. I was told I was being selfish, not thinking straight and was making a mistake I was going to regret. The day I moved out was awkward and despite not regretting my choice, I felt terrible for upsetting my family and betraying their trust by leaving them out of the decision. They didn’t help me with the moving process which I didn’t make them feel bad about. Once I finally was out, the distance felt like a relief and I went some time without contacting them as I wanted to breathe and gather my thoughts. \n\nFlash forward to now, 6 months later and my family is resentful towards me. My decision to move out (along with other behaviours such as prioritizing me and my happiness, focusing on my relationship with my boyfriend, and distancing myself) has caused a lot of resentment towards me. I’ve been told that they will never get over what I did, and that if I don’t get my act together and start making better decisions, I will end up alone. I’ve asked what I can do to help mend things (despite the fact that I’ve been the only one proactively reaching out and seeking some sort of connection for normalcy) but was basically told that I should know what I have to do. My apologies for betraying them seem to hold no value, justifying my actions just make me seem selfish and I don’t know what to do. While I accept the blame and part I played, I also feel like they’re holding a grudge over me. We’ve always been a very tight knit family with the expectation of full transparency so it’s been a shock to the entire family and a struggle for everyone involved. I’m at a loss and don’t know if I am really the asshole here?",

      "comment_text": "NTA  Your parents have been mentally and emotionally abusive to you for years, and you are only just barely beginning to realize it.  You and your parents weren't \"close\", they were controlling you.  Their relationship with you wasn't \"transparent\", they never allowed you to develop appropriate boundaries in the relationship, never allowed you privacy and the right to make perfectly reasonable decisions for yourself, like moving out.\n\nI understand you want them to be happy for you.  Their anger and demeaning statements (you'll end up alone) are just more abuse you've been conditioned to accept as \"we're they only people who love you enough to tell you the truth about how worthless and stupid you are\".  They will never give you the relationship and love and approval you want from them, because that's who they are.  They will only accept a relationship with you if you allow them to continue abusing you.  They are mad because by moving out, you've taken a huge healthy step to reduce their opportunities to abuse you.\n\nTheir shunning of you is a gift.  Stop reaching out for now, and use this time away from them to heal.  Consider getting counseling.  Lean into the new healthy relationships with people who don't mistreat you.  Recognize when being loved feels GOOD-soothing, encouraging, uplifting, safe.  That's the way love is supposed to feel.  Just...breathe, relax, really notice how unfamiliar and wonderful it feels to live without their daily abuse.  That's how life is supposed to feel.\n\nI know because I am you a few decades later.  I moved out without permission too.  My parents spent years telling me I couldn't do anything, no one would ever give me a job, no man would ever love me, I was too tall (and many other weird and specific criticisms of my body) and I believed every abusive and demeaning word.  Like you, I knew I just had to get out.  Ultimately, they couldn't accept my boundaries and independence.  So they staged a blow out emotional attack on the day of my college graduation, screaming at me in their car about how I ruined my own graduation, I ruin everything, its all my fault, I was always disrespectful and ...I don't remember everything.  They couldn't just be nice and happy for me on the biggest day of my life.  And as I walked away in tears, they rolled down the windows and called out to me very sweetly \"we love you\".  And I finally understood.  All my life I accepted their verbal abuse and control as love, because they always ended their vicious verbal abuse by saying they loved me.  And I turned and told them \"No you don't.  This isn't how you treat someone you love.  You love the 5 year old I used to be.  You don't love the woman I am.\"  We've been estranged ever since, and I'm at peace with that.  I don't want or need abusive people in my life.",

      "scenario_description": "Hey im an old guy who has never posted on reddit, but at the urging of my neice and nephew I'm going to attempt to post this here :)\n\nSo I (50M) have a neice and a nephew who are both 18 and just graduated. A few years ago when they were entering HS I made a deal with them, if they kept a B average their entire time in high school I would buy them any car of their choosing, within reason of course. We added a clause that they got 1 semester forgiven, so they were able to mess up one semester and I wouldn't hold it against them, I felt like 7/8 semesters with a b average was pretty fair. \n\nSo my neice maintained her grades, she did mess up her sophomore year but otherwise was right on track. My nephew on the other hand pretty much never did right, we were lucky that he even passed every semester. I offered help, tutors, books, tried to make sure he was okay mentally, whatever he needed but turns out he just straight up was not doing his work. He was doing good on tests but would never do his actual work resulting in his grades being low. \n\nSo last week was when my neice got her car, she choose a 2025 Toyota camry. My nephew kept asking when he was going to get his, and I told him he didn't stick to his end of the agreement so he did not get a car. He still got a very nice gift back at graduation.

      "scenario_description": "My (36, M) sister (34, F) moved into my house about 2 months ago with her 2 kids (7M, 4F) after she ended a really bad relationship\n\nI’ve always been an early-ish riser and like to get up and make myself some breakfast around 7 or 8am. Nothing spectacular, just whatever I felt like that day\n\nWhen my sister moved in, I realized quickly that she liked to sleep in. Some days she was up as late as 1pm…I gave her the benefit of the doubt since I knew how hard her break up was for her \n\n\nSince my sister slept so late daily, she wouldn’t get up and take care of her kids. I got into a routine with my niece and nephew that basically whatever I cooked myself for breakfast, I’d make enough for them as well until the other morning \n\nI woke up and had an urge to make huevos rancheros. The kids immediately started complaining that they didn’t want that and wanted something different\n\nI was nice and ended up making them pancakes since it’s not their fault that their mom is really struggling \n\nThe next morning, I was making breakfast potatoes and eggs but all I heard was “we don’t want that. We want something different” so again, I obliged…finally after 3 mornings of my unwanted food critics getting a separate meal, I finally told them “I’m no longer cooking 2 different meals for breakfast. If you don’t like what I’m making, go ask your mom to get up and do it”\n\nSo, they went upstairs to wake her up, but she still didn’t come downstairs until after 1pm. The kids immediately started complaining that I “refused to feed them” and my sister was PISSED\n\nShe started in about how they need to be fed by a certain time and a bunch of other things that she said to try and intentionally hurt me\n\nI snapped and told her “look I know you’re depressed, but wake up and take care of your fu**ing kids instead of expecting me to do it”\n\nShe got quiet after that and is still giving me the cold shoulder, but I know she’s expecting me to apologize.\n\nSorry this was long winded, but let me have it. AITA?\n\n",

Sounds like your sister has spent 2 months wallowing in self pity and avoiding her responsibilities.   That's 7 weeks too long.  You are doing her a favor by providing her with temporary housing, she needs to take responsibility for herself and her kids by taking care of the kiddos herself, keeping reasonable hours, looking for a job, housing, child support, public benefits if she needs them.  I don't know if sis is just lazy, or if she is mentally ill.  Either way, you do her and the kids no favors by enabling her to avoid all of this.

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

She was my world and my rock and everything made sense around her. I could talk about her all day but that would take too long to write down and I would probably break down in tears anyway;) \nAfter she passed away due to a horrible freak accident, I fell into a depression that led to me drinking away my feelings. This completely altered my life for the worse, I lost my apartment, my friends, my family and my life. I had absolutely no one and my parents were so ashamed of me that they refused to let me live with them. And my sister? She claimed she was living in an apartment that was way too small and that she couldn’t house me. I ended up being hopeless and desperate for a long long time. \n\nSix years and a million AA meetings later, I am now fully sober with a kid on the way:) I never kept contact with my family after what happened, instead I focused on myself and met the love of my life. \nFast forward to a month ago, my sister found my new number via an old friend and contacted me asking if she could stay at my house for awhile. She had lost her job and had been through a tough divorce and lost her house aswell (she had apparently sold the house my parents bought her to live with her partner and later lost the house due to the divorce). Obviously I refused, reminding her of how she treated me in the past.\n\nLast week, my parents& my sister somehow found my address and came to my house demanding to let my sister stay here. \nMy sister defended her past actions by revealing that she found out she was pregnant after my bestfriend passed away but never wanted to tell me due to the fact that I was grieving. She also didn’t want me to stay at her place because she was scared that I would somehow push her into also being an alcoholic and harm her kid. She said that her situation is different now because she already has kids, that her ex-husband has custody of, and that she wants to get her life together and needs my help. After a long discussion things were getting heated and I had to call the police. I am now thinking of filing a restraining order against them but my husband is telling me to “let my rage go” and help my family. I honestly don’t know what to do, I already feel super stressed whilst pregnant and have hormones jumping out of my ears, so that may also be the reason for me being extra angry. I need someones opinion on this situation who doesn’t know me, and I’m hoping for some advice!!\n\nPS: sorry for the super long post, and I also apologise for my english- I am not a native speaker!",

      "comment_text": "NTA  You have been estranged from your family for years, and even now you don't say they want to reconcile, or show any concern about you.  They  just want you to provide sister with free housing.  And I suspect your sister has some personal problems (like addiction maybe?) that they aren't telling you about.  She lost custody of her own kids, you gotta be pretty messed up for that to happen.  You don't want a virtual stranger who lost custody of their own kids living with YOUR NEWBORN!  Nope. No way.  \n\nI will say, you seem angry that your parents and sister didn't let you live with them when you were drinking.  They didn't owe you free housing when you were drinking.  The best most loving thing they could do for you was let you fall, let you live with the consequences of your alcoholism, so you could find your rock bottom and get sober ASAP.  The \"help\" you wanted from them wasn't help getting better, it was enabling of your drinking.  Now, they could have stayed in touch and provided emotional support, told you they loved you and were worried about you and wanted you to get sober.  Maybe they didn't do that, shame on them and you have a right to be hurt and angry about that.  But carrying that hurt and anger eats you up inside.  You do need to work on letting that go.  Not forgetting, but healing.  \n\nSo I do think your husband is partly right.  Don't be mad that they didn't enable you, be grateful for that.  And its a little too soon to think about a restraining order.  Wait and see if they've taken \"no\" as an answer.  But \"help your family\"?  No way.",

      "scenario_description": "I 27F have been friends with Ava 28F, since college. She got engaged last year to Max and took me to brunch with 5 other girls, to announce we were all bridesmaids for her wedding. Max wanted Ava to include his sister Mia, 25F, as a bridesmaid, which Ava agreed to. Ava has met Mia a couple of times and complained in the past that Mia is difficult.\n\nWe all went on a bachelorette holiday together, and Mia accused me of taking her earrings, as I was the last one to head out of the apartment after going to the bathroom at the other end of the Airbnb. I didn't take the earrings, and Mia made digs at me the whole 3 day trip about her earrings, even when I tried to explain. I was super upset that Ava didn't say anything to Mia, but told me that she believed me, and Ava's other friends were on my side. Mia found the earrings when we came back and didn't even reach out to apologise to me. After the trip, I sent Ava a message saying I was super upset she didn't stand up for me or say anything after Mia had found her earrings.\n\nAva didn't reply, and a few days later, I told her that I was going to drop out of the bridal party. She replied instantly to say that my dropping out would make the groomsmen an odd number and that it's too close to the wedding to make a drastic change.\n\nShe is having a destination wedding and has covered flights and a hotel for the wedding for me and my boyfriend bought his ticket and my boyfriend said that we could make it a holiday for us instead, since we've already taken the time off work and can't change it.",

But Ava was pressured into including her SIL, she told you she believed you, so I can understand that she didn't want to stir up more drama with Mia by telling Mia she didn't believe her.  And Mia found the earrings.  Hopefully, Mia or Ava posted that in the wedding chat so all the other bridesmaids know.  Weddings are stressful, don't blame the bride for not feeding Mia's drama.  You shouldn't have dropped out over this.\n\nYou are very very wrong to still use Ava's wedding as a vacation partially paid for by her when you dropped out of the bridal party for such a petty reason.  Reimburse her for lodging, flight, bridesmaid dress you keep, anything for the wedding trip that she was generous enough to pay for.  Its the least you can do.  Even if you don't travel to the wedding location but choose to vacation somewhere else, you ought to reimburse Ava.",

      "post_title": "WIBTA If I told my MIL she’s no longer welcome at the VRBO for our vacation in August?",
      "scenario_description": "I 28 (F) am married to my husband 32 (M) we got married in 2022 and since getting engaged things with my MIL have just gotten worse and worse over the years. We are going on a trip to WI in August to see my husbands extended family. Originally we planned to stay at an air bnb with my MIL, FIL, BIL and his fiancé. We booked the VRBO in Sept of 2024 and things with my MIL have really hit a tipping point\n\nIn Nov we found out we were pregnant with our second baby. My MIL never once congratulated me or even said anything about my pregnancy after my husband told them when they had lunch together without me in Feb. In early April we tragically lost our baby at 21 weeks when my water broke. My MIL never once checked in on my husband to see how everyone was doing after the loss of our baby and two trips to the ER due to complications. Every text and call she made after our loss was to see when she could see our living child because she HAD to see him and spend time with him. Flash forward to Easter, my MIL comes to Easter at my parents house and doesn't speak to me the entire time and did not once try to interact with our living child. She left Easter in a fit for an unknown reason, said goodbye to no one and sat in the car and cried. \n\nMIL has not spoken to us since Easter, including when my husband called and texted on Mother's Day. We learned from BIL that they had debated getting their own VRBO but realized how close it was to all the family we would be visiting. So she changed her mind and told BIL that she would stay at the VRBO with us still but would not speak to me or my husband. \n\nI want to tell her that she is no longer welcome to stay with us and that she needs to find her own place. Would I be the asshole? \n\n\n\nEDIT: Since many people have asked in the comments.\n\nI did try to interact with her at Easter, she would either brush me off or walk away. My husband interacted with her but at the end when she was leaving when my husband tried to say goodbye to her she just shook her head no and walked away to the car. We don’t know why she’s mad, we don’t know what happened, she’s not speaking to me or my husband and just started speaking to BIL again 2 weeks ago\n\nLeading up to this: our relationship went downhill when my husband and I got engaged but I tried for years before that to keep the peace and make everyone happy. I made sure my husband called her back and reached out, i made plans with them, bought every gift for her for every holiday, and tried to include her when I could in things. \n\nShe often goes months without speaking to us in the years leading up to this vacation. This is not new or uncommon at all. She does the same to BIL and his fiancé and she will go months with barely speaking to her own husband. \n\nWe got engaged in 2020, and before that I had a decent relationship with my MIL. We went on vacations and road trips together with no issues and we would text casually from time to time. The first issue was my bridal shower, my mom and MOH planned the shower and my mom asked MIL to help. MIL has a huge issue with her sister and doesn’t want to be around her but still goes to NFL games with her and sits 3 people away from her for all home games with no issues. Back to the bridal shower, my mom asked MIL to help and MIL cried and threw a fit saying she wouldn’t come to the shower if her sister was there. So my mom and MOH uninvited her sister to keep the peace. I didn’t know until after the event and got asked by his family why MIL sister wasn’t there and had to face handling that even though I wanted her there. After that it was the rehearsal dinner, MIL planned the whole thing without us even though we asked to be part of the planning. So we ended up having big Italian two nights in a row because she picked an Italian restaurant and we served Italian at the wedding. \n\nAfter that was missing our sons (her first grandchild’s) baby shower because we invited her sister and told her that her sister was invited beforehand so it wasn’t a shock to her. Again she sits 3 people away from her all football season. \n\nThen our son was born and we asked that we have some time to adjust to life as parents before having visitors (this applied to my parents too). She did not like having to wait the two weeks it took for us to feel ready. While he was little she was constantly telling us “it’s time that you do…” all regarding things with our son; letting her babysit, letting her kiss him, letting her feed him(he was exclusively breast fed), letting her take him out for the day, etc. \n\nThen at my son’s first birthday she took a video of everyone singing happy birthday to him and I was sitting right next to her. I magically didn’t make it into the video and when we asked her about it she said “I didn’t want to ruin the video” meaning she didn’t want to have to turn the orientation of the video to fit me into it. But you can clearly see in the video that when I lean in towards my son. She moves the camera away each time to try and keep me out of the video. \n\nThen to the loss of our second baby, she did not show up for us during our grief at all. Not once did she check in on us after we tragically lost a baby and only asked about seeing our living son. Not once did she offer help or ask what we needed. Just demanded to see our son while we were in thick of losing a baby halfway through a pregnancy. \n\nSo yes, I tried for years but I reached my point of no longer being able to try with her for my own sake and well being so I don’t try anymore and my husband knows this and is on board with me keeping my distance to protect myself. He knows I want low contact with her but that’s a difficult thing to do without also cutting down his contact with his dad. I take his lead on how much we see his parents and I would never stop him from seeing them. He also chooses to not see them much and to not bring our son to see them unless we’ve invited them to see him or it’s an event\n\nHope that helps clear things up",

She should be absolutely unwelcome at your VRBO.  \"Mom, this is a vacation for us and we want to relax and have fun.  You have refused to speak to us for months, and we simply aren't comfortable in your presence.  We refuse to let you treat us like that during our family vacation, so you will have to find other lodging.  After the trip, we will consider traveling together when and if you can be consistently civil and respectful to us.\"  And be sure to notify VRBO that you and your husband are the ONLY contacts, only people who can alter the reservation, only people to get keys, etc.  God forbid MIL manipulates anyone or impersonates you online to get in there first.  Going forward, you and your husband might benefit from some joint counselling to help him set boundaries with MIL.  He's likely experienced a lifetime of everyone tolerating and excusing her manipulative, awful behavior and doesn't feel right about standing up to her.",

      "scenario_description": "Over the Fourth of July, my wife and I visited my stepmom at her boyfriend’s lake house with our two daughters (7 & 6). The girls had been staying with them the week prior. On Saturday, my daughter and another girl asked to leave the lake early to play in the hot tub. My stepmom said no, and my daughter got upset and cried.\n\nThe other girl then asked her, “What do you even like about her?” and my daughter said, “She has a new house and money.” Not the most thoughtful thing to say, but she’s seven, and the lake house had just undergone a big renovation.\n\nThe other girl ran and told my stepmom what was said. My stepmom had been drinking all day and clearly took it personally. Later, I saw her walk up to my daughter (sitting quietly on the couch), get in her face, and say, “You make me so sad.”\n\nI immediately stepped in, told her to stop, and sent my daughter out of the room. I told my stepmom not to talk to my kid like that, and we started arguing. I asked if we could speak privately—there were  a dozen people in the room 10 feet away—but she refused and kept saying my daughter was “spoiled and entitled,” and that it was clear how we really felt about her.\n\nI told my wife we were leaving and went to pack. We had planned to stay until Sunday, but I didn’t feel comfortable anymore. My wife supported me, even though I could tell she wasn’t fully on board.\n\nWhile packing, my stepmom came upstairs still being defensive. We got into a shouting match. I told her I didn’t care about her money and never wanted a dime from her. She kept bringing up how “entitled” my daughter was. She walked out, and I continued packing.\n\nAs I was loading the car, her boyfriend came out and told me he didn’t think we should come back. He said she was “heartbroken,” but I let him know I appreciated his hospitality. He hadn’t been involved in the conflict at all.\n\nBefore leaving, I asked my stepmom if she wanted to say goodbye to her granddaughters. She wouldn’t speak or look at me. Later, she came outside and said goodbye to the girls. I told her I loved her, and she snapped, “You have a hell of a way of showing it. I doubt it.”\n\nThat started another argument. Her boyfriend confirmed he had said we shouldn’t come back. When she asked if he was going to say goodbye to the girls (he’s been in their lives since they were toddlers), he hesitated, then stuck his head in the car for a quick goodbye. She’d never act that way with his grandkids.\n\nWe argued once more, and she ended up calling my daughter a brat. That was it. I said we were done and left without saying goodbye to anyone else in the house.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nMy 7-year-old made an offhand comment about my stepmom having money. Another kid repeated it. My stepmom, who had been drinking, confronted my daughter, called her a brat, and I decided to cut our trip short. I know this is just my side of things, but I’m still struggling with how it all went down.",

Was grandma drunk and mean earlier in the week and your kid has had enough (fair)?  Or did she cry just bc she wasn't getting her way (not ok).\n\n3  Where did your little girl hear that \"we like grandma bc she has money\"?  I'm not exactly blaming you, she may have heard it from others.  It is your responsibility to teach her we like and love people regardless of their monetary wealth.\n\nOnce you know what your daughter experienced during the entire week and what she is thinking, you'll have enough context to decide what to do.  Maybe your daughter was wrong and deserves some correction, she certainly needs to learn that we like people regardless of money, maybe less drunk mean grandma time is needed, maybe you and daughter both owe step mom apologies..",

      "scenario_description": "I (24M) have an identical twin. We're not close, but I thought we had basic mutual respect. That belief was tested.\n\nI grew up in a traditional Southern town & only began coming out in college, about five years ago. It's been slow, especially with family. But since moving to DC in '23 for school/work, I've felt more comfortable living authentically.\n\nAfter moving, I met my boyfriend (26M), & we've been together 2yrs. Over time, I've introduced him to friends and family when I felt safe.\n\nCut to Nov. '24: I was home for the holidays & told my twin & his fianceé about my bf. They seemed happy for me. While staying with them, wedding details arose, & they asked if I'd be bringing a date. I said yes, my bf. My twin had gone to bed, but his fianceé said, \"While there are pros and cons, it's up to you if you want to bring him.\" That felt like a green light. My twin constantly deferred to her on decisions, so I didn't think I needed to double-check.\n\n5 months passed, my bf & I had spent $1,300 on travel (flights, hotel, etc.). 3 weeks before the wedding, I mentioned on a call with my brother that we were all set. His tone shifted: \"Oh, is BF actually coming?\"\n\nI reminded him of the convo with his fianceé. He said she never gave me permission & accused me of making it up. Then said, \"We can't allow your bf to come. We worry how Dad's side will react.\"\n\nI offered to call Dad on the spot. He dodged, saying he'd check with his fianceé (despite just saying it was his decision.) An hour later, no change. I was still invited-ALONE, still expected to buy a groomsman-match suiting (even though I wasn't in the party), & show up smiling.\n\nThat's when I snapped. I asked, \"If I didn't invite your fianceé to my wedding, would you still come?\" He couldn't answer & ended the call after some harsh words. \n\nTrying to make things right, I came out to my dad (which I feared for years) to explain the situation. He was surprisingly indifferent & even said uninviting my bf was extreme. He offered to talk to extended family. I thought I was removing the main obstacle. \n\nWeeks later, my twin called again. He now claimed our friends would be \"weirded out\" (So the excuse shifted) I said, \"If my bf's not invited, I'm not coming.\" He didn't budge.\n\nHere's the kicker: days later, my dad told me the fianceé admitted she did give me permission but changed her mind when she remembered \"who would be there.\" She denied this to my twin. Also, one of her bridesmaids is openly gay and brought her gf, but, according to the fianceé, \"she's not part of the family,\" so it's different.\n\nSo I didn't go. I'm still wondering if I made the wrong call. My absence was noticed. I got texts asking where I was. My mom had to explain it repeatedly. So instead of avoiding attention, my absence became the story. My relationship with my twin is dead, & some family ties now feel fragile.\n\nPart of me wonders, should I have sucked it up & gone solo, just to preserve bonds that shaped my early life?\n\nSo, AITA for skipping the wedding?",

However, if you wanted to attend your twin's wedding with your boyfriend, you needed to come out to your parents and extended family months before the wedding.  I don't blame the bride and groom for not wanting you to turn their wedding into your coming out party.  That's no different than the attention hogs who get engaged or announce their pregnancy at someone else's wedding.  Still, the bride and groom should have discussed that with you months ago and let you decide how to proceed.\n\nBrother and SIL were wrong to let you believe you could attend as a couple when they knew they wouldn't let your bf attend.  With the endless list of excuses, it's impossible to know the real reason.  I'm not sure if they're homophobic, or if they just didn't want you coming out to the family at their wedding.  I do notice all the excuses focus on other people's reactions, which supports the \"coming out party\" theory.  Ironically, you didn't attend and the wedding was still your coming out party.  They should have been honest with you from the start, honesty from both of you would have prevented a lot of drama and pain.\n\nI'm glad your parents took the news well, that must be a relief.  I hope in time you and your brother can mend fences.",

      "scenario_description": "My ex gf (33F) and I (31F) first met in a whirlwind romance in May of 2023. A few months into dating she fell on hard times and I offered to let her stay with me for a few months while she got on her feet. I am an extremely independent person and love living on my own and having my own space is very important to me but I really cared for her and wanted to help at the time especially with the expectation that it would only be a few months. However, a few months has now turned into 2 and a half years and we technically broke up almost a year ago. Throughout her time here she’s had several jobs however, the positions were seasonal and/or didn’t align with her morally so she quit. When she first arrived I was of course not charging her rent as I was genuinely trying to help her get on her feet. However, after living with me rent free for almost a year I realized she probably wouldn’t have the means to move out on her own anytime soon so we began to go half on rent and expenses. However, it only lasted maybe 5 months until we officially called it quits and she couldn’t afford to pay her half and save up to move out because she’s only been able to hold down a part time position for some time now. So she is still struggling. I feel bad she is in this position still but my lease for this apartment is up in October and I planned to end it and start my solo journey as I am ready to move on with my life and start anew. However, I am conflicted with what I know I deserve and desire (which is separate lives) and doing “what’s right.” My ex has expressed that her financial instability makes her feel scared for her future, she fears she will end up homeless if I stop carrying the load for her as she doesn’t have any friends and she’s not close with her family. She feels like because we are not toxic, have healthy communication and get along for the most part that she doesn’t see why I can’t just continue to help her out until she is stable enough to do so on her own. She often gets emotional and upset about the reality of having to figure out her living situation in the next few months and reminds me that if it were her in my shoes she would continue to help her ex for as long as they needed. I can fully understand her fear but it’s been almost 2 and a half years of me supporting her and I really need to know if AITA for no longer wanting to house my now ex partner of almost a year? ",

In the meantime, please don't get drunk near her and possibly wind up with a not so oopsie baby.",
