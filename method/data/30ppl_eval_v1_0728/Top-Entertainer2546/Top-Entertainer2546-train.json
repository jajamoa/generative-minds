      "scenario_description": "Would I be the asshole for uninviting my friend from my wedding? My friend and I have known each other for about a year and we got instantly close when we met and we hang out a lot and really skipped past all the small talk and we talk about the deepest things with each other. She is a compassionate and very positive person, too. However, I am an expat and a lot of her friends are local so because of the language I don't hang out with them as a group, but she and I do separately, so I don't know her other friends that well. Her fiancé and my fiancé also know each other from work. My fiancé and I have our wedding this month and they have their wedding in a year. They are invited to our wedding and we to theirs. She spent a long time looking for a dress for my theme for my wedding and even showed me photos and went to a lot of trouble getting the dress and was so happy and made sure it fit my theme. She asks me how the planning is going all the time and shares their plan for that weekend to attend as well.\n\nYesterday her fiancé asked my fiancé for lunch. Turns out, her best friend has planned a bachelorette party for her the same weekend as our wedding (they are doing their civil wedding this year so this is why it's earlier) and it's a surprise so he was basically informing us that he will come but she will not be coming. Of course, she does not know, but since we hang out, her fiancé asked my fiancé not to tell me until I have no more hangouts with her before the wedding so as not to make it awkward! He asked my soon-to-be husband to lie to me, which I think is very strange and rude.\n\nMy fiancé was so mad at this and of course, told me straightaway. He asked her fiancé why he would say to her friends this weekend was available and it turns out \"this weekend was the best fit out of all options\" whatever that means. I think he messed up the planning for the weekends and is now using us to get out of the mess he made, but how will she feel when she is told all of this the night before, and how am I supposed to act with her when we hang out when I know this whole thing. I won't lie to her that I have no idea and talk about how excited we are for the wedding day.\n\nMy fiancé will call him this evening and uninvite both of them and tell him he has told me they are not coming, but not the reason, as he doesn't want us to get involved in these lies for her fiancé to get out of a situation. Since this is not a random plan, this is a wedding, he can't lie to me for weeks about this. When I see her and she mentions the wedding I will just say that I am sad that they both can't make it and then her fiancé can figure out a different lie to get out of this. Am I the asshole for uninvited them both in this situation?\n\n  \nClarification: I would not be uninviting both of them since she will already have her party so is not coming, just going to tell her fiancé he should not bother coming if its not both of them. That\\`s all. I see a lot of comments saying its wrong to uninvite her, I will not do that. But he is the plus one in a way, so kind of weird he is coming without her. Also, no I am not mad that I am not invited I understand why and zero issues with it. I am mad at him. ",

But please don't un invite her from your wedding, don't punish her for her fiance's stupidity.  If you uninvite them now, her fiance never has to admit to what he did, you end up looking like the bad guys.  Talk to her afterward and tell her how  hurtful this was, while telling her you completely understand none of this is her fault.  Ask her if she knows how or why he made this mess.  Morning of the wedding, when she is off on her trip, its OK for your fiance to tell him not to come because you are both really hurt by his actions.",

      "scenario_description": "I (28M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for 2 years. We live in a big city and our relationship is serious—we’re planning a future together.\n\nMy mom (58F) lives in another state but was visiting. We’ve always had a complicated dynamic. She can be loving but very controlling, and we clash over respect and boundaries.\n\nA while ago, I made the mistake of venting to my parents about a fight with my girlfriend. It wasn’t anything extreme—just normal relationship tension about communication. I said my girlfriend can overthink or get reactive when feeling insecure. I realize now I shouldn’t have shared that.\n\nMy dad heard it and has been supportive and respectful since. My mom, however, latched onto it as proof my girlfriend is bad for me.\n\nDuring this visit, she refused to use my girlfriend’s name and made passive-aggressive remarks. She also complained that my girlfriend took a small mirror and told me to “tell your girlfriend to put it back,” which really pissed me off. I found it petty and disrespectful.\n\nWe had a tense breakfast conversation where she wouldn’t drop the topic. I didn’t yell but firmly told her to stop. I said I’d leave if she kept it up and eventually told her I’d pay and she could go. She was so offended she moved to a hotel and sent me an emotional message saying she’s done with me and mocking the idea I’d try to set “terms” for dinner.\n\nHer message said I “always” disrespect her, that I put my girlfriend over her, and that she’s tired of it. She accused me of being ungrateful and treating her badly all my life.\n\nFor context, my mom has also routinely overshared her marital problems with me (like details about fights with my dad I didn’t want to hear). I’ve listened without judging, and I mentioned this in my message.\n\nI texted her saying:\n\n-I won’t tolerate her insulting or refusing to name my girlfriend.\n\n-I know I shouldn’t have involved them in our couple’s issues.\n\n-I won’t let anyone tell me who I can or can’t be with.\n-I love her, but this is non-negotiable.\n\n-I want us to keep couple conflicts private so we can have a healthy relationship.\n\n-I’m here if she wants to talk or have dinner, but without that topic.\n\nShe replied with “ITS OVER!!” and says she’s done with me.\n\nI genuinely love my mom, but I also love my girlfriend. I’m not choosing one over the other—I just want respect. I don’t expect my mom to love my girlfriend, but I do expect her to be polite and not drag me into insulting her.\n\nAITA for standing my ground and telling my mom she can’t insult my girlfriend or try to control who I see?",

Nothing is ever good enough. Or nothing is ever as good as his stuff. \n\nI decided to have a small cookout at my house. He has made comments about its location and quality many times before. Nonetheless, we’re planning to have good food, drinks, and a whole lot of other stuff to spend some time with our friends and relax a little, and they’re both invited. My bestie is worried about her boyfriend’s cat allergies. I have two cats. Both hide when people are over. She asked me to lock them in the room for the day to not upset his allergies. He has been to my house twice now and has never complained about my cats. \n\nI simply told her no. After she persisted, I reminded her he’s been around them, and their fur, which lingers around at all times in the past. I asked what he did then to manage it. She said take Benadryl. I recommend he take it again before/after his visit. She persisted. So I said I’m not locking my cats in a room for the day. And so far that’s been that. \n\nAITA? I’m not sure if my dislike of her boyfriend is clouding my judgement. But I also think of how panicked and uncomfortable my cats will be, and it seems unreasonable to request that from me. Also, their discomfort really doesn’t seem worth his company. I don’t know… AITA??",

You know your friend has accepted how \"special\" her boyfriend is and caters to his demands.  He is likely making her make this demand bc he wins either way.  If you lock up the cats, he gets the satisfaction of making you cater to his whims while he disrespects your hospitality.  If you refuse, he convinces her not to go without him because you won't cater to his allergy.  Maybe the best answer is \"Honestly, I kinda assumed he wouldn't come because anytime he is here he complains about everything.

Why do you need help with something?”\n\nAt 9:00pm he texts me and finally asks me “I was gonna ask if you can take me to the airport 🤣”\n\nAfter the last text I sent him I stopped looking at my messages and I went to sleep at 10:30pm.\n\nI wake up and see that he sent me a text at 12:30am saying “Just so you know, you hoe for that 😒…. That’s $40 out my pocket”\n\nAm I really the asshole for not taking him to the airport? Sure I could’ve been more attentive to my phone last night but at the same time he could’ve been more direct with me and asked me in the first or second message instead of dragging it along all day. He also could’ve asked me a day or two prior.\n\nEdit: Looks like I’ve gotten about 0% YTA, 95% NTA, and 5% ESH.\n\nEdit: The day after he said that he was trolling(I don’t believe) and that he asked me too late.

      "scenario_description": "(Changed small details for anonymity)\n\nI (18F) have a mom who has untreated BPD. My mom has been having a lot of financial struggles when it comes to our house. She doesn’t manage money well and constantly is in debt, even when a relative had already lent her 40k+. Recently we had a meeting where she pointed out that my three older siblings (20s) and I both don’t care if she struggles or not. She talked about a time when she said the lights would go out if she didn’t pay them by a certain time, and none of us offered to help or figure out what to do. We ignored her in the gc when she told us, basically. My siblings pay money to her every month, are actively trying to save up to leave + care for our cats which are hers legally but she doesn’t care/pay for them. I didn’t have a job then, so I couldn’t help out and honestly, I didn’t want to.\n\nI want to put it shortly because if I explained everything she’s done, it would get too long: My mom is not a good mom or person. Growing up, my older siblings had it way worse than me. After hearing their experiences, and dealing with how she treated/treats me, I have stopped respecting her. She makes it very hard to want to do nice things for her. I feel awful because a daughter shouldn’t feel this way about a parent but the way she has been treating me, as well as my siblings, has made me resent her and hold grudges. Everytime she talks to me, I feel tense because she usually speaks to me to yell, criticize, be condescending, or make issues in general.\n\nI’m not the best daughter by any means, I can be lazy but my uncle told me I’m like this because the environment I’m in makes me this negative and unwilling to do anything at all for her. When it comes to chores, I don’t have a lot but the delivery from her is usually aggressive, condescending, and hurtful. I hate doing anything for her. If it’s anyone else in my life, I’ll do it in a heartbeat with no complaints, but with her, I get so upset and irritated. I should want to make her life more easy, but I don’t.

I'm sure you understand this is the reason for a lot of her difficult behavior, and her poor money management too.  Of course you are frustrated and exhausted dealing with this.  The truth is, your mom doesn't need financial assistance, she needs mental health treatment.  Financial assistance simply enables her to avoid facing the truth, she needs mental health care.  You are NTA for the way you feel.  Do your best to be a responsible household member, doing chores, etc.  You can also try talking to mom about the way she speaks to you and treats you, ask her to be more kind, but with her mental illness I don't know if it will be productive.\n\nFocus on taking care of your own spirit and financial health.  You are 18 now, if mom helped you open a bank account, go back to the bank, open an account all by yourself, and move your money into the new account and then close the old account.  If your mom helped you open the old account, she has access to it and can help herself to your money.\n\nFocus on your own future independent of mom.  Can you and some of your siblings get an apartment together?  Or can you live with your uncle?  I think a few months out of mom's home will change your outlook for the better.  Sadly, the best thing you can do for mom is probably to become independent, move out, and tell her that you love her and really want her to get the mental health care that she clearly needs.",

      "scenario_description": "This happened 2 weeks ago. I am 32 and my spouse is 29. My spouse and their family (parents, sister, her kids) were hanging out. I was doing some chalk art with the kids while my spouse caught up with everyone. We had a very light lunch and some snacks for everyone to graze while hanging out.\n\nThe time for dinner started to approach and my sister in law brought up heading down for dinner. I said that it was only 5:15 and we should wait until 6:00. She said she would like to go now. I said we should just wait and go at 6 because I had a coupon and there would be deals to make the meal much cheaper. The difference being from estimated $175 to under $75. We had already offered to pay for dinner before they arrived.\n\nMy sister in law grumbled about it and went to check on the kids and their chalk stuff. I didn’t think 45 minutes would be such a big deal. But a few minutes later the kids, who were fine a few minutes ago, came to the patio and were dramatically clutching their stomachs and saying “I’m soooooo hungry”\n\nThis annoyed me. I don’t like it when people use their kids to emotionally manipulate others. I think it’s pathetic. My MIL and FIL were easily swayed and said “Oh, well, let’s just get ready and head down anyway, it’ll be fine.”\n\nI looked at my spouse and they said we could just wait, but their sister said no, and started to get the kids ready to go out. I was super annoyed at this and while the kids ran inside, I turned to her and said “Using your children to emotionally manipulate people into getting your way is pathetic.”\n\nShe said “everyone is hungry, just get over it, if you couldn’t afford to pay for dinner then you shouldn’t have offered.” I do get she has a point that we offered, but is asking for just 45 minutes seriously that big of a deal to have her try to use her kids like that? I would think most family would want to help each other save a little money. Am i wrong?\n\n**Hi everyone I am editing this now since I think I got a lot of good responses. It seems that I just didn't know that by having people over at our house if was an official event that required hosting, and children don't eat sandwiches anymore so I need to get catering or something if I do it again (boy you guys did not think this was as funny as I did)**\n\n**Idk I'm learning a lot about different families and stuff like sandwiches aren't real food.**",

A light lunch isn't going to keep them satisfied until you arrive at a restaurant at 6 pm, order and wait for food.  A nourishing snack at least was required.  And little ones may need to go to bed before adults are done with a relaxing meal out.  I'll give you 2 a pass this time because you are young and don't have kids yet.\n\nBut SIL handled it poorly too.  She could have brought snacks, suggested it was snack time at 3 and offered to go out for ice cream, etc.  In short, since you were a little clueless about your guests' needs, SIL should have spoken up kindly before it became a problem.  And she should have graciously offered to help solve the problem, instead of making you the bad guys.  Bad grownups all around.",

      "scenario_description": "I 35F was scheduled to go on a camping trip with my older brother his 2 daughters age 12 and 14 and my younger sister in 12 days. My younger sister 30F booked the camping site and we all paid our share to her 101 each. My sister had decided not to bring her dog or invite my younger brother and his 3 young kids ages 2-6 because she did not want to spend her vacation babysitting,she wanted to drink and relax. My older brother and I agreed as we both work high stress jobs and just really need a break. That brings us to today my sister calls me and informs me that my 6 year old niece will be joining us and that we will be baby sitting her for the trip. I am now considering dropping out of the trip for a few reasons, one I feel blindsided that my sister offered to bring our niece along without consulting anyone first. Also I know she did not contact my older brother about this as she knows he would not be okay with taking her. I adore my niece but babysitting her is really taxing she has severe ADHD and is prone to screaming fits when ever she is told no. So I feel that if I go on this trip it will absolutely not be the relaxing trip I have been looking forward to for months.\nWould I be the asshole if I tell my sister I will not be joining them for this trip?\n\nupdate: first of all thank you for the comments. I did want to clear a couple of things up my younger sister does not have any kids and the 6 year old as he is bringing is our youngest brothers kid. Many have pointed out that screaming fits is not a symptom of ADHD and that is correct her ADHD causes her to be hyper and really high energy the temper tantrums are a separate issue. I have not spoken to my sister yet as today is a holiday and I did not want to ruin it for anyone, but today she informed my brother that my niece will not be allowed to bring her tablet as my sister has decided this is a no electronics trip. This is a recipe.for disaster as my niece does not do well on long rides and usually uses her tablet. The ride to the campsite is 3 hours and my sister is expecting my niece to sit quietly. This was a conversation that she made sure to have while my older brother was out of earshot so I will be letting him know what she is planning and will not be going on this trip. My plan is to spend that time at a resort and spa instead",

      "scenario_description": "I'm so upset and I do not know if I'm in the wrong. \n\nI'm 27 F. My father passed away of cancer back in 2018, when I was 20. \n\nLast weekend, my mother re-married. I get along well enough with her new husband, he's a cool guy in general, treats me and my mother well. He also has a 13 year old daughter from a previous relationship, as he's been married and divorced his ex. They have a 50/50 custody split of their daughter. \n\nDuring the wedding on Saturday, everyone had fun, I even shed some tears of joy for my mom. But Sunday, something shifted. My cousin asked if I am going to call my mom's new husband dad. I obviously said no. I already had a dad and was a fully grown woman by the time he came into my mother's life. \n\nAfter that comment, my mother and her sister pulled me aside, and started yelling at me to stop bringing up my father in front of her new husband because... he's jealous? Of a dead man? His ex is alive and they see each other every other weekend to pass the kid but he's jealous of a dead man? I basically told them to get off me. That I do not do it deliberately but my father had been my father for 20 years and naturally I bring him up sometimes in passing. Especially to my younger cousin who was only 7 when my dad passed away and barely remembers him.\n\nMy aunt went into a whole tangent how \"my dad was important to me but is not important to anybody else anymore and I should let go and move on instead of talking about him because everyone else is.\" That, in turn, made me cry and I didn't speak to either of them for the rest of the day.\n\nAITA for bringing up my dad sometimes? Is it reasonable of my mother's husband to be jealous of a literal corpse..?",

OK, you made a dad joke to mom's new husband a day or 2 before, no harm.  Maybe step dad felt weird about the joke?  The fact that you aunt was drunk says a lot I think.\n\nIt is also possible that mom's husband and/or his 13 yo daughter feel a little awkward about titles. What will his daughter call your mom?  Is she \"dad's wife\" or \"step mom\"?  It is quite normal for you to call him \"mom's husband\", most people who get a step parent in adulthood do so.  If his daughter wants to call your mom \"step mom\", or if he or your mom are pushing the 13 to call her \"step mom\" (I hope they don't), then maybe they think you should call him \"step dad\" to keep things equal and fair?\n\nI'm confused.  Talk to mom alone when things calm down, try to get some clarity.  You don't have to call him step dad, but if you have inadvertently done something else to cause some weird feelings, clear it up and apologize while assuring them both you are really happy about their marriage.",

      "scenario_description": "I (26 M) and my fiancée (28 F) are set to get married within the next year, while we were making our invitations we came across an issue, one of her friends we will call her Emily, has the worst boyfriend in the world. He’s insanely rude, a complete misogynist, and all around deadbeat. In the first year of our relationship Emily would call us all the time complaining about (we will call him Rick) saying that he would stalk her at every bar, and do a bunch of weird shit, and almost like an African wild dog (they hunt by wearing down their prey), eventually I guess he wore her out until they started dating??? ANYWAYS in that time I said A LOT of things about Rick before they went out together, which has even caused that Emily excludes me from all events involving my fiancées friend group, it’s never been confirmed but I’m sure it has to do with my well known hatred of Rick.\n\nAnyways things came to a head when making the invitations, I said that absolutely he’s not coming to our wedding, and that I didn’t care, which then prompted my fiancée to be panicking due to her friend groups dynamic. She told me that if this were to go through it would cause Emily to not come at all which would potentially cause even more drama with her friend group which would lead to potentially to a situation that would ruin the wedding.\n\nFor context, everyone hates Rick all her friends do but they don’t tell her that to Emily’s face, Rick was found to have compiled suggestive pictures of some of Emily’s friends in a file in his phone, people gave restraining orders against that man, he humiliates Emily publicly for amusement, and constantly argues with other people in that friend group. He makes women uncomfortable and my entire family is only women, and my 2 daughters.\n\nThe last thing I would want is for my fiancée to feel uneasy at her own wedding but I don’t feel comfortable having Rick around.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting Rick at my wedding?\n\n(Adding detail, her friends aren’t the ones with retraining orders, and yes the explicit pictures were nudes he had collected via a local Reddit thread he made to obtain them from their exes, also African wild dogs hunt by wearing down their prey I had not realized how it looked until someone pointed it out! My bad sincerely!)",

She can tell Emily \"We love you, but you know Rick makes us very uncomfortable.  So uncomfortable that you don't invite my fiance to events that include Rick, which we both understand and accept.  So please understand that we are excluding Rick from our wedding.   I understand if this is upsetting to you.  I still want you to be a bridesmaid, but if you'd rather not I understand.  And if you don't want to be a bridesmaid, you are still absolutely welcome as I guest.  I love you, we want to share the day with you.\"  There is no painless solution here, just do it now so the pain is a distant memory come your wedding day.\n\nYes, Rick is clearly a very bad guy, it's too bad Emily has fallen for him.  But don't let that creep into your wedding.  I hope Emily doesn't let Rick isolate her from her friends, but that will be up to her.",

      "scenario_description": "I (25F) am 35 weeks pregnant. From the beginning of this pregnancy (first one btw), my MIL has been DOWN MY NECK about my weight. Every time I see her, it’s like she can’t help herself but comment on my body. It started out as “Wow, you barely look pregnant”, but quickly spiraled once I DID start showing. I started showing fairly early, around 17 weeks (at least I’m told this is early for the first pregnancy). She immediately switched to “you really need to start watching your diet, don’t want to give my grandbaby diabetes!” Mind you, she says this with a… supportive tone? As if she’s looking out for me? \n\n—We had a pretty good relationship before I got pregnant, but it’s like now she just has the nerve to say anything and everything on her mind?? \n\nNow that I’m almost done cooking, I have gained quite a big of actual weight. Gave in to my cravings, which include a lot of sugar (of course.) I’ve gained about 40lbs, and it’s evident. My face is rounder, my arms and legs have definitely gotten bigger. I’m not exactly happy about it, but it’s not like I can actively try to LOSE weight at this point, I’m trying to give myself grace and remind myself that this isn’t forever, the weight can and will come off. \n\nNOW— MILs birthday party was yesterday. I told my husband in advance I wouldn’t be attending, because I REALLY don’t feel like being berated about my weight or appearance. He completely understood. She has also made fun of his weight his entire life, so he gets why I don’t want to be around that. I received a few texts this morning from MIL that I’m selfish for not coming to her party. My husband told me to ignore her and that he’d deal with her. But part of me *wants* to tell her why I didn’t come. I’ve never fought back against her when she says things about me. My husband usually always takes over. I want to tell her that I didn’t want to be the laughing stock of her 56th birthday party. Other part of me feels like it’s not worth it, it’d probably just give her more ammo. The kicker is that SIL has gotten involved saying I really hurt MIL. I haven’t responded to her either. I’m just… wtf? \n\nSo yeah, AITA for hurting MILs feelings by not showing up to her birthday party?\n\n",

I was shocked because I've never borrowed from her ever! So, it turns out that our aunt has taken her jewelry shopping and has asked her to pick out a necklace for me. She has jokingly asked the aunt if she was getting anything at all to which the aunt said \"No\". So, she chose an ugly necklace. Two weeks later, my aunt came to me and asked me to pick a necklace out for her which I thought would suit her. I picked a cute necklace with a small pink diamond pendant.\n\nAnd for Easter we gather in our grandparents house to celebrate the day. The aunt asked us to wrap the presents. We had already done so. Then when it was time for gift giving, she simply asked us to open the box we had wrapped by ourselves (which we thought was the other person's). Or if we wanted we could gift it to each other. I was so happy to get the cute necklace which I selected. But, my cousin wasn't. She simply demanded that I give her \"her rightful\" present (the cute necklace) and take the meh necklace. I refused and said that we were supposed to keep our own gifts because we spent time selecting it and aunt didn't wanna take risk and so she took us shopping and still made it a lovely surprise. And so, she's stuck with the ugly necklace and not me. But she argued and said that she doesn't find it ugly but wants to encourage gifting between \"family\". She wants me to be stuck with the ugly one and my other relatives who don't understand have sided with her. \n\n\nPlease help me. I'll quote your replies to my relatives. And if it's like above 50% supporting me, I'll have a solid point to hold onto. ",

      "scenario_description": "My soon to be ex-husband and I have owned a house together for six years. We both have had jobs that pay almost the same, I bring home a little bit more because he pays child support. So in the time that we have owned a home together all bills, mortgage, housework, etc. has been paid equally between us because we have the same bank account and bring in the same amount. We have one child together and I know you are all going to come at me for this but I'm not asking for any child support, it would help me a lot but I don't need it to survive. He is a deadbeat and I want him to have the ability to just leave our lives without anything holding him back. He agreed on 80/20 custody. \n\nI don't want the house, but he does which is fine. We had the house appraised as soon as we separated so we will know exactly how much equity we had in it when I moved out. We have been separated for five months so my name has still been on the house until we get this divorce finished. At first I was just going to have it to where if he ever sells it he has to give me X amount of equity, but my lawyer has advised to cut ties with the house and have him buy me out because with the economy right now there's no telling if it's going to crash and we lose all of that equity. If I did that it would mean he has to not only refinance the house but then add on the amount of my equity portion onto his new mortgage. He more than likely won't be able to make these mortgage payments if that happens and will end up having to sell it. So of course he is very mad about this and says that I am a horrible greedy person trying to ruin his life, and his family says that I am taking his kids' home away and why can't I just leave the money there. \n\nIf the equity amount was a couple thousand dollars I really wouldn't care and just say whatever keep it, but it's actually a very large amount of money, more than I make in a year. I feel like this is a very reasonable thing to ask for and is fairly normal on this type of situation. Do I feel bad that he might have to sell the house? Yes. But then I remember all of the shit he put me and his kids through and think karma is a bitch. So am I the asshole for expecting to get the money from our home that I helped pay for? ",

They said when they settle they would like to invite us round for dinner (hasn’t happened but kind to say.) We know their names and say hello in passing and I’ve even sent his CV/resume to my workplace when he was looking for work. So yesterday he knocks round and says could we discuss childcare options with each other as we as parents all work and may need extra help so we may need them to have our son occasionally and we could have their children round. We are both full time workers but incredibly organised so have all childcare booked and planned until October. I felt I wanted to be neighbourly and say yes of course BUT also hesitant as I dont want to be saddled with kids I barely know all the time and know for sure we simply dont need extra help. Should I have given it more time before I said “thats kind of you to consider us but we are genuinely ok! Thanks!” Feel like I may have dismissed him? AITA???",

It was basically, “I know what it’s like to grow up with parents who don’t give you unconditional love, but you’re an adult now, and you need to decide what type of person you’re going to be.”\n\nThe second time, she meant it as a compliment. A few months before my son was born, she said “I know you’re going to be a loving father, even though you didn’t get the love you needed growing up.” \n\nI have a complicated relationship with my father. He can be very obnoxious. Things have been tense between us for the past two years. It’s a very sensitive topic for me. I have difficulty talking about it even with close friends. If you were trying to hurt my feelings, it would be hard to find a better vulnerability to poke. \n\nI'm not good at thinking on my feet. I didn't know how to respond the first two times. If she says it again, I want to say “I know you're trying to be nice, but that's one of the most hurtful things anyone has ever said to me.”\n\nI realize that there’s a right way and a wrong way to address this, and my way is definitely somewhere in the middle. I'm just trying to find out which side of the asshole line it falls on. A well-adjusted adult would either have a heart-to-heart with Sally, about the lingering feelings from what she said, or just let it go and accept that she made a mistake. On the other end of the spectrum, some people would address this with yelling and name-calling.\n\nSally and I got along very well for several years before this happened. Now, I'm uneasy about sharing anything personal with her. I make chitchat with her, but I don't like to get into deep conversations, because I don't like the idea of her knowing about sensitive topics.\n\nI want her to feel ashamed of herself. I'm certainly being at least a little bit of an asshole by weaponizing her compassion against her. I just want to know if I'm going too far.\n",

      "scenario_description": "I'll be starting college this fall. I was invited to apply to a leadership program where I must live on a specific dorm floor with others in the program. With my past leadership experience and major, having this credential only makes sense. After talking to my dad about it, he said, \"Go for it (knowing I will have to live on campus - across our very large city).\n\nHe just gave me a list of things I'll be expected to do daily once school starts. With my dad working long hours I've always been the one to take care of anything to do with the house (and the 5 dogs my dad has taken in with no conversation with my sister and I). My sister is 14 and doesn't do anything. Homework during the year? no. Cleaning her room? no. Cleaning up after her friends? no. Taking care of the dog she begged for? no. She's never been given a chore list like this.\n\nI'm trying to graduate a year early from college (like I did in HS), and so that means I'm taking a full in person schedule and multiple online classes. I don't have time to come home early in the morning to take care of the dogs, go to my morning classes, use my lunch break to come back and take care of the dogs again, attend afternoon classes, go to work, take care of the dogs again, and then spend time on my online classes.\n\nI understand that I am a part of this family and therefore should have responsibilities, but giving me a list of things to do daily, when most of them only have to be done a few times a week, is insane to me. It would make sense if I had some responsibilities on the weekends and breaks from school, but every day is wild. Even if I had a list of things to do every weekend and my sister handles minor things during the week. Not to mention, the amount of extra gas I'll be paying for by going back and forth 3 times daily.\n\nSo WIBTA if I told him there's no way I'm doing all this while handling a job, an overloaded course load, and while trying to find a bit of a social life while my sister does nothing and all he does is come home from work at 12AM and ends up drunk?\n\n\nEdit:\nI'm a minor (obviously)\nMy dad isn't paying a cent for my education\n-I've grown up very independent\n-I know what it's like to be around older young adults (I was taking in person college classes at night as a 15 year old where I was a part of study groups of many different types of people)\n-I will have my own room in the suite (sharing a suite w 2 other girls - who I have already met with twice) + the dorm floor is also all other leadership students so they're held to a higher standard\n\n**Update**: I've ensured that my dad has no access to anything (finances, college information/access, etc.) In addition, I also spoke to my grandparents and they agreed to just ignore my dad over the situation if he tries to get them to take the money back I've been given. I've decided that while I'm still home, I'm not going to say anything, and then after starting classes, explain it's unreasonable and that my sister can step up. If he gets upset, it's straight low to no contact. (I'll be talking to the school's legal clinic, as a precautions, as soon as possible if it escalates.) If police come to remove me because I'm a minor, I'll tell them I've ran away from home but I have everything I need to be safe. My aunt, the leadership program director, hall director, and the counselor on campus have all agreed to vouch for me if needed. My grandparents don't want to step on my dad in any way, but they did say they are willing to financially support me if it comes down to that (probably won't, but just in case)",

      "scenario_description": "I (m37) have 3 daughter’s ages 15, 6, and 5. We’ll call my 15 year old  “Taylor”. I had Taylor with my College GF, we broke up when Taylor was just a baby (under a year old). We coparented well together. Now that Taylor is older, she comes here when she wants but primarily stays with her mom since she's closer to her school/ friends. I got married to my now wife 8 years ago, we now have 2 daughters together. Taylor’s always gotten along great with my wife and her little sisters. \n\nMe, my wife and all 3 girls went to Disney world for a few days. Taylor has always been a huge Belle fan. First day at Disney I had some work to do so I got up early and got ready and went to the lobby while the girls got ready. When I went back up to the room my youngest 2 were dressed in princess dresses and crowns. While my oldest had on a very what I would call belle themed outfit. When I saw the younger 2 I said you two look just like princesses. My youngest asked what about Taylor, Taylor in the last few years has been over the cute pet names. So I said I think Taylor is a little too old to be a princess but she's very pretty. Taylor said thanks but sounded a little off. I didnt think anything of it. \n\nWe had a good day, Taylor was distant with me but having fun with my wife and her sisters. I figured I would ask her when we got back to the hotel. Well I got a long angry text from my ex wife, saying Taylor had texted her that I called her sisters princesses but not her and said she was too old to be a princess and that really hurt her feelings I guess. I reminded my ex that Taylor has hated cute pet names for years now. My ex said considering we’re at Disney and Taylor was in a Belle themed outfit I should have thought that she might have wanted to be a princess for the day. My ex said I was being a oblivious AH, I tried talking to Taylor but she doesn't want to talk about it and hasnt talked to me much. My wife thinks I could have handled the situation better and made it up to Taylor. I don't think assuming my teen daughter wouldn't want to be called a princess is being an AH. ",

      "comment_text": "YTA gently.  I know you meant no harm and maybe you just don't quite get the whole \"Disney Princess\" thing.  Belle isn't a princess in the sense of being the daughter of royals, but every Disney heroine is considered to be a \"Princess\".  So in the Disney sense, Taylor was a princess too.  And if she dressed like a Disney princess, then yes dad, in that moment, she wanted you to call her a princess just like her little sisters.  Taylor needed to hear from you that she is just as special and loved by your as your 2 younger daughters from your 2nd marriage.\n\nTaylor was a little silly and created drama by complaining to her mom instead of telling you that her feelings were hurt., but you know your family dynamics better than Reddit.  And don't forgot Disney is super exciting for little kids, a teen has different interests than the littles, so Taylor may feel like this trip is more for her little sisters.  Some dad-teen time away from the little girls while at Disney will reassure Taylor that she's important too, and let her enjoy Disney in an age appropriate way.\n\nAll in all, you aren't a bad dad, just a little tone deaf in the moment.  Find a few hours for a special Dad-daughter Disney date, do something she wants to do there without the little girls.  Maybe the rides that are too much for the littles?  Maybe even a Belle meet up and photo op?  And apologize, be honest and just admit you had a dumb dad moment.",

Its a mobile home with expenses and bills being around 1,600 a month. My mother has stipulated that we must make it least 1k a month in order to stay here. I have already made 1k last month and this month. Meaning i have met this stipulation. My brother 20(M) however has not.\n He works 2 jobs making around 15-17 an hour at both. Yet he only works 20 hours a week (26 it most). I keep telling him to talk to someone or look for a new job because I cant cober so much forever. But he won't. He says \"I dont need to\" or \"just fucking drop it\". \n   My mother sat us down and had a talk with us about the money. She told me until my brother \"finds himself\" I have to be a good brother and pick up his slack. I said \"fuck no. Its not my fault hes a loser who sits on his ass all day\" (for context. I spend all may days off cooking and cleaning when he literally has no chores and refuses to clean). Now my brother is crying and im being called a bad brother when I refused to pick up his slack. Am I the asshole?\n \n\nEdit: I did want to clarify. This is the only time I have called him a loser. I am usually affirming and even helping him work on resumes and helping him get a job but he doesnt try and gets angry when I help or even try to get him to help around the house. He tells me im not a parent and it should shut up",

      "scenario_description": "A few days ago, my friend told me that on her 18th birthday, her parents told her she has five years to do whatever she wants, and then they’ll start looking for a groom and expect her to be married by 25.\n\nWhen she told me, I immediately said it’s her life and that her parents can’t just set a deadline for her freedom like that. I also pointed out that out of those five years, four would be spent in college, so she’d barely have time to “live freely” before being pressured into marriage right after graduation.\n\nShe said that as the eldest daughter (she has a brother and a sister), it’s normal and expected in her family. I’m Indian too, so I understand the cultural angle—but I still felt it wasn’t fair. We disagreed, and I was pretty blunt about it, which led to us not talking.\n\n**I might be the asshole because I was direct and didn’t sugarcoat anything, and maybe I hurt her feelings or sounded judgmental about her family situation. But I still stand by what I said.**",

However, especially in this situation, she doesn't need someone else telling her what to do either.  She needs someone to ask her what SHE wants.  By asking instead of lecturing, you are not only telling her to decide for herself, you are actually allowing her to decide for herself.\n\nSo apologize for telling her what to do, and start asking her what she wants.  And keep asking and listening and encouraging, don't lecture.  Five years is a lot of time for her to grow up and decide for herself.",

      "scenario_description": "So a coworker let’s call Rebecca, and I are legal interns in a law firm in the divorce department. I have been with the company for nearly 2 years, she joined about 6 months ago. I’m an undergrad student and she is a law school student entering her last year. When she first started, we often spoke and worked on projects together she would ask for my advice on the systems we used and assignments we were given. We also have another intern who started at the same time with me who we will call Alexandra.\n\nWhile Rebecca works all 5 days of the week now, Alexandra and I work part-time. On Wednesdays Alexandria and I share a desk and Rebecca uses her desk next ours.\n\nWhen Rebecca first began to work a new Hawaiian coffee shop opened up next to our work. Our other older colleague told us about it and one day we went for a coffee break. I let her order first thinking that she’ll pay and get hers. She ordered hers then turned to me. I ordered so then when the cashier goes for asking her to pay, she just stares at me and assumes I’m gonna pay. I thought that she might Venmo later so I paid and she never did. This same thing happened again two times. Later on whenever she would ask for us to get a coffee break I would always tell her sorry I already had coffee.\n\n2 months ago it was one of my bosses birthdays, and I messaged our group chat suggesting that we put some money together and get her a nice gift instead of us just buying smaller gifts I suggested buying like a cake nothing crazy she replied back saying no, I don’t have any money. However, a week later she wanted to take out another new intern for lunch while one week ago she didn’t have any money.\n\nThe last event happened 3 weeks ago where she was filling out something we call a case information statement, which is where you fill in a bunch of financial information. It is a lot of info and can be very complex I probably have done a 100 of them atp. Alexandra was there with us as it was a Wednesday and we were sharing our desk. So when she asked for help out loud Alexandra went over and tried to help her but didn’t know what to do. I was working on my computer and when I overheard what they were doing, I said oh no no you don’t have to do that that’s information for the other side we don’t fill out information for them. She paused said out loud in a rude tone “Greg you actually said that in a very rude tone”. I was flustered because I thought what I said wasn’t rude and I apologized.\n\nSince then she won’t even looked in my direction will turn her head when I try to talk to her and will leave at 2 PM when our day ends at 5 PM. When other people come and look for her, they ask me where she is. I have to say I have no idea. If I walk into the office in the morning and say “good morning Rebecca” in a snarky tone she’ll say “morning”. She’s become very close with the other female coworkers and our female boss. I feel a bit outed since I am a younger male. I feel like the job I once loved I hate now. ",

      "scenario_description": "my 18-year-old brother is extremely invested in learning how to become a broker. He is extremely intelligent and has been dedicating at least the last year of his life to studying and taking courses in relation to becoming a broker. He's had a little bit of success but nothing over 10 K in total and he doesn't quite understand the value of money yet so he thinks he's part of that 10% that can get ahead in The trading world without the capital. He has two older siblings. One being me, and my parents pushed me to do the exact opposite. It\nWas the army and trade school; moved out at 20 with no help and it has gotten me pretty far in 10 years. I make over six figures. I am a stay at home mom now, going back for a bachelor degree in my field. He emphasizes that we aren't rich and how he's going to break the chain.\n\nHe believes that we do not support him. He says that we are all wage slaves who will never succeed in life and goes on these very heated rants about why he's not going to waste his youth getting a blue-collar trade or working five days a week. He lives with our mother who does well but is feeling the weight to the bills. She wants to relocate out of state, but is holding on for him. Her job is not guaranteed and probably will soon be replaced or outsourced in the next five years.\nAm I the asshole because I told him he needs to be realistic and get something to fall back on? He is very disillusioned by the idea that working = poverty. He has no real idea or plan to support himself in the event that she no longer can financially support him . He thinks he's gonna get rich overnight.\nI get not wanting to be a wage slave and\nnot wanting to \"have a boss \". I don't blame his generation because of what they've seen in the last 5 years for not wanting to work for someone in the fear of being reliant on a paycheck, but he believes that he's gonna be able to perfect his craft for the next 10 years under our mother - verbatim. He has no real responsibilities or bills.\nMy mother is fine with him doing his trading in stocks, but she wants him to acquire his CDL, attempt to go to college for something that has foreseeable direct employment, etc. \n\nAITA for telling my 18 year-old brother, that trading stocks isn't a real job and that he needs to acquire a trade or make a livable wage? \n\nBackground : I am a master electrician which began in the military. I am also an LPN; currently staying at home with my young kids so I can finish my BSN. I don’t even necessarily need to become a registered nurse, because of the experience & licensure I carry. But I like to have options. I've worked very hard. I'm not downplaying my brother's dream just as someone who has multiple solid fallbacks I sense irrational thinking here. My other brother is a master mechanic who just chooses to not work. Our mother is an accountant who does private consulting, and has some knowledge about this sort of thing.",

      "scenario_description": "Some context: My best friend (also 29F) and I have known each other since we were five. We grew up inseparable. In high school, she became part of the popular crowd I was left behind. Around this time, I realized I was a lesbian and that I had a massive crush on her. It hurt watching her drift away and date guys, but I let her go and eventually found other friends. I even had a few relationships.\n\nThen for graduation she had this huge party and even invited me and my friends, things got weird. We were both drunk, dancing to  lana del rey we have always been huge Lana fans then we kissed. I tried not to read too much into it; she had a boyfriend at the time, and according to her socials, she kissed a lot of her female friends.\n\nLike a year after that she went through a mental health crisis and reached out to me. Her other friends had drifted away, and we reconnected. We became inseparable again, like nothing had changed. Eventually, she told me she was bisexual and had feelings for me. I’d loved her for years, but I tried not to pressure or project. Still, we ended up dating, moved in together, got a cat, the whole thing. I genuinely thought I was going to marry her.\n\nBut right before my 23rd birthday, she told me she didn’t think she was bisexual after all. That our relationship had started during a vulnerable time for her. We broke up, I moved out and we stopped talking.\n\nI was heartbroken.(still am tbh) I cried every night, stalked her socials, I haven’t had a serious relationship since.\n\nThen, three months ago, she messaged me. Said she missed being my friend and wanted to hang out. I was definitely still in love with her (I’m pathetic I know) but I said yes. We hung out until 5am that first night. She told me she’d been listening to Margaret by Lana Del Rey and fun fact, my name is Margaret! \n\nIt really was like no time had passed between us. She was engaged (which hurt), but I liked her fiancé. He seemed sweet and genuinely in love with her. Being back in her life helped me feel whole again. I started dating, feeling normal again for the first time in years. I stayed with her at her Airbnb the night before the wedding, we drank wine, listened to Lana, and she got a little handsy. I brushed it off as the wine talking. \n\nThen came the wedding. I wasn’t a bridesmaid, fair, since we’d only recently reconnected but I was honored to be invited. Everything was beautiful, until the first dance.\n\nShe chose Margaret by Lana Del Rey.\n\nYeah so she was dancing with her new husband, but staring at me, Lana was singing “when you know, you know.” And I just felt all of those feelings for her I’d been repressing come back and I felt so sick, it was like a bad fanfic. \n\nI left,  I cried so hard. \n\nShe texted and called, but I blocked her the next day. One of her bridesmaids messaged me saying I was cruel for walking out and ghosting her. I’m feeling extremely guilty. I didn’t want to ruin her wedding I just could not stay there.",

      "scenario_description": "One of the my jobs is writing short stories online. I've been really fortunate there and recently hit a spot financially where I could hire an editor. Because I do have a full time job besides writing, I felt like it was a good investment to make sure I had time to write without being worried about editing.\n\nI talked about this with one of my college friends and she volunteered to do it for me for a discounted price - about 20% below market rate from what I've seen online. She's trying to build an editing career and said the discount would be fine if I allowed her to use some of my work in her portfolio.\n\nThat was in January. I expected my followers to notice an increase in quality in my work, but it's hard to say if they actually did. I haven't received any comments about it nor have I gotten any new followers. That could be because I don't do well marketing though.\n\nThe problem is that she recently got some new clients which I initially thought was great. I took her out to celebrate her new contracts last week. I asked her if she was worried about taking on three new clients so close together and she said she wasn't since she could run her programs on one while she read through the other.\n\nLong story short, I found out she's been using AI to edit almost all of her projects, including mine. I am strictly anti-AI, especially in the writing space. I've talked about it pretty openly and it's all over my page and in my post history.\n\nI asked for a full refund for everything she's edited of mine using AI. I don't think I was very diplomatic about it (we were splitting a bottle of wine). I told her that I paid her to edit my work and she didn't. I pointed out that my followers would be upset if they found out my work was created using AI and that she'd harmed my business by not disclosing her methods.\n\nWe fought and left on bad terms. She texted me that night that she was an editor (during our argument, I told her she wasn't) and AI is a tool that she uses for a first pass, but she is the one who does the final pass. She said that she wouldn't refund any of my money because she was doing it at a loss anyway, but that I could consider our \"working relationship and friendship at an end.\"\n\nI don't think she was working at a loss - she's the one who offered to do it for below market rate, but it's not like I was paying her minimum wage. Plus, by using AI she completed the work faster than my estimate and therefore got paid *more* than she actually worked. But she made it sound like if she gave me a refund, she'd be like an artist working for exposure.\n\nI'm expecting this to hit our friend group soon (if it hasn't already) and I really want to hear if I'm the asshole or not for asking for a full refund before I hear it from them. \n\nSo AITA for asking my editor for a full refund after she completed the work?",

      "scenario_description": "I’m struggling to tell if i’m the asshole in this situation. For context: My brother (40M) and his wife (33F) have been asking me (19F) for years to live with them as we have always had a close relationship (Edit: my parents are old, adopted me in their 40s, so they kinda gave up on parenting with me. The only time i got to do things was with my brothers family, that’s why we have been close. I spent more time with them growing up than i did at home). They have two kids (8M and 10M) that I’m also super close with.\n\nI finally moved in September 2024 after I graduated high school that preceding June. I decided i was going to attend a community college near their house. Long story short I couldn’t afford to, so I took a gap year. I will now be attending a University near their house for free from grants and scholarships. \n\nTheir house is a 3bed2bath, so not a whole lot of space for 5 people. When I first moved in, I moved into one of the kids’ rooms, and they shared the other bedroom. This was fine, until I met my bf and began spending time with him. They got upset that i wasn’t home 24/7 (i would go to my boyfriends 2 days a week IF THAT) and said that I was essentially wasting the room and their son should have his room back; however I didn’t have the funds to get a place of my own since i moved 4 hours away from my parent house, where i used to live, NOR did they want me to move out. They decided to build me my own room in their garage; which mind you i didn’t ask for, but still thankful. \n\nThis is important; the entirety i’ve been there i’ve been super depressed. I felt i cannot have my own identity and they’re are always involving themselves in my life. They are sometime racist toward me and my BF (21M) as we are black and they are white. (Edit: to clear things up I was adopted into a white family). Regardless, i’m super unhappy in their house and it’s just not a healthy, or clean environment. They have 5 dogs and 2 cats, which they don’t clean up after, and they are all unhygienic in comparison to how I was raised. My brother is now requesting i pay him rent because I get to go to college for free, and he nor his wife got that opportunity and now they have to pay his wife’s student loans…not kidding that’s what he said.\n\nMy brother built the room about a month ago, and when I told him the news about me attending the University he said “You better not be moving out soon since we are building this.” Which i wasn’t planning to move out, but they are now not allowing me to see my boyfriend without conflicts between me and them. I feel like I can’t be an adult there. My therapist and psychiatrist both recommend i go out on my own, and i agree. I’ve tried for months to be happy here, and it just isn’t possible; I don’t want to put myself in a position where my education can be affected by my unhappy home-life. I applied to move into an apartment closer to campus in hopes of gaining my own freedom. However I’m scared they are going to hate me for it. \n\nAm i the asshole for prioritizing my mental health by moving out after they spent hundreds of dollars and hours of time to build me my own room in his garage?",

      "scenario_description": "I (25M) got into this dream Masters by my own effort on April, despite my health issues. The tuition for this program is actually very minimal, which is rare for a international Masters programs. I told everyone close to me, starting with my parents, elder brother, friends, close relatives(aunt & uncle) and some professors from my bachelors. My Dad (60M) was initially open to me going there but changed his decision soon after talking to my brother. He told he likely won't be able to sponsor my masters. So I applied to a scholarship and was following up on it. I also applied for an education loan. My elder brother (30M) was totally against it saying he didn't like it and even said \"Are you going to beg in that country after doing this degree?\". My mom and relatives on her side (Granny, Aunt, Uncle) were totally overjoyed & loved that I was able to get in this masters. My professors and other professionals in my field told it was a great opportunity and that it would benefit my career. I was working through all the administrative process and stuff by myself till today. My mom and relatives provided moral support during this time period and also tried to explain to my dad and brother that this is a good opportunity for me.\n\nYesterday my brother showed up unannounced to our home and made my mom stay in my granny's home stating that he & my dad wanted to talk to me alone. They told me I was in the wrong to inform my close relatives about this masters and demanded me to update on the process till now. I told them everything, including the education loan & scholarship I've applied. They started nit-picking the course details trying to find any fault in the program but everything was well-detailed & had no issue. Then they told me whatever I did was useless and I did nothing in these 2 months. They told I won't be getting the scholarship or the loan realistically nor do they have any money to spare for my studies.\n\nThey made it clear that they won't help in any process further but still want updates daily and need all the email I receive related to loan/scholarship/university forwarded to both of them. They instead want me to do a masters in this state next cycle / year. They told \"Stop living in a dream\" and accused me of being selfish for not thinking of the family or anyone else.\n\n**So AITA for not giving updates or not letting them interfere in the process after this incident?**\n\nFor context: I was lucky to have completed my bachelors with almost full scholarship with a few minor expenses covered by my dad. I had move back to my parents' place and the money I saved up after that was spent very recently on my medical expenses. I made it very clear that I wanted to do my masters in this field. The masters program I got into is not available anywhere nearby (not even nearby states).\n\nSide note: There’s also a separate and very serious situation happening at home that made me feel unsafe. I’ve made a separate post about that, so I won’t go into it here.",

      "scenario_description": "This seems ridiculous to me, but enough people are carrying on) about, I thought I'd better check.  I have ASD, so sometimes my reading is social cues is a bit off.\n\nMy children participate in a sport that takes place in a hall, and in the hall are these chairs that were clearly designed to be a uncomfortable as possible.  I suspect it's to discourage people from actually staying in the hall to watch things.  They're there to show the hall operators have made an effort to provide seating,  but cause random back spasms to any who dare sit for longer than three minutes.\n\nA few years ago, a kind family donated a lounge to the hall. It seats 3, and is lovely to sit on.  Just the right amount of squish in the cushions, which are kind of fluffy. It's a nice lounge. You can sit on it without contracting arthritis. \n\nFor the first year,  people jostled to get prime position on the lounge. Epic paper, scissors, rock battles were waged, with the victors sitting in comfort for 45 minutes, while people around them crumpled up,  twitched, or spasmed in the horrible chairs. \n\nEventually, families drifted away as children grew into new interests, and I was the sole survivor of the original lounge wars. So, most days,  I sat on the lounge. New families started, but none seemed to want to take advantage of the fluffy comfort on offer.  I was the lounge queen. \n\nOne day,  I arrived later than usual,  and THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE SITTING ON THE LOUNGE! I didn't recognise them, so I figured they must be a new family.  I said hello and introduced myself and my child,  then went and sat in the horrible chairs.  \n\nAs everyone left,  a small group of outraged parents approached me.\n\n\"Why did you let them sit there? You should have told them that's your seat! That's not ok! They stole your seat! They can't get away with this!\"\n\nI was confused.  I pointed out that there were plenty of other seats,  that it was a free lounge, anyone can sit there. I did not have exclusive rights to the lounge.\n\nIt turns out,  none of the other parents wanted to sit there because they thought I'd be upset or angry about it. They're upset with ME, because I never made it obvious that anyone could sit there.  Someone even complained to the coach! \n\nNow, it's become a Thing. Parents are arriving earlier and earlier to bags the lounge,  and give me smug looks when I arrive and they're sitting on it. I'm still not upset about it, but apparently that's not the right way to behave. I don't understand what's going on,  and the parent I asked about it scoffed and said \"as if you don't know.\" And implied I was doing \"it\" for attention. \n\nAm I the arsehole? Please tell me what's going on,  because this seems really stupid to me!",

      "scenario_description": "My sister is hanging out with me this summer for her summer internship and we have almost a 10 year age gap. Ever since I was in high school, my parents have wanted me to take her around even when I’m hanging out with friends and I felt like I had to babysit her. My friends were okay with it because they thought she was cute when she was 7-8, but I was always a little annoyed because I felt like I couldn’t be myself and have fun, and I had to always be monitoring my sister and make sure she had a good time and was safe. Fast forward until now, she’s doing a summer internship and it’s a closer commute to my place than my parents so I offered to let her stay for the summer. I invited her to have dinner with my friends (we’re all late 20s, early 30s) and I think she has a way of behaving that can be off putting, maybe because she’s much younger and still figuring things out. For instance, she’ll say attention grabbing things and if she’s ignored, she’ll keep repeating herself until someone responds. She’ll make comments about me, like how she can’t help with cleaning because I’m “too particular”. My friends brought these things up and don’t particularly want to hang with her much anymore because it feels like babysitting. \n\nI’ve told some other friends that my little sister is living with me for the summer as well, and they’ll ask “oh why don’t you invite her?”, and so I’ll feel guilty especially if she’s at home alone, but I think she still feels very much younger and won’t gel with us 30 year olds. My parents also have this mindset that I should include my sister in things and I almost feel like what’s mine should be hers.\n\nMy sister, to her credit, hasn’t brought anything up about wanting to hang out with my friends more, so I’m not sure if she cares. I feel like she is an introvert but when I invite her to things, she say yes right away, so I get the sense she does get lonely and appreciates the invites. We watch tv shows and go on walks together so I don’t feel like I’m ignoring her. She does have some friends in the city but they’re not always available and it seems like she’s still feeling out her internship group. \n\nMaybe a lot of this is self inflicted guilt and from my family/peers, but AITA for not inviting her out?",

They may have inadvertently harmed your sister too by making her too reliant on you for her social life.  Now that she's in college too, she's had a chance to start building her own life and identity independent of you and your parents.  Good for her!  \n\nLiving with you for the summer is a chance for both of you to slip back into the relationship pattern your parents forced on you.  It is also a chance to deliberately and thoughtfully change your relationship with each other.  Embrace this great opportunity!  Talk to your sister, explain you are trying to find the right balance between allowing her independence and making her feel loved and included in your life, and ask her how she's feeling about your relationship and her life this summer.  Move forward in new directions together.",

      "scenario_description": "It was our first date & we were walking near a river. Super cute super romantic anyway bc we’re next to the river it’s obviously windy & his fringe (which he had styled to look like a hair line) kept flipping up & revealing his real hairline below. So he keeps fixing it & holding down so often that he began commenting how annoying it is & I say ‘relatable’ & we laugh it off. But he kept commenting on it & opening up about thinking of going turkey to get a hair transplant so I say ‘tbh I personally don’t think u need to, ur handsome with a beard, u can deffo get away with going bald. Honestly, u’d probably look better bald’ literally verbatim that’s what I said. Wtf is wrong with that? When I tell u his whole vibe changed, started saying something like ‘no ur lying & no one finds men losing their hairlines in their 20s attractive. Females always encourage the things they don’t really go for like dad bods & shit. I didn’t expect u to be one of those’ so I’m in literal shock. Obviously I’ve paraphrased it but he was speaking & stuttering for a whole 2 mins. Anyway I sit there in silence for awhile just gathering my words bc I genuinely thought I said something positive & now idk what’s safe to say. After a min or 2 of silence he goes ‘should we go?’ I said ‘yh sure’ then he paid & we went our separate ways. No hug, just a smile, wave & get home safe. \n\nSo am I the asshole? Did I attempt to boost his confidence in the completely wrong way? I clearly knew he was insecure, should I have encouraged the transplant instead?\n\nEDIT: our date was a nice scenic walk and then we went to an Italian restaurant. For the ppl wondering what he was paying for, it was food",

      "scenario_description": "OK I have a lot of emotions concerning this issue, & I am kind of at the end of my rope, so I'm reaching out to the reddit community to ask: AITA\n\nMy stepmom (SM) and my dad have been together since I was 14. They have now been together for over 15  \nyears. While I have never had any glaring issues with my SM, we have never been particularly close. After my parents divorced, I stayed mainly with my mom who never remarried. My mother and I were extremely close. About two years ago my mom passed away and shortly after that, my SM began to introduce me as her daughter. I really bristled whenever she would do this because it felt like an erasure of my own mother. It also caused a lot of confusion for other people since my SM is quite young. They would often say things like \"My you must have had her early\" which in my opinion is just awkward for everyone involved. Eventually, I came out and told my SM that her calling me daughter was very painful for me and that I wanted her to stop. I also told her that I will never call her mother because I have an actual mother. Calling my SM mother felt like a racing my own history and the history of my mother.\n\nMy SM replied by telling me how painful the label of stepmother is to her. This is something I  \ndo not understand because she never had a SM. Her parents are still together.… so I just don't understand her perspective. She asked that I just call her by her first name when introducing her if I'm not going to call her mother, but that doesn't really work in practice. For example: \"Hi, this is \\[SM's name\\]\" \"Oh, how do you know each other?\". Then I explain, in a roundabout way, she is my SM...\n\nShe is also continued to call me daughter on another three occasions despite me telling her how painful this is for me. At this point, I don't know what to do. My dad is taking my SM's side and he has told me for years now that his relationship with her is more important than his relationship with me. The last time I tried to bring this up they both asked me why I was continuing to harp on the subject.\n\nNow I am a conflict turtle, so normally I would just let this be and avoid the situation. However, I recently became pregnant and reached out to my SM and sent her this message: \"You know I have a complicated relationship with calling you my mother but I want you to know you are this child's grandmother. I love you and am excited for us to be on this life journey together.\" Here is how she responded: \"We don't have a need for labels. We are excited to celebrate this child's life\". At this point, I'm really upset.\n\nUltimately, I am confused as to what direction to go and what to do. Sometimes I wonder: am I overreacting? Am I the asshole here? My stepmom and my dad make it seem as though I am. I am also open to any suggestions of what I can do going forward because I am at the end of my rope here. TY!",

Denise has been my step mom for 15 years, but ever since my mom died 2 years ago she has been introducing me as her daughter.  She knows it is kinda hurtful to me, but it makes her happy.

      "scenario_description": "My (21M) dad died. It’s just me and my brothers (19M, 19M) and distant relatives. We have more family friends than we do close family so we try to value the family we do have when we get to see them. His funeral was yesterday.\n\nOur cousin Khalie (24F) lived with us for much of her life because her mom struggled (being a single mom and in and out of difficult situations). I wouldn’t say my dad solely raised her but he played a big part in it, so they were close but since she turned 21 or so she’s moved out of state and hasn’t really come around much. Fine.\n\nShe volunteered to make slideshows for the funeral. Great. One was going to be right before the eulogy and the other was going to be right after.\n\nUntil yesterday she didn’t mention having any scheduling conflicts, but then sprung on us that she was picking up her mom from the airport in the morning and might be late. Fine, whatever. She’d maybe miss most of the viewing.\n\nBut then she starts calling during the viewing saying they had to eat and would be 60-90 minutes late and asked if we could request pushing things back, mind you, everything was already in motion. I said maybe the order of events could be changed but there was too much going on and didn’t get a chance to talk to the funeral home so things proceeded as normal.\n\nI stopped answering her texts which she assumed meant things got moved around. She eventually arrived towards the end, missed most of everything, got pissy with me after, saying I was selfish and talking to the funeral home could have been quick and easy and now she and her mom(?) feel robbed.\n\nNow she’s ranting on social media about her asshole family (me) denying her from being able to see her tributes. Mind you, her tributes are on her damn computer or CapCut or whatever she used to make them.\n\nI stupidly texted her briefly and said I wish it could have worked out but she just reiterated I am a selfish asshole. Am I?",

Your cousin made a series of choices that resulted in her being late.  That's on her.  I know a man who was very late to his brother's funeral because his wife was ill and he had to take her to the doctor.  He did not ask the widow to talk to the pastor and contact all the guests to push the funeral a few hours later, then re-schedule transporting her husband's remains to the crematorium.  Instead, the brother let the widow know he'd probably be late, took his wife to the doctor, and the widow let him give his eulogy at the end of the service and he led us in the final prayer.  Perfect.\n\nI am very sorry for your loss.  Your dad sound's like a great guy who truly loved being a dad to his own kids and any other kid who needed a dad too.  Men like him are a rare, and truly a blessing to everyone they touch in life.\n\nGrief is a tough monster.  I think your cousin felt torn between honoring the deceased \"dad\" who was always there for her, and the living mom she wishes would be there for her.  At a time she really needed parental support, she chose the only living parent she has left.  And instead of being there to support your cousin on a really hard day, her mom manipulated her into making the day all about mom's demands, causing your cousin to miss the funeral and her chance to speak to everyone of the extraordinary \"father's love\" your dad gave to her too.  She's probably mad at her mom and mad at herself for falling for mom's tricks.  I hope in time she is able to forgive herself and properly grieve your dad.  I hope she posts her slide show tribute online to share with everyone who loved your dad, and that they all thank her and share their love and memories with her too.",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for ruining my friend’s plan of proposing at a mutual friend’s wedding by telling my mutual friend about it and ruining the “surprise?”\n\nI (28F) had two close friends in high school. One of them is male (lets call him Ben), and he used to date my other friend (let's call her Kristi) who is a female. We all ended up getting into different colleges, and to be honest I did not keep up much with both of them the years following high school (the two of them ended up breaking up, so things were a bit awkward anyway) until a few months ago. My female friend suddenly reached out through Insta, and broke the news that she was getting married to her new partner of 3 years. I was happy for her, and was invited to the wedding. However, what I didn't expect was that Ben was also invited. At first, I thought it was a bit weird to me since they used to date, but I figured she just wanted to rekindle friendships and nostalgia.\n\nI reached out to Ben, glad that we could meet again. After a few convos, he told me how he still remained in contact with Kristi during college, and how they made up after the breakup resulting in a \"really strong friendship.\" Anyway, apparently he started dating one of Kristi's close friends in college, and thought it would be cute to propose to her during Kristi's wedding. This was because the wedding would take place in Hawaii at an extremely expensive venue, and he wanted to get one of the professional photographers at Kristi's wedding to take a photo of him proposing. To be honest, I was okay with this initially since prices are pretty high nowadays, and if they were really as close as he made it out to be, then who could object to a double proposal? But, he then he proceeded to tell me that Kristi would not be aware of it. This changed my entire perspective, so I told him to either tell her or propose somewhere else. He was annoyed at this, and tried to explain how \"Kristi would be happy for him\" and that I didn't \"understand the friendship dynamic between Kristi and him.\" He also insisted that he wanted his proposal to be a \"pleasant surprise\" for Kristi on her wedding date, and according to him, \"she'd be honored her close friend found love at her wedding, too.\"\n\nI told him that his idea seemed inappropriate, and that Kristi's wedding was her big moment that he shouldn’t take from. When he left me on delivered, I took action and told Kristi about his plan, and whether she would be okay with it. Now Kristi was actually elated about it and said that she was okay with it as long as it took place after the official wedding ceremony, he could propose during the wedding trip. This made me relieved, but now Ben is angry at me for \"ruining\" his plan to surprise Kristi. He’s been texting me nonstop about how I betrayed his trust, how I had “no right” to interfere, and that I embarrassed him by going behind his back. So, AITA for ruining the surprise for Kristi?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "\n28 yrs ago, my daughter’s father left us for our babysitter just a week after her 1st birthday. He had 2 kids with her, & left her for their babysitter as well. Moved across the USA and married her. Our daughter didn’t see or hear from him at all. No emails, calls, no child support. When she was 14 we discovered she was bipolar & put me thru hell, even with medication. Fast forward 28 years. Found out lots of things, including that he had people spying on me all those years & reporting back to him on what I was doing. “He was worried about the kids with me as a parent.” (For context - I raised 7 kids (this daughter Is child #4, mostly as a single parent, by my own choice. I never had a welfare check, went thru college 3 times for 3 different  degrees and never had the electric shut off, go to a shelter or was homeless.) he Never sent any messages, emails, phone calls, birthday card, anything. Now, I’m raising said daughter’s son, he is 9 and I have had him since he was 1 due to neglect and emotional abuse. He will soon be 10. She visits with him when it’s convenient for her, which isn’t often. Her boyfriends have always been twice her age and way more important to her than her son. One bf went to prison. We have full legal custody and have the right to tell her no any time we like, but for the boy’s benefit, we figured some contact is better than none. He is in counseling and his counselor has ripped her a new ass twice. He said “either be all in or be all out.” She just can’t seem to do either one. She also didn’t pay child support for 7 years, but the last 18 months they ordered her to pay $60 a month, which we discovered her father has been sending her to pay. She cant hold a job or a place to live. He gave her a BMW & drove it here. He’s given her thousands of dollars & paid her rent. He has said some vile stuff about me that has gotten back to me. I feel like both of them has really made a lot of my adult life a lot harder than it has had to be. While they’re off living it up & having fun, being all “lovey dovey family” while I’m over here exhausted and struggling. While I went on with my life and I have a wonderful man now….my daughter and her twice her age flavor of the week are talking about getting married. He hs had a vasectomy, doesnt ever want kids and has no desire to be in this boy’s life, let alone encourage her to do it. Good for her, if that’s what makes her happy. However, I have zero desire to attend that wedding, especially if her father is there and giving her away. Their relationship is not my business and I hope it’s a happy one, but I really have no desire to have all that rubbed in my face. It’s like neither one ever gave a shit how their behavior affected my heart, soul, or life. Would I be an asshole if I choose not to attend?  Because I feel like if I don’t, that’s just another reason for those 2 to bad mouth me and make me feel like a piece of shit parent bc I’m supposed to support her no matter what.",

      "scenario_description": "Long-time lurker, first-time poster!\n\nI (25F) am part of a close group of five women who’ve been friends for nearly 4 years. We’ve always supported each other—especially through relationship ups and downs. One of us, Nancy (26F), moved away two years ago, but we’ve kept in touch with video calls, messages, and trips every few months. She’s engaged, and we’re all going to be bridesmaids at her wedding next year.\n\nHere’s where things get rocky: her fiancé. I don’t hate him, but he’s always been distant and a bit cold. Over time, it’s started to feel like he just doesn’t like the group. Whenever we visit or she comes to town, they go off and do their own thing—even when plans were made specifically to spend time together.\n\nExamples:\n\n* During a bar crawl, Nancy asked my boyfriend what he loves about me. I asked her fiancé the same and he shut it down with, “Why are you asking that?” then ignored the convo.\n* On Halloween, we were all supposed to go out together. Nancy, her fiancé, and their other friends got ready early and left without us.\n* On a visit, he barely spoke to anyone except her.\n* Once, another friend tried asking him casual questions to get to know him. He gave short, disinterested replies.\n\nThe tipping point was my birthday weekend. I planned it around everyone’s availability so all five of us and our partners could join. On Friday, Nancy and her fiancé skipped mini golf with the group and did it alone beforehand. They showed up late to dinner, didn’t eat, and later ditched us mid-walk without a word. We found out the next day they went clubbing—at a place Jennifer had mentioned wanting to check out.\n\nSaturday was meant to be girls-only. Things went well until Nancy’s fiancé showed up at the bar and just sat beside her, barely interacting with anyone. On Sunday, we adjusted plans for weather and I asked for a group photo. While we were walking around, Nancy texted that they went for ice cream and a walk—alone again. They arrived late, left early, and later went to a comedy show and bar hopping without inviting us until hours later.\n\nWe’re not trying to say she can’t be with her fiancé—we get that he’s her person. But when she’s with us, we just wish she’d actually *be* with us. We don’t hate him. We’re happy she’s happy. But it’s hard not to feel like she treats us like an afterthought, especially when we all made the time and plans to be together.\n\nSo… WIBTA for wanting to tell her that we feel she hasn’t been a good friend lately and that when we plan group time, we want her to actually be present?",

She said her son has been jobless for a year and in this economy, I should help them out. 'That is what family is for!', she says.

      "scenario_description": "My (30s M) friend (30s M) and I planned a beach trip to Florida about two months ago. It's a 3.5-hour drive, and we booked an Airbnb together. The plan was for a relaxed \"boys trip\" getaway.\n\nAbout a month ago, he casually mentioned that his ex-girlfriend (who he broke up with about 3 months ago) would coincidentally be in the same beach town that weekend. We both joked about it, referencing \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" and imagining awkward waves if we even saw them. I definitely got the impression that we weren't planning on interacting with her.\n\nFast forward to this past Sunday (five days before the trip, which starts Friday night). He tells me he's now planning to go out to dinner with his ex-girlfriend and her family on Saturday night. This is a big deal because we're arriving Friday at 9:30 PM, so Saturday is our only full night on the trip.\n\nHe asked if I wanted to come along to this dinner. I was pretty taken aback. I told him I thought this was supposed to be a boys trip for us, and I wasn't cool with being essentially ditched for our main night there. I then said that if his priority was seeing his ex, then I didn't really want to go on the trip anymore.\n\nHe immediately got confrontational, accusing me of \"blowing up the trip\" and \"making a huge deal out of nothing.\"\n\nTo me, this feels like he's clearly choosing his ex-girlfriend over our planned time, especially since this trip was specifically for us to hang out. I considered us best friends.\n\nAITA for considering backing out of the trip because he wants to spend our only full night with his ex-girlfriend and her family?",

And if either of them still has some kinda feelings, they hookup where?  At your place?  So you get all the sound effects?  Cuz she's staying with her parents, so they can't go to her place.  And if it goes well, they're in no hurry to part ways on Sunday, leaving you as a very unwelcome 3rd wheel?  Umm, no, not fun, not relaxing.  You're just there to share expenses and fill his time until he can hookup with his ex.",
