      "post_title": "WIBTA if I didn’t give my brother money for rent?",
      "scenario_description": "I (18F) am starting university this fall. I have about $30,000 in savings/grants, meant to cover 4 years of undergrad + one year of grad school. That works out to roughly $6,000/year.\n\nI also qualified for financial aid and will be receiving around $18,000 for the school year. But it’s paid in installments, and tuition is automatically deducted, so in reality, I’ll have about $4,500/semester for living and school expenses. I’m also receiving a $2,500 bursary from my university.\n\nFor this upcoming fall semester, I’ll have around $10,000 to spend, assuming I only use some of my savings. First year will be expensive. I’m living in residence, and will need to pay for bedding, furnishings, and electronics for school. I’ve budgeted for it all and will likely have a little leftover, either to spend on extras or save for the next semester.\n\nNow, onto the issue: my brother (20M) also had post-secondary savings/grants, though I’m not sure how much. He started university (commuted), dropped out, went to college a year later, and dropped out again. During that time, he signed a lease for an apartment he couldn’t afford. He doesn’t have a job and hasn’t for years. When our mom told him the place was too expensive, he insisted he’d find work… he never did.\n\nNow, he owes $2,700 in rent and my mom expects me to cover it. And to be honest, I don’t believe I’ll see that money again. Her reasoning is that I’ll still have ~$24,000 left in my savings after this year. Technically true, but that money has to last the next 4 years and possibly a master’s program.\n\nWhat frustrates me is how little effort my brother puts into changing his situation. He says he dropped out to get tested for ADHD… okay, but he’s doing absolutely nothing in the meantime. He turned down a one day job last week that our older brother offered to drive him to. Even if it’s only for one day, it would give him some experience and at least some money to hold onto. When I suggested he go to therapy (which is covered by our mom’s insurance), he said he didn’t need it, just a diagnosis. Like… there are steps to this.\n\nAnd the wildest part? He talks all the time about going to Stanford or Caltech and working at NASA. I’m not trying to crush his dreams, but he has no track record of following through, and no plan that actually reflects what those goals would require. Even if ADHD is a factor, you still have to put in the work. Medication alone doesn’t fix everything.\n\nAt the end of the day, I can technically afford to help. I just don’t want to, because I don’t trust I’ll ever see that money again. And I don’t think it’s fair to take away from my education, something I’ve planned for and worked toward, because he refuses to help himself.\n\nAm I being unreasonable for saying no?",

      "comment_text": "NTA id consider telling your mom you can’t afford to pay your brothers bills as his late rent will continue since he’s made no effort to work or go to school for years or get counseling. So if she wants to subsidize his lifestyle at about $4k a month or more, she can. However , if you did, your college money will disappear faster than his did. I’d add that the money is supposed to go up school so it’s questionable legally whether you can dedicate grants and financial aid to a non school purpose even if you didn’t want to attend college. However, you do so no point in her having two kids drop out of college.",

      "scenario_description": "So my (f31) ex husband (m33) just broke up in March of this year. I won’t go into details about it but he sprung it on me quite suddenly. We just bought a house together a little over a year ago and we’ve both been living there in the meantime while I look for a new place to live and our lawyers figure out the financial details. I’m not particularly attached to the house so I don’t mind moving but it takes time. \n\nI currently have one 14 year old chihuahua mix who was my dog before I met my ex husband so I will be keeping the dog with me.  Ex loves dogs and spoke a lot about wanting to get another dog. He even showed me specific other dogs he had been considering just a few weeks before he dumped me. He now tells me the one of the reasons he wanted another dog so bad was that he could have a dog that was just his. \n\nHe recently sent me a message asking if it would be okay for him to get another dog soon, while I’m still in the house. I told him no because he works quite a bit and I don’t have a day job (I’m an artist) so I’d be the one at home all day taking care of this new dog. I also said it was unfair to my dog to make him socialize with a new dog all of a sudden, especially since we won’t be staying here. My dog is old and not super friendly to other dogs. \n\nI do feel a little bad that ex still helps with my dog but him and my dog have lived together for like 8 years so of course my dog still loves him and asks for attention from him. The dog doesn’t know what’s going on. It’s also not like he needs very much care. Ex just gives him food in the morning and lets him outside a few times and lets him snuggle with him. \n\nEx said that he didn’t expect this whole divorce/me moving out process to take so long and tried to make me feel guilty by saying a lot of the dogs he looks at are at shelters where they’ll be put down soon if they’re not adopted. \n\nAm I the asshole for just telling him to wait and not look at new dogs until I’m gone?",

      "scenario_description": "This was a family event with my(30M) long term gf's(30F) family - we've been dating for 13 years and living together for 7. Her family would describe her brother as extroverted, light hearted and well intentioned.\n\nThere were 12 people total at this event.\n\nMy girlfriend, let's call her G, has recently gotten a new car, from her job, and the insurance very specifically says only she is allowed to drive it, which makes G (and myself) anxious to let other people drive it, even me, who she would otherwise be more than happy to take the driver's seat since she's not comfortable driving.\n\nG's brother(32M), let's call him B, is the kind of person that enjoys having the attention of whatever group he's in, when we're hanging out and he shows up, the whole thing quickly turns into where is B going, what does B want to do, etc. This has not changed in the 13 years I've known this family.\n\nThere is a sibling bullying dynamic in that B messes with G any chance he gets, like they're 10 years old. The problem I have is that the parents don't do - and evidently never have done - anything about it, they just laugh and wave it off as typical sibling behaviour, further enabling it. A single fresh example: at this gathering, G arrived and complained to her father that, as she was driving there, B - in the front seat - kept messing with her, the car, pressing all the buttons and honking the horn. Their mother was in the car and obviously did nothing about it, and the father's response was something along the lines of \"you keep complaining about it you only give him more reason to do it\".\n\nSo right from the start of this gathering I was a bit miffed, once again, at this bullshit enabling that happens constantly.\n\nFast forward to after we ate, we were playing some board games, B comes over and asks for the car keys, G asks why does he need the keys, and their mother says \"he's just going to rest a little\" (we were at some picnic tables in a small park). G gives B the keys. A few minutes later we see B driving the car down the road. Everyone was just looking at it and smiling, like they always do \"haha, there he goes, what a goofball\". My line of thought is usually: this is infuriating but it's not my place to handle it, usually I mention it to G when we get home, in hopes she can have a conversation with her parents about it. Not this time, this time I lost it, I shouted at him to bring the car back, and started cussing in front of the kids, which G then started arguing with me about. Their father and I then start arguing about B, and I tell him (paraphrased) that B is an asshole and it's his responsibility as his parent and that he should be ashamed of B's behaviour. Naturally the father was upset, walked out of the game, and I walked out of the gathering.\n\nMy position on this family dynamic has been a pain point in me and G's relationship, and I wish I had the social skills to handle the whole thing a lot better, but tell me, AITA?\n\nEdit for posterity: I've had to clarify this a few times so clearly I didn't explain myself properly. When I argued with FIL, I didn't mean that he should be doing something about B taking the car, what I told him is that this is the result of poor parenting, and that this type of behaviour should have been dealt with long ago.",

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

I started to date 4 years after his death and remarried 7 years later (Sofia was 16 and Julie was 9). Sofia wanted nothing to do with him and looking back was a dick to him. My husband (Jim) never tried to force Sofia to see him as a father figure, but Julie did see him as a father figure. She refers to him as Dad. Both girls have been to therapy, Sofia hated it and I actaully think it made the issue below worse. Julie like it and helped her overcome never knowing bio dad.\n\nThat was the main issue between Sofia and Julie, Sofia thought julie was abandoning and replaying their bio-dad.  Julie made it very clear that Jim is her dad and basically bio-dad doesn’t mean much to her since, she doesn’t remember him. Many fights and their relationship was strained. Therapy didnt help, separate and group were tried. \n\nIt got better when Sofia went off to college and they had space. Julie (24) is getting married. She announced this during dinner last Saturday and asked for Jim to give her away. Sofia did not take that well and started telling Julie that she was a horrible daughter and that she is replacing dad.\n\nThe announcement was ruined and Julie told her not to come to the wedding. I pulled Sofia aside and told her that she needs to apologize to her sister for her outburst, that she is way too old for this and it is time for her to grow the fuck up. That is fine that she doesn’t see jim as her father but get over that her sister does. \n\nShe was crying when I finished, told me it is my fault for getting remarried in the first place and had not contacted me since. I know she apologized to Julie but she won’t respond to any of my texts.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSameish question being asked, her is one of my comments answering it\n\n\"No, he never forced himself to be a father figure. Bio dad stayed very alive in memory after my wedding, he wasnt hidden. He still got mentions and story all the time, he was celebrated on his birthday and so on\n\nNo grave visiting because he is cremated and is on the fireplace.\"",

I’d leave her be since she’s the one who needs to grow up in order to have reasonable relationships with her family. I feel badly for the rest of you.

      "scenario_description": "This is a throwaway account because people I know know my real acct. I need a perspective on this outside of my family to know if I'm not treating this event with enough importance.\n\nSo my sister had the first baby of our family and we're all so happy about it, but she's also treating her kid like he should be the center of our universe. Examples being constantly spamming our group texts with photos of him, turning EVERY conversation to be about him, etc.  \nThis attitude is supported by her husband's parents and both of my parents. My sister and her husband are having a big birthday party in 3 weeks for his first birthday and expecting us to be a there.\n\nI begrudgingly bought tickets to fly for the event a month ago. I'm gonna be honest: While I LOVE my nephew, I was already kindof dreading the party even though I'm willing to go through with it just to show support. There are a LOT of jerks amongst my sister's friends and her husbands family (these will be the majority of the 50ish guests present). I also find giant celebrations for a baby who will not remember it to be obnoxious. I would much rather just send a gift and celebrate my nephew in a visit one-on-one vs. spend $$$ on a plane ticket for an event where I socially suffer and I don't even really get to have real quality time with my nephew.\n\nAnother thing is that now an important work engagement is coming up for that same week. I'm considering canceling my plane ticket because I don't see how I can make it work without losing out on an important opportunity with my career.  \nMy parents shamed me pretty hard when I mentioned my feelings on it to them privately *(\\*\\*\\*EDIT: \"feelings on it\" meaning that I can't make it happen due to work, NOT my frustration about treating nephew like he's center of the universe)*, and they said I needed to still go to this because it's a big deal for him to turn 1 year old. Like I get that it's a big deal for the grandparents to be there, but me? I just don't really see why it's so important. Please help me see the other side of this - am I being unreasonable if I don't go?\n\nFAQ Notes based on comments I'm getting:\n\n1. I love my nephew and am not jealous of him lol. I am struggling with every conversation getting hijacked into more variations of the same sentiments about what he's doing every second of the day. I want to hear what other family members have going on too and it feels exhausting to get inundated with so many similar/same pics and comments all day every day.\n2. My parents shamed me because they said the baby would \"miss\" me being there. I have not told my parents or sister that I find the nephew oversharing obnoxious. I am keeping that to myself and only shared that here because it's an honest part to the dynamics and personal frustrations.\n3. the plane tickets are roughly $400 and does not include food, transportation and accommodation. It's definitely a financial sting but not totally threatening. I don't need to take off work as I can do remotely but I would be missing out on an in-person opportunity back home which is the bigger sting.\n4. I have met the baby 4 times now and will continue to make lots of efforts to see him if that matters.",

      "scenario_description": "As some background information, I (16, male) have an extremely large collection of stuffed animals, including Jellycats, Care Bears, and Build-A-Bears which I began collecting when I was around 11 or 12. I was bullied during my childhood for being autistic and spent a lot of time in hospitals which I feel like I had to act more mature than what I was to try and deal with it, so collecting these toys has helped me reconnect with my younger self. I will admit I do have a very big connection to them they all have names and personalities\n\nMy mom has been very supportive when it comes to my neurodivergence but my stepdad isn't, My relationship with my stepdad has always been strained. A month ago, he stopped taking his medication for depression, believing he didn’t need it. Since then, our interactions have deteriorated. We’ve been snapping at each other, and my attempts to set boundaries have been ignored; he sees them as an attack on him.\n\nThe main reason I came here is that yesterday I was running late for a taster day at the college I'm starting at, and I accidentally left my door open. I thought it would be fine since we have a gate at the top of the stairs to stop our dogs from coming up. When I got home, I realised that my only childhood stuffed animal I've kept, Charleston, wasn’t on my bed. I tried looking around, thinking maybe I had left it on the floor, but he wasn’t there.\n\nI went downstairs to ask my stepdad if he had seen Charleston, and he told me that the dogs had taken him off my bed. He let the dogs have him because he thought it was “just a stupid stuffed toy that I should have left behind in secondary school.” I feel like I might have overreacted because I shouted at him, telling him he had no right to throw my stuffed animal away like that. I know I shouldn’t have but I swore at him.\n\nIt escalated into a fight where he said that I need to start acting like an adult, get a job, and grow up. And that I'm a slob. He isn't entirely wrong; I've been putting off getting a job before starting college to see if I can handle it.  In the heat of the moment, I told him he was weighing down the family and that my life was better before he married my mom. I ended up going through the trash and found Charleston. He was completely fine, just a bit dirty, which was an easy fix. I haven't spoken to my stepdad since.\n\nMy mom thinks I’m being overdramatic since it’s just a stuffed animal, but to me, it means so much more than that. My stepdad has always hated Charleston, as if his very existence offends him. I’m wondering how the dogs got to Charleston if the gate was closed and why he didn’t have any marks on him. If my dog had gotten hold of him, there would only be shreds left. They both know how much Charleston means to me; he’s been there for me through every surgery and bad day at school. Plus,  the toy was discontinued, so if I hadn’t found him, I wouldn’t have been able to buy another. ATIA?\n\nEdit: hi guys and ty for the positive comments! I just wanna clarify for people asking more about why I haven’t gotten a job . I was only legally able to work for the last two months of secondary school and my main concern was sitting my GCSE’s . Me and my mom had agreed on me waiting before working . And my stepdad had agreed till recently we also wanted to focus on getting my health back to a good place before I started college ",

I had Taylor with my College GF, we broke up when Taylor was just a baby (under a year old). We coparented well together. Now that Taylor is older, she comes here when she wants but primarily stays with her mom since she's closer to her school/ friends. I got married to my now wife 8 years ago, we now have 2 daughters together. Taylor’s always gotten along great with my wife and her little sisters. \n\nMe, my wife and all 3 girls went to Disney world for a few days. Taylor has always been a huge Belle fan. First day at Disney I had some work to do so I got up early and got ready and went to the lobby while the girls got ready. When I went back up to the room my youngest 2 were dressed in princess dresses and crowns. While my oldest had on a very what I would call belle themed outfit. When I saw the younger 2 I said you two look just like princesses. My youngest asked what about Taylor, Taylor in the last few years has been over the cute pet names. So I said I think Taylor is a little too old to be a princess but she's very pretty. Taylor said thanks but sounded a little off. I didnt think anything of it. \n\nWe had a good day, Taylor was distant with me but having fun with my wife and her sisters. I figured I would ask her when we got back to the hotel. Well I got a long angry text from my ex wife, saying Taylor had texted her that I called her sisters princesses but not her and said she was too old to be a princess and that really hurt her feelings I guess. I reminded my ex that Taylor has hated cute pet names for years now. My ex said considering we’re at Disney and Taylor was in a Belle themed outfit I should have thought that she might have wanted to be a princess for the day. My ex said I was being a oblivious AH, I tried talking to Taylor but she doesn't want to talk about it and hasnt talked to me much. My wife thinks I could have handled the situation better and made it up to Taylor. I don't think assuming my teen daughter wouldn't want to be called a princess is being an AH. ",

      "scenario_description": "My sister does this thing where she'll just say something she wants with the expectation that someone will do it for her. For example, if she wants the AC turned on, instead of asking someone to turn it on for her, she'll keep repeating things like \"Oh, isn't it super warm in here?\", \"Does anyone else feel really hot?\" or \"I heard that today is a super hot day!\" and if someone asks her if she wants the AC on, she'll reply with \"No, no, I'm good! But if *you're* hot then you should turn it on!\"   \n  \nAnyways, last weekend it was my birthday so my family and I went out to celebrate. During the meal, she kept making comments implying that she wanted another cocktail, but wouldn't order it. The waitress even came by and asked if we needed anything, but she didn't order a drink even when we all did. I could tell she was agitated at that point, but it was my birthday so I just ignored her. \n\nWhen we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we \"let\" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying \"no\" to the waitress because her family should've \"taken care of her\" (her words, not mine). \n\nThe three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.

      "scenario_description": "I (19F) have a stepmom. let’s call her Sheila. She’s not mean, we get along fine, and honestly, she can be really nice. We’ve had good moments. But deep down, I still resent her. And not in the usual “evil stepmom” kind of way.\n\nBefore I was born, Sheila and my dad were together in their early 20s. I don’t know the full story, but it was abusive. Bad enough that Sheila literally ran away to Florida to escape him and cut contact completely.\n\nFast forward to when I was in 6th grade. I was with my grandma (who practically raised me), and we randomly ran into Sheila at a store. I didn’t know who she was, but she told my grandma that she had just seen my dad a few days earlier, and they’d exchanged numbers. She asked if she should reach out. My grandma told her not to since my dad was already dating someone else.\n\nWell, a few weeks later, I met Sheila for the first time, and shortly after, she was living with us. Eventually, we moved into her house about 30 minutes away from where I grew up. After that, whenever they fought (which was often), she’d kick us out. I got kicked out of the house with my dad twice, and one time she just kicked him out and let me stay, but it was super uncomfortable. Each time she kicked him out, she also filed a restraining order on him.\n\nHere’s why I resent her: she knew who he was. She experienced his abuse firsthand. She had already escaped him once. But she still chose to get back with him, and by doing that, she brought all that chaos back. not just into her life, but into mine. I was still a kid. I didn’t choose this. But I’ve had to deal with cops at the house, screaming matches, being kicked out, instability. all because she decided to give him another chance.\n\nI know abusive relationships are complicated. I know manipulation is real. But this wasn’t the first time. This wasn’t someone who didn’t know better. She knew exactly who he was—years before I was even born. And now I’m the one dealing with the consequences of her decision to come back.\n\nShe’s nice to me, yeah. But I can’t pretend like that makes it okay. I feel like my life would’ve been so different if she had just walked away that day in the store. And I hate that I think that.\n\nAITA for resenting her, even though she never directly hurt me?\n\nEDIT: just want to clear something up, because a lot of the responses are saying I’m “blaming the abused instead of the abuser,” and that’s not what I’m trying to do at all. To be 100% clear: I do hold my father responsible for everything he’s done. He is absolutely the root cause of the abuse and chaos. I’m not excusing him in any way. I’ve lived with him. I know how bad he is, and I’ve never once seen him as anything other than the main source of the problem. That said, this post wasn’t about him. This was about my feelings toward my stepmom specifically, someone who re-entered his life (and mine) after already having firsthand experience of what he’s capable of. She’s not the abuser, but her choices did have serious consequences for me, as a child caught in the middle.\n\nEDIT 2: this isn’t about blaming her for the abuse. he’s fully responsible for that. My issue is that she came back to him after 20+ years, knowing how bad things were back then, knowing he was already in a relationship, and even after being warned by his own mother not to get involved with him again. She still made the conscious decision to reinsert herself into his life, disrupt his current relationship, and be with him. He’s at fault too, obviously. but this post is about her choice to come back despite everything. Everyone under this post seems to believe that being a victim excuses you from also being partly to blame.",

Whoever is behind it asked her to ‘help pay for the players’ training.’ She sent them the money.\n\nWhen my dad found out, he told me about it and then asked me to talk to her. He said that since I’m the closest thing she has to a son, she might listen to me. I told her there are many reasons why I’m sure it’s a scammer. First, Arsenal doesn’t need the money. Second, no blue checkmark that official/verified accounts have. And finally, it’s an English club so you would expect them to have someone from England writing their correspondence. Or at least a person who speaks fluent English. But the English used by the person who messaged her is worse than mine, and I speak English as a second language. One sentence that stuck out to me was ‘We is struggling financially and needs your help.’ \n\nI told her the scammer must have noticed from her social media posts that she’s a fan of the team and targeted her for that reason. She refused to listen, choosing to trust the scammer’s word and repeatedly insisting that the club lost money recently. I tried talking to her again several times over the next month but she always said she knows what she is doing. So I told Dad that I don’t see any chance of convincing her. He said I shouldn’t just give up on my family like that.\n",

      "scenario_description": "Am I the asshole for telling My husband that I really don’t want to homeschool his kids? We have four kids, 2 teens and a 10 yo girl and 1 yo boy, one teen and the 10 yo are his from a previous woman, our 1yo is ours together and my teen daughter from my ex. He told me he really wants me to homeschool both his schoolage kids, his 10 yo is a handful, we have a mostly good relationship now but the first couple years was bumpy and she still has problems following rules and instructions, so I can imagine teaching her anything would put a serious wedge between us and his teen son doesn’t listen to me at all, he’s very disobedient. The school year when they go to school (very nice private school btw) it’s a nice break for me and I’m a sahm and I also help with his business on top of taking care of all house chores and cooking/shopping and the kids plus their homework and taking them to all after school and summer activities. I think I would lose my mind If I had to add homeschooling to my plate. Am I wrong for telling him I need that break each day away from the kids?\n\nEDIT: to answer any questions, he wants me to HS to avoid bad influence, but they have been going to school their entire school age lives, they have already been influenced, that ship sailed. \n\nI am 100% not qualified to teach, nor do I have the patience. When his daughter fell behind in math I would help her with homework, and even with all distractions off, she could not focus on the task and would bounce around, ask unrelated questions and not pay attention to what I am teaching. So I can imagine teaching her would be a nightmare for both of us. \n\nI get allowance each month plus bills paid, access to card and bank account, so our marriage outside of him bugging me about HS is great, he takes good care of us, but the fact that he’s asked so many times and I have told him that me teaching them would hurt their education and also our relationship plus the many other valid reasons and that still hasn’t deterred him makes me question if he truly sees everything I do and if it’s enough. I don’t want to be selfish, I would do anything for my kids and my family, but that also means putting my foot down on something that I know could be detrimental to them even if he doesn’t see it. ",
