      "scenario_description": "I (18F) have a sister (32F) who started working in early June. Since I'm currently off school for the year and usually wake up late, I've been helping her out by picking up my 4-year-old niece from school in the afternoons.\n\nRecently, my other sisters (30F and 16F) have been pressuring me to take more responsibility with my niece like dropping her off and picking her up more frequently because I'm at home and not working. On top of that, I've been attending all her school meetings and taking full responsibility for her after school, even though she's not my child.\n\nWhat really frustrates me is that my 30F sister keeps lying to our 32F sister, claiming that I don’t pick my niece up on time even though I'm the one doing nearly everything for her. She acts like she's the one taking care of my niece, when in reality, she does nothing!\n\nOne day, I was in the middle of sorting out and cleaning all my old school stuff when it was time to collect my niece. Since 30F was home, I asked if she could do the pickup. She agreed  then at the very last minute, she backed out and started making excuses.\n\nI decided to finish what I was doing because I didn’t want to leave a huge mess halfway through. An hour went by, and no one left to collect my niece. The school ended up calling my mom (54F) because no one had picked her up . My mom picked her up, and when she got home, she was furious **at me**, not at my 30F sister who had agreed and then flaked.\n\nEveryone in the house called me immature and selfish, saying I brought my niece into “petty drama” and that I should’ve just gone and gotten her. They also told me to just accept that my 30F sister is like this and be the “bigger person.”\n\nI feel like I'm being taken advantage of and blamed unfairly. AITA?\n\nUpdate: after reading some of the comments i get why people may think im at fault here, however you need to understand that my sister 30 F is unemployed and was also doing nothing in her day at the time  and was the main person collecting my niece before i finished school and i wanted a break from responsibilities thats why i wasnt working or finding a Job, as soon as she saw that i was home she used it as an opportunity to torment me.\n\nAlso for the comments telling me to get a job i just finished sixth form not long ago and had exams.  so is it wrong for me to want to relax before uni.\n\ni know that i was wrong to bring a innocent child into this drama but she constantly finds ways to torment me and everyone in my family turns a blind eye to it.",

There is a 16 year old and a 30 year old in the mix, the child’s mother and the grandmother.  This would not be a problem if everyone communicated.  \n\nDecide what you will do and don’t do and tell the mom.  It is up to her to figure out the rest.",

      "scenario_description": "My son has just had his 2nd birthday and we had a party for his friends from playgroup, my neighbour messaged me after the party saying 'the cherry on the cake' to all the shit going on in her life was that I didn't invite her autistic 8 year old son to his toddler party. \n\nShe's made me feel really guilty like I'm the reason for her upset.\n\nHer son is non verbal and smacks himself in the face if over stimulated. I didn't invite as it was a toddler party with only 5 2-3 year olds. \n\nMy living room isn't very big and I know her son is sensitive to loud noises and thought with all the screaming and fighting it wouldn't be a good idea. He also has to blow out candles even if its not his birthday, which, in my opinion isn't fair and would take focus off my boy.\n\nHe doesn't share toys and, in previous experiences, not even let my son play with his own toys in his own home, and even though the other children were fighting over toys, the parents, including mysel, were stopping snatching and inforcing sharing, even if it caused a tantrum.\n\nI am getting mixed reviews from people around me and I still personally didn't think it would be a good idea but she's made me feel like I was wrong for it.\n\nThank you for all or insights.. \n\nUpdate:-\nSince the party we had a little get together and the 2 toddlers were fighting and screaming about sharing his new toys, constantly trying to stop arguments and the neighbours son came along aswell, when ever the screaming started, it was as I feared the loud noises were too much, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere for the neighbours boy, covering his ears,  sprinting out into the communal gardens, as if he was trying to escape. It started off quietly, but then, as the toddlers got tired, it leveled up gradually. \n",

I \\[f/27\\] am usually the only one who takes out the rubbish, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw him taking out the rubbish for once. Little to my knowledge, when he took the bag of rubbish outside, the outdoor bin was already full- with the top being some loose items- like his old baseball caps and other random items I had throw out from a wardrobe clean-out earlier in the week. He had opened up the bin, pulled all of these loose items out, thrown them on the ground beside the bin and put the bag in and then walked back inside. He didn't say a word and I only realized this morning when I got in my car to go to work and saw all the rubbish beside the house. I was running late so I didn't pick it up.\n\nWhen I got home, I brought in the empty bins from the street and set them beside the rubbish that was strewn across the footpath/driveway beside the house - leaving the mess for him to clean up. He gets home not long after and comes inside and asks \"why didn't you put the bins back where they go?\" and I responded \"because you left rubbish all over the ground\". His smirk quickly turned into a scowl and he says \"well I guess the bins are staying where they are then\". I responded by saying \"You made the mess, why is it up to me to clean up after you?\" and he just closed the door and walked away. He's been in a fowl mood ever since and is barely acknowledging me. \n\nAm I the asshole for not cleaning up his mess? I really don't understand the logic behind pulling loose items out of a bin when he could have simply placed the bag beside the bin and waited until it was emptied to put it in. I'm bothered because I pretty much always do all of the household chores (aside from handy work, which he does) and feel like I'm always expected to clean up after him. He even scolds me for putting away items he constantly leaves laying around the house, and gets annoyed when I wash his laundry because \"it wasn't even dirty\" - yet it was in the pile of dirty clothes in the bathroom, right next to the laundry basket.\n\n*EDIT* \nThe items of his that were thrown away were done so with his full consent. I didn't just chuck out his stuff. His mum actually dropped off boxes of his things months ago when she was doing her own clean out. It sat in the hall untouched for over a week before I went through each item one by one with him to figure out what he wanted to keep and what he wanted to throw away. Everything he wanted to chuck went in a box that has been sitting in our wardrobe for weeks with the intention to donate, but the hats were old and not in the best shape so I just tipped them into the bin!  Hope that clears up any idea that he did this out of spite. Not at all the case. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (28M) recently started a new job in tech that pays really well. Honestly, it's the most money I've ever made in my life, and it's completely changed how I live. I grew up in a single parent household, and my older sister (32F) was a huge part of my life when we were kids. Our mum worked two jobs, so my sister kind of took on a parental role when she was still just a teenager. She cooked for me, helped me with homework, made sure I got to school on time. I’ve always been thankful for that.\n\nThe issue is, her adult life has been pretty messy. She’s never been great with money. She's bounced from job to job, tried a bunch of different \"business ideas\" that didn’t go anywhere, and constantly asks people to loan her money or invest in things. She doesn’t have any savings and has borrowed from our cousins, our mum, and even old friends. A lot of those relationships are strained now.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, she called me and said she was being evicted. She asked if I could give her $5,000 to help her stay in her place. She said she'd pay me back as soon as things \"picked up.\" That’s something she’s said before.\n\nI told her that I couldn’t give her that kind of money right now. I’ve been saving up for a house deposit and trying to be smart with my finances. She got really upset and told me that I wouldn’t even be where I am if it weren’t for her raising me. She said she gave up her childhood for me and that I’m basically abandoning her now that I’ve \"made it.\"\n\nI tried to explain that I appreciate everything she did when we were kids, but I also can’t keep giving out money when I know there's a good chance I’ll never see it again. She hung up on me.\n\nNow our mum is texting me saying my sister is sleeping on her couch and that she’s in a really tough spot. She says I’m turning my back on the one person who was always there for me.\n\nI feel guilty. I really do. But I also feel like my sister brings these situations on herself and expects other people to fix them. I’m not sure what the right thing to do is anymore.\n\nAITA for not helping her this time?",

You can sit down with her and go over her finances, her spending.  See where she can cut back and where she can make improvements.  Does she have a job?  If not, she needs to get one and establish a reliable income.  No more risky business ventures until she has her own money to back them.  \n\nYou are correct in that she makes her own choices, brings this situation upon herself and now has reached the end of her rope where others are done loaning her money or bailing her out.  Your own mother admitting that she was not there for you.  Many parents work two jobs and were still there for their children.  \n\nIf she needs to sleep on mom’s couch until she can save, get back on her feet, so be it.  But you helping by paying her debt, is not going to help your sister in the long run.  She needs to take accountability for her actions.  \n\nIf you want to and are able to, I would not give her money directly ever.  Find out exactly how much she owes for back rent.  Find out why she owes this.  I would pay any money you wish to offer directly to her landlord. \n\nIf sister is willing to sit down with you and go over everything, then she does not want help.  She wants another handout.  And she will not learn and keep coming back for more.  \n\nAnd now you can say, “This is how I can help you for all you have done for me.  I will help you get back on track if you are willing.  It will take a lot of work and determination from you.  But I cannot and will not just give you money to solve your immediate problems.  Because you will continue to expect and not actually work for yourself and your future”.",

      "scenario_description": "I had a friend come visit from out of town for a long weekend. We've been friend over 20 years,  and I was excited to see her.\n\nShe's had cats in the past, but married someone who is highly allergic to almost anything with fur, so she hasn't had any furred pets in many years (she has some reptiles). I have nurmerous cats, and she was also excited to get a weekend of kitties.\n\nHowever, it became clear very quickly that she doesn't live with cats. Leaving food unattended, putting cups on the edge of the coffee table/counter, etc, made it a very messy weekend. But whatever, right?\n\nThen there was the dental floss.\n\nFor context here, one of my cats ate a string he pulled out of a rug several months ago, and I paid THOUSANDS to save him. Like, he should have died - not only was it a very long string, but he had numerous post-op complications. But he is my baby, and it was money well spent to me. My cat learned exactly nothing from the experience - he still LOVES string and hair ties, and I am hypervigilant about such things being left out where he can access them.\n\nI told my friend she CANNOT throw dental floss in the bathroom trash - it has to go in the kitchen trash. The bathroom trash had a lid, but this cat is very smart and very determined. And in the event the lid doesn't get closed, it's essentially leaving string right at cat-height.\n\nWell, she didn't get the (very direct, not even a hint) hint. I kept finding floss in the bathroom trash, and twice I found it just laying on the counter, waiting to be swallowed. The first couple times, I tried to gently remind her. Then I directly told her again. When I found floss, yet again, just laying on the counter, I told her she needed to hand over her floss. I have the little floss picks she can use, but I cannot have long strings just being left around the house willy nilly. I cannot afford to have another major emergency vet surgery. I was not rude about it, and I did not yell or anything, but it was just too big a risk to keep allowing her to leave it lying about. \n\nShe complied, but after she went home her husband called me and said I was being totally put of line and treating her like a child, and that I should be more concerned with teaching my cat not to eat string. I do sort of see his point, but the reality is I tried to remind her not to do it, and it wasn't sticking. It's literally  a safety issue in my home - one that could mean life or death. If she couldn't manage to dispose of floss in the kitchen, then my only choice to protect my dumb ass cat is to remove the dangerous item. There is no \"teaching\" a cat to not use their insticts, and hunting/eating things is instinct.\n\nAITA here? I feel like no, but the way her husband acted, I'm now not totally sure.\n\n(And yes, I gave her floss back before she left. I'm not a floss thief)",

      "scenario_description": "TLDR: SIL didn't want to go to my husband's birthday party and is now expecting us to plan another since she can't afford to host another one herself. WIBTA for saying no?\n\nHis birthday was last month. His family is obsessed with celebrating birthdays, even though we are all 30yo+. That's fine, but you can understand how hard it is to get 10+ family and friends together for every single birthday when everyone is working different schedules.\n\nWhen his birthday was approaching, I had heard nothing about plans but knew his sister had bought him tons of gifts, so I stepped up and sent out an invite for something my husband wanted to do - a barbecue at the beach. Free, relaxing, and a chance to enjoy the beautiful weather. \n\nHis sister responded, disappointed, that she and her family would actually prefer dinner at a restaurant because they want to be indoors/in the AC. My first thoughts were that, if you are invited to an event that you can't or don't want to attend for some reason, asking the host to cancel or change those plans entirely is quite rude. \n\nIn an effort to stand our ground, we let them know we were going ahead with the barbecue, but if they wanted to plan a separate birthday dinner, they were welcome to. \n\nSo, SIL chooses this upcoming weekend for a family-feast-style dinner at a nearby restaurant. Neat! We adjust our schedules to accomodate. As the day approaches, husband reaches out to sister to ask what the plans are. Turns out, she has nothing planned - hasn't invited anyone else, hasn't made reservations, and hasn't looked at the menu to calculate the cost breakdown. \n\nThe family meals at the restaurant come to $120 each, feeding 4 people. That would feed SIL's family alone. With the rest of us added, we would need at least 2 meals to feed everyone. When we talked all this over with SIL, she realized that the cost splitting would still be over $30pp. That's when she admitted that they just paid their bills and can't afford it.\n\nNo worries. Sorry it didn't work out!\n\nNope. She's now asking *us* to plan something else, something that's less expensive, because she's out of ideas. \"Can we have the party at your place?\" Why, so I get to buy all the food and stress about prepping the apartment to host on short notice? \"Wish we could, but our house is a mess while we're reorganizing\". She is currently waiting for us to think of something else.\n\nConsidering: 1) we already hosted a birthday party that she didn't want to go to, 2) her poor planning would have ended with us footing a $200+ bill, and 3) the series of inconsiderate requests, my husband and I are ready to cancel. Knowing this would break her heart, WIBTA?",

He spends the Sabbath with friends, which is fine with us.

I cook and bake a lot. I like having two ovens. I don’t want to relive the exhaustion of a kosher (semi-kosher) kitchen, though I could.\n\nAITA for not accommodating my son’s religious beliefs to the best of my ability rather than a baseline level?",

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "My younger sister is temporarily living with us and she was having a hard time studying because my 3 y.o. son would constantly interrupt and ask her to play with him whenever she was studying in the living room/kitchen. She asked if she could use my husband’s office so he wouldn’t bother her and I agreed since my husband wasn’t in the country (he lives abroad about 70% of the time) at the time anyway.\n\nI don’t think I did anything wrong but my husband came home as a surprise before the office had been cleaned up and he was angry at me for letting her use it without asking him first. Like I said he wasn’t in the country and he wasn’t supposed to visit any time soon so I thought it would be fine since it’s not like he needed it at the time. He doesn’t see it the same way and thinks I should’ve asked first since it’s his office.\n\nWe’ve had a few arguments over this with neither of us budging. Admittedly in our last fight I did get angry and tell him he shouldn’t even have a home office since he’s barely home which did unfortunately escalate the fight. Part of the reason I said that is because my husband was never happy about my sister living here even though it’s had a very minimal impact on him and I feel like he’s using this office situation as an opening to send her back home.\n\nI've already bought a desk for her room so she can study in there but AITA?",

His family spends a lot of time together—holidays, weekends, and frequent get-togethers with all the siblings and grandkids.\n\nJohn’s dad retired this past May, and we already had a retirement party for him. Now his parents have planned a family vacation in November to celebrate his retirement again. They rented a large house out of state and invited everyone—siblings, spouses, grandkids, etc.—for a full week: Saturday to Saturday.\n\nJohn and I were clear from the beginning that we probably wouldn’t stay the entire time. I’ve always expressed that Thanksgiving is an important holiday for me to spend with my own family, and John told his parents early on that he wasn’t sure we’d stay the full week because it was a long trip. We decided we’d attend the trip from Saturday through Wednesday, then head home so we could spend Thanksgiving with my family.\n\nSince then, there’s been some subtle pushback. His parents have said things like, “It’s just one Thanksgiving,” or asked if John could stay even if I left. They’ve also said this is the first time the whole family is doing a trip like this in years and it might not happen again.\n\nI understand they’re excited about the trip, and we’re not trying to skip it—we’re planning to be there for five full days. But I don’t think it’s fair to expect every adult to give up a full week of their own time and holiday plans, especially when we made our intentions clear up front.\n\nAITA for not wanting to stay the full week, even if it’s disappointing to his parents?\n\nEdit: Many people asked about the \"subtle pushback\" It was subtle as in they are communicating with John. His mom blew up when they asked about booking flights and he said yep our plan is to come Saturday to Wednesday to get back to OP's family for Thanksgiving since it's important to her.\n\nShe went off saying \"it's just one\" \"she can't miss just one\" and \"can't you just stay\"? Then he left that conversation upset and we got in an argument about holding the boundary because he is a peacekeeper and tends to people please.\n\nThen a couple weeks later they asked him to come for dinner and both his mom and dad pressed more saying \"it's just one\" \"can't you just stay\" and then they told him \"he needs to advocate for himself.\"\n\nHe was great about all of this. He held the boundary and told them this is a WE decision and that this is what WE are comfortable with. He told them he doesn't want to be away from his fiance on the holiday.",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (26f) got married last month and I (29f) thought everything went ok. She had a beautiful venue, but I thought her wedding was a bit trashy.\n\nHer dress was beautiful if cheap. It was a midi dress with off the shoulder sleeves. I advised her to cover her arms because she’s got a “patchwork” tattoo sleeve on her left arm and I asked her if she really wanted a mouse in a party hat or a cowboy cat in her wedding photos. To which she said, “I think it’ll look sick as hell.”\n\nShe looked beautiful on her wedding day aside from her tattoos and the bit of rodent pee she got on her dress from when she insisted on taking pictures with her “babies”.\n\nThen for the reception she ordered pizza and had a Walmart sheet cake. Why? So she could spend money on a bounce house and ballpit.\n\nI thought the worst part of her wedding was that she didn’t allow kids to come to save money and because in her words “kids can be attention whores”. So I had to pay $100 for a sitter in addition to the $200 I gave them as a wedding gift.\n\nAt the end of the night, she and a bunch of party guests ended up jumping into the pool at her hotel because she “thought it would be fun” and bribed the night manager at the hotel to open the pool again so they could swim for a bit which I thought was rude. So her wedding dress and her husband’s suit was ruined from that.\n\nYesterday, we were going through the photos and she said that she had the time of her life and everything went perfect. I mentioned that I thought it was a bit immature and she said I was just a stick in the mud and if I could let loose for 5 minutes, I could’ve had fun too. I tried to show her where I was coming from but her husband stepped in and said if I didn’t have anything nice to say, I shouldn’t say anything at all and that even his 5th grade students knew that. I didn’t say anything else about it but what she said still kinda hurts.\n\nAITA for saying that I though my sisters wedding was immature and trashy?",

      "scenario_description": "I 28 (F) am married to my husband 32 (M) we got married in 2022 and since getting engaged things with my MIL have just gotten worse and worse over the years. We are going on a trip to WI in August to see my husbands extended family. Originally we planned to stay at an air bnb with my MIL, FIL, BIL and his fiancé. We booked the VRBO in Sept of 2024 and things with my MIL have really hit a tipping point\n\nIn Nov we found out we were pregnant with our second baby. My MIL never once congratulated me or even said anything about my pregnancy after my husband told them when they had lunch together without me in Feb. In early April we tragically lost our baby at 21 weeks when my water broke. My MIL never once checked in on my husband to see how everyone was doing after the loss of our baby and two trips to the ER due to complications. Every text and call she made after our loss was to see when she could see our living child because she HAD to see him and spend time with him. Flash forward to Easter, my MIL comes to Easter at my parents house and doesn't speak to me the entire time and did not once try to interact with our living child. She left Easter in a fit for an unknown reason, said goodbye to no one and sat in the car and cried. \n\nMIL has not spoken to us since Easter, including when my husband called and texted on Mother's Day. We learned from BIL that they had debated getting their own VRBO but realized how close it was to all the family we would be visiting. So she changed her mind and told BIL that she would stay at the VRBO with us still but would not speak to me or my husband. \n\nI want to tell her that she is no longer welcome to stay with us and that she needs to find her own place. Would I be the asshole? \n\n\n\nEDIT: Since many people have asked in the comments.\n\nI did try to interact with her at Easter, she would either brush me off or walk away. My husband interacted with her but at the end when she was leaving when my husband tried to say goodbye to her she just shook her head no and walked away to the car. We don’t know why she’s mad, we don’t know what happened, she’s not speaking to me or my husband and just started speaking to BIL again 2 weeks ago\n\nLeading up to this: our relationship went downhill when my husband and I got engaged but I tried for years before that to keep the peace and make everyone happy. I made sure my husband called her back and reached out, i made plans with them, bought every gift for her for every holiday, and tried to include her when I could in things. \n\nShe often goes months without speaking to us in the years leading up to this vacation. This is not new or uncommon at all. She does the same to BIL and his fiancé and she will go months with barely speaking to her own husband. \n\nWe got engaged in 2020, and before that I had a decent relationship with my MIL. We went on vacations and road trips together with no issues and we would text casually from time to time. The first issue was my bridal shower, my mom and MOH planned the shower and my mom asked MIL to help. MIL has a huge issue with her sister and doesn’t want to be around her but still goes to NFL games with her and sits 3 people away from her for all home games with no issues. Back to the bridal shower, my mom asked MIL to help and MIL cried and threw a fit saying she wouldn’t come to the shower if her sister was there. So my mom and MOH uninvited her sister to keep the peace. I didn’t know until after the event and got asked by his family why MIL sister wasn’t there and had to face handling that even though I wanted her there. After that it was the rehearsal dinner, MIL planned the whole thing without us even though we asked to be part of the planning. So we ended up having big Italian two nights in a row because she picked an Italian restaurant and we served Italian at the wedding. \n\nAfter that was missing our sons (her first grandchild’s) baby shower because we invited her sister and told her that her sister was invited beforehand so it wasn’t a shock to her. Again she sits 3 people away from her all football season. \n\nThen our son was born and we asked that we have some time to adjust to life as parents before having visitors (this applied to my parents too). She did not like having to wait the two weeks it took for us to feel ready. While he was little she was constantly telling us “it’s time that you do…” all regarding things with our son; letting her babysit, letting her kiss him, letting her feed him(he was exclusively breast fed), letting her take him out for the day, etc. \n\nThen at my son’s first birthday she took a video of everyone singing happy birthday to him and I was sitting right next to her. I magically didn’t make it into the video and when we asked her about it she said “I didn’t want to ruin the video” meaning she didn’t want to have to turn the orientation of the video to fit me into it. But you can clearly see in the video that when I lean in towards my son. She moves the camera away each time to try and keep me out of the video. \n\nThen to the loss of our second baby, she did not show up for us during our grief at all. Not once did she check in on us after we tragically lost a baby and only asked about seeing our living son. Not once did she offer help or ask what we needed. Just demanded to see our son while we were in thick of losing a baby halfway through a pregnancy. \n\nSo yes, I tried for years but I reached my point of no longer being able to try with her for my own sake and well being so I don’t try anymore and my husband knows this and is on board with me keeping my distance to protect myself. He knows I want low contact with her but that’s a difficult thing to do without also cutting down his contact with his dad. I take his lead on how much we see his parents and I would never stop him from seeing them. He also chooses to not see them much and to not bring our son to see them unless we’ve invited them to see him or it’s an event\n\nHope that helps clear things up",
