      "scenario_description": "My grandmother and I always had a positive relationship, she’s always been my safe haven and I always looked up to her for the woman she is. Over a while ago, I hit a rough patch (and my car was having issues), I decided to ask my grandmother to stay with her for a short while until I gained enough time to get back on my feet again. She agreed and I signed papers for my stay. In exchange I would do chores or takes for her around the house. Over the time I was with her, she started acting strangely. When I asked her for assistance with some personal tasks she showed no distress towards me about it. After and during it was happening she dismissed me and began to look at me in a suspiciously maniacal way as if she thought I was up to something or lying to her. Any information I would tell her she would continuously dismiss and demand information about it for herself because she wants to see on her own (even though I showed her the evidence and she would hear it as well). Nothing moved her. During that time, she would inadvertently accuse me of doing illegal substances and drinking alcohol at her house when I never done any of those things at all. (She accused me of being high on a few occasions when I was just exhausted, I also have a sleeping disorder) When I would discuss with her about my time with new and old friends over the years, she would passive aggressively tell me I need to no longer do what they did but I was only mentioning good and hard times. Eventually, what pushed me over the edge was when she decided to do something that I needed to get done and tell me that I don’t owe her anything. Thereafter when I don’t exchange information that was significantly irrelevant or when something is resolved or doesn’t go her way even when I explain it her she threatens to take it back or kick me out constantly. When I expressed to her that those behaviors were inappropriate, she just dismissed me and told me she doesn’t care about how I felt, and would complain about how long I was talking to her (even though I talked to her for less than 5 minutes) interrupting me while I was talking and proceeded to call me narcissistic. During these conversations, or after my aunt or uncle or people she have went to church with would show up when it took already took a drastic turn. Then they would blame me and say I was purposely arguing with her and acting irrationally. Later on, I moved in with an old roommate. What should I do?",

      "scenario_description": "I (23F) have a brother (18M) and my mother who have been living with me for two years. My brother recently dropped out of HS didn’t get a GED. After he decided that he would not finish school I set a deadline of him finding a job within a month. Another month passed and I informed mom of me limiting the privileges I give him which is the internet. A bad day came when I asked if he could take my dog outside in the morning and he did not do it until very late so my dog peed all over the floor and dragged it on the new carpet he did not let me know because he wanted to keep playing games so it soaked into the everwhere, this infuriated me and I let him know that everything costs money and I am sick of him not being considerate of the things that are around him. I informed him that I would be removing his internet and I did. When my spouse was back we discussed a solid plan to get him to start doing better and set him up for success which was that if he got a GED I would give him back the internet for 3-4 hours a day and once he got a job all privileges would be returned to him. When my mom was informed of this she immediately got mad at me and threatened that they would move out. Another month passed and I just thought maybe he is studying or at least applying for a job but he was doing none. I started to get a bit more frustrated at this time because I see no progress and stated to blame me for his depression because he has no internet. Today he decided to come to me after being rude to me all week and refusing to do any chores I give him, to ask if he could be on the internet to get some limited edition stuff on one of his games. I told him he couldn’t because he has had a lot of time to get at least a GED to have some internet and that consequences are consequences so he would have to miss out. He began walking away calling me bitch. Once my mom got home I told her what had happened so she could at least tell him to respect me and she said that I was in the wrong that it was just a bit of time he would be on the internet and proceeded to tell me to return it to him to which I informed her that consequences are consequences and he had full control of gaining internet access once he did the right thing. My mom exploded once I told her that and once again started to threaten me saying she has no say in anything that happens in the house or even control over her kid. She said she would just find a place to live and that I was very hard on him and my consequences are just like Nazis. My mother said that she is just trying to protect her boy from me and once she said this I was upset and told her I am not a Nazi for enforcing boundaries to him trying to financially and emotionally take advantage of me. I told her to do whatever she wanted to do and that if she thinks leaving is best she should do it.",

However he said it’s all good because his wife will help pay for rent until his finds a job. Fast forward a month, my wife tells me he’s about to sign a 2.5k a month lease for 12 months for a 3 bedroom apartment. I told her financially, it was a bad idea considering he doesn’t have a job and they could find something cheaper and wtf you need 3bed rooms for?. BIL once again says he’s good and his wife agreed to pay rent when they both signed the lease. \n\n\n\nJust yesterday my wife’s tells me he needs help paying rent for this month. Turns out he only had money for the first two months for rent. So he asked his wife to help and she apparently refused. So I said ok well then they both will get evicted. It was causal talk until my wife dropped the hammer….turns out apparently BIL wife is blackmailing him to pay all the rent regardless if he has a job or not. Wife and I don’t know what the black mail is and BIL won’t tell us. Then my wife asked if I could help him pay rent. I said: \n\n“After my repeated advise was ignored, if your brother was hanging on a cliff and I was on the edge of the cliff and I had a pocket full of fucks and he only need one to be saved, I WOULD NOT GIVE A SINGLE FUCK” \n\nAfter reflecting later, I realized that comment was a bit harsh but idk. I was just furious at the situation, I was raised to be very mindful of my financials and this is not the first time he’s asked for money. Whenever we go out, I’m always paying. I do not expect it back, but there’s no way I can lend him 2.5k for poor decisions he’s made. \n\nI’m afraid my refusal will put my marriage in jeopardy because of BIL\n\nWhat do I do ? \n\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "Me 45f and my husband 50m in were at a resort with a pool. We were sitting at the swim up bar and we noticed that some of the loungers that are on a ledge in the pool were being vacated by a couple. There were tons of these loungers open but this particular set had an umbrella.  The couple in the chairs got up and walked away. We got up from the bar and went to the hot tub. When we got back 15 mins later those two loungers were empty. The couple who was in the chairs had left their towels on the pool deck behind the chairs and a small bag. While we were lounging the wife comes back. She tells me we stole her chairs. An argument ensued. I said these chairs are not reservable and you left. She said I know they aren’t reservable but we were just going to the water slide. I said you have been gone awhile so the seats are up for grabs. She leaves and comes back with her husband who says let’s just go. She keeps arguing with me saying these were their chairs and they just went to go down the slide. Her husband convinces her to leave after saying that people like me are what’s wrong with the world. I said no it’s people like you that feel like you are entitled in a public area to hog and hold chairs.   As she is leaving she tosses her cup at my back.  So, AITA.  I can’t attach the picture but it’s a huge hotel pool with a ledge. There are easily 100 of these loungers. Only 6 are under an umbrella. Tons of chairs are open when she approaches me. ",

      "scenario_description": "Alt account so I don't doxx my main. \n\nMy ex and I split up about three years ago. No bad feelings, we just drifted apart until we realised that we were now co-parents not husband and wife any more. We have two kids, 13 and 10. My ex used to work as an infrastructure engineer and I was working as an owner driver with my own truck.\n\nAt around the time the kids were born we decided she was going to be a stay at home mum, the trucking was going well and I had brought a second truck and a van so I stayed home doing all the planning and admin, while I had the trucks and van out.\n \nWhen the smallest started school the ex went back to work part-time but her time out of the workforce had hit her really hard and she needed to learn lots of stuff and basically she couldn't get back in at her previous level and had to pretty much start over. Over the years the haulage firm had expanded and frankly it was getting a bit of a pain in the arse, we were too big for where we were and were needing to move to a new yard so I sold it off for a reasonable sum and set up freelancing as a dev. (Did Computer Science at Uni). \n\nWe both had relatives pass away leaving us property and money. So we were mortgage free on the family home. When we split, I moved into a house that I had inherited, we basically split the assets in half, split the costs of the kids activities in half. And when we were sat looking at the money she concluded that she would need to go back to work full time and she would miss time with the kids, as they were with me the three days she was at work and every other weekend I felt a bit bad for that, because if she hadn't  been out of work for so long then she would be in a better place career wise. \n\nSo I offered to cover half of her bills until the kids went off to uni. She didn't want to at first but I said to her that she helped me out and had now suffered as a result so it was only fair that I returned the favour, it's helping my kids out, and I didn't want her to be running down the savings that was essentially the kids inheritance. \n\nSo this situation has worked out about as well as it can, we co-parent happily, everything is all good. Until she met a new guy. He's someone we knew from way back but we lost touch with. They started dating, she's really happy and she's talking about him moving in. Which I'm ok with, the kids get on with him and I trust her judgement and know that she wouldn't put anything ahead of the kids.\n\nSo I said to her, if laddo is moving in you won't need the money towards the bills will you? She said no she wouldn't, but she was thinking of putting it into the kids accounts. Great idea says me. I'll put some on their cards for pocket money and the rest in their savings. So that was what we agreed. \n\nBut when new chap found out he went up the wall and accused me of being controlling and financial abuse. A few of our friends have also said that he's got a point and that it looks like jealousy. So AITA here?\n\n\nUPDATE:\nEDITS and clarification:\n\nWe have joint 50/50 custody of the kids so I have no actual obligation to be paying anything, but that said, I don't want my kids to miss out on their many and varied activities so I carry on paying for half of those. Likewise I offered the extra money to help with bills because I wanted my kids to benefit from time with both parents and also to not have to live in a house where money is a worry. \n\nSome have mentioned when division of assets from inheritance and selling my business, these are mostly locked away in long term investments so they aren't available. We were perhaps unwise in doing this, but we saw it as the kids' inheritance. My ex would rather have worked more than dipped into that money for living costs. \n\nThe ex has been round for a cup of tea and a chat, it seems that laddo was indeed thinking that she was his meal ticket, apparently he had suggested moving in but NOT told her that his landlord was ending his tenancy on a section 21 to sell the property. When she started discussing money and his contribution he asked why when I was paying for the kids. So she told him if he was living there he needed to chip in, and that if he moved in she couldn't keep asking for money from me.\n\nSo she's upset and I think that's going to be over, in the meantime he's ranting to anyone that'll listen that I'm the typical evil jealous ex and controlling her with money.

      "scenario_description": "I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. \n\nIn the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. \n\nI am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. \n\nThey’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. \n\nYesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. \n\nI had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. \n\nMy kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. \n\nBut afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. \n\nSo AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",

You have a husband and three capable teens who are all able bodied.  \n\nShould you have to set different expectations now?  No,  but now you have to change the dynamics that were a set pattern in your household.  \n\nSit down and write down what needs to get done, what everyone is complaining about.  What chores need to be done on a regular basis.  \n\nAnd then you have another family meeting.  And you tell them this is a home, not a hotel.  Everyone has responsibilities outside the home but that does negate the responsibilities inside the home.  Here is what I will do and here is the rest.  The four of you are capable of doing them.  The four of you can figure out who does what.  This will be the new normal.  Because I am no longer doing it all.",

      "scenario_description": "New to writing on Reddit and on mobile so obligatory apologies.\n\nI think this is the place I’m supposed to post this here, but it’s a pretty funny and wholesome story. If not, redirect me where to post the story.\n\nSo me (45 female) kept getting pissed off that my husband (52 male) kept peeing on the floor around the toilet. We’ve been together 12 years. For these 12 years, I’ve been getting pissed off that he’s been missing the toilet and peeing on the floor. I’m sick of getting wet socks when I go to the toilet and it’s so annoying and frustrating and to be frankly disgusting. Ive been sick of cleaning up his pee. I’ve not yelled at him, but have sternly talked to him about it and he swears that he is not missing the toilet. I keep arguing “Then why is there so much pee all around the toilet?”  He is confused and started sitting down to pee.  Even after he started sitting down to pee, there is still pee all around the toilet and I kept asking him, “Are you putting your penis down into the toilet or is it springing out of the toilet?” He looked at me very confused and said “No! I am peeing into the toilet. I don’t know why there is still pee all around the toilet.”\n\nI’ve asked him if he feels emasculated by sitting down to pee, and he has actually told me it feels more comfortable to sit down to pee. So I’m assuming I’ll have to be the asshole for that.\n\nSeveral months have gone by and then I realized … my dog drinks out of the toilet. He is a slobbery gross Doggo. He’s the best, but he drools and slobbers everywhere. These past years, it has not been my husband getting his pee everywhere, but the dog drinking out of the toilet and slobbering all over the floor. (Yes, we flush. My slobbering hound isn’t drinking pee water.)\n\nAs soon as I realized this, I apologized profusely to my husband that I’ve been giving him shit for the past 10 years for peeing on the floor.\n\nSo I guess Reddit, am I the asshole for giving my husband shit for peeing on the floor when this whole time it’s actually been my dog drinking out the toilet and slobbering everywhere?\n\nETA: I accept my YTA conviction! 😂 I wished I’d added how humorous we have both thought this has been over the years and I’ve never actually berated him or shamed him. He’s was just as concerned as I was. The reason I thought it was pee was because thick, yellow liquid was building up around the connection screws in the toilet to the floor. We moved last year and we realized it was a shitty rental and the sticky, stinky yellow liquid was probably regular bathroom condensation causing the screws to rust. \n\nWhen I noticed the dog was the culprit, I ran into the living room hysterically laughing! I told my husband how sorry I was a thousand times for teasing him these past years and he began laughing, too. He tackled me and we had a good laugh wrestle! 🤭🥰 We never actually yell or say mean things to each other. He’s actually still sitting to pee because he says it’s just more comfortable. \n\nSo, I’m probably still the asshole, we lovingly call each other assholes all the time, flipping each other off is our love language, but there’s some clarification on the subject. Hope you guys enjoyed our stupid decade long debacle. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤭\n\nETA for more info. My dog has two giant bowls of fresh, filtered well water I rinse and refill daily, regardless if it’s empty or not. I don’t want him drinking slobber water. Eww! I love my dog like my own child. He’s also very clever. He’s apparently only been drinking from the toilet when we’re either asleep or away, when is when I’d usually find the wet spots, so no, I haven’t caught him until this one time his trickery got the best of him. \n\nThis was one of my first Reddit posts and realized very quickly… more context is needed! 😂 And thank you to the Redditor that suggested this should have been posted on TIFU instead. You are correct and thank you! 🥰",

      "scenario_description": "AITA:\n\nUpdate: I did get an apology text from her after I made this post. She stated she had a hard weekend and didn’t realize I had sent her a text. She stated that she was sad that she didn’t get to say good bye. She did understand the severity of Mom tripping over Salem l and why I made the decision so abruptly. She also told me that she really wouldn’t have been able to take her back because she got a new dog that wasn’t cat friendly.\n\nI need to give some background before I share my current situation. For the past six months, I’ve been caring for my mother-in-law. During this time, she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Dementia. She is now severely impaired because of it. We’re also in the process of moving due to my husband’s military orders, and since he’s currently away at a school, I’ve been managing everything at home on my own.\n\nLast month, my neighbor asked if I could take in their 6-year-old cat because she wasn’t doing well in their home. Poor thing was over-grooming to the point that half her body was bald. I told them I could take her temporarily since my husband was away, but I wasn’t sure we would be her forever home. Since then, I’ve had her spayed and fully vetted (she had never been to the vet before). Her hair is now growing back beautifully. We also found out she was allergic to the cheap flea treatment they had given her.\n\nHowever, things have gotten complicated. My MIL has started hallucinating and wandering. I had to install curtains over our doors to prevent her from leaving in the middle of the night. The cat constantly climbs the curtains and has pulled them down more than once. She also kneads like many cats do, and while it’s harmless for most, it causes scratches on my MIL, who isn’t able to push her away. We recently had to start antibiotics due to a particularly nasty scratch being infected.\n\nThis weekend, my MIL stumbled over the cat and fell. That was the last straw, and I started looking for a new home for her. She’s a great kitty but my MIL being comfortable in her end of life is more important. I met with a wonderful family today and they adopted her. \n\nNow my neighbor is furious. She said that if I didn’t want the cat, I should’ve told her or given her back. I was basically berated for rehoming the cat. I did tell her in the beginning there could be a possibility that I rehoused her.\n\nSo now I’m wondering—AITA? Was I truly in the wrong here?",

      "scenario_description": "So my spouse has this friend who keeps having mail sent to our house. Idk why, he has a house, but yet he has all his mail sent here. For the first *three months* I didn't have an issue with it but a few weeks ago he had something important sent to the house that he needed asap. He wanted my husband to bring it to him but when my husband when out for drinks he forgot the letter. The next morning (a saturday) this dude calls us over a dozen times at 6am... like my husband didn't answer the first time so his \"friend\" just started calling again and again and again in a super passive aggressive fashion. Eventually my spouse answered the call, grabbed the letter and went to bring it to his \"friend\" like some servant. It was not a pleasant way to be woken up and I told my spouse to tell his friend that we aren't the post office and that he can send his mail elsewhere. Hubby, who is incredibly too kind, thinks I'm over reacting. I dropped the issue but today I found not one but *four* peices of mail including a new bank card and something thick and important looking from the social security office. I haven't told my spouse these letters arrived yet because i know he'll just deliver them and it'll continue the problem. I'm really really tempted to just return the mail to sender. Would I be the AH if I did? \n\nCaveat: the \"friend\" is *not* disabled and he *does* have a car and a job. Literally no reason that he can't go get a po box. ",

      "scenario_description": "For context, my extended family (about ten to twelve of us), a lot of our family friends, and I (16f) have a tradition where we play bingo together twice a year, and it is always a big group. We usually play six games per night, and cash prizes are generally given to the winner of each game, ranging from $40 to $80 - it is a \"pay-to-play\" and the proceeds are used to fund the prizes. I enjoy playing bingo and always have a nice time, but I have been doing it for about seven years now with my family, and every year, there has been a so-called \"collective,\" or a group of family members who have decided to share any winnings evenly among the members of the collective. Originally, this began when my cousins and I were younger and felt very jealous if anyone but us won, and, of course, as we've gotten older, we have grown out of that, but the collective has remained a persistent presence in bingo night.\n\nHere is where the conflict begins: I don't like taking part in the collective because a.) I don't think it's fair for me to take other people's winnings, and b.) I don't think it's necessary to share my own if I win. Maybe this is petty, but it has caused a rift between me and my mom in terms of bingo night, because the vast majority of my family joins the collective and I am often the black sheep who doesn't participate. My mom has told me that feels like I am being \"anti-social\" and \"disagreeable\" by not participating, and she made it clear that she didn't like how the collective would be rooting against me (in favor of themselves) and vice-versa. I also likened the collective to communism, which was a joke, but I wonder if my mom thought that I was being rude for no reason. Either way, I don't think this is a big issue, and so I didn't agree that I am disrupting the family bingo night by not taking part in the collective, but maybe I am the asshole because I am making a point of \"rebelling\" and purposefully not being part of the team that my family has created. \n\nMy family is made up of many team players, so I can understand that aspect, and I guess it's fair to not want someone to rock the boat because it might create a little bit of awkwardness, but I don't think I was being rude or was in the wrong here. Regardless, I want to know your opinion, so please let me know. ",

      "scenario_description": "My best friend (35f) and I (35f) have been good friends for a long time. In February of 2025 I asked her if she wanted to go on vacation someplace. She agreed, and I started looking - and found a caribbean cruise for $1500 after deposits and such. She agreed, and we stated that we would do 50/50 on everything.\n\nWhen I call to talk about the cruise, she doesn’t really seem excited to do it - nor do I feel like she is putting effort to get things together for the vacation. \n\nThe final payment date was May 14, 2025 - for the August 2025 sailing. I paid for the entire cruise because I wanted to pay it off. She told me she would pay me back for the cruise fare - but said she can’t right now due to financial stresses and being behind on bills. I assured her that we could accommodate things and she can pay for certain aspects that equal that of the cruise fare. She agreed. \n\nWe are both living on our own, so in the sense we probably have the same amount of expenses to pay. \n\n This past week has really stressed me out because check-in for the cruise was today (July 8) and she does not have a passport or real ID. It is far too late to do a passport and who knows what the actual wait time is for a real ID considering people are traveling a lot and with the May 7 change for domestic flights. \n\nOn top of this, we have been planning to purchase things for the cruise for a while, but I don’t want to be the only one paying for things considering she owed me $920 for the cruise fare. \n\nI was talking to my mom because I wanted advice and she told me that she would go with me on this cruise - and she would pay for things toward cruise that equaled the cruise fare since it was already paid. It got me really thinking that maybe I should plan one when my friend is more financially available. \n\nMy friend would not be able to pay for flights - which is important but even if she could - waiting for her new ID would stress me out bc she might not be able to board either way. \n\nAITA for taking my friend off the reservation and take my mom instead. I talked to her and told her I could cancel but I would lose even MORE money with the cancellation fee. She told me she would do a weekend on the town somewhere else. I feel really bad since we have planned this for a while, but I also don’t want to be overwhelmed or stressed having to pay her half of things along with my bills. ",

      "scenario_description": "My friend's wedding is near the end of this year and she wants me to be her man of honor. I am considering not going.\n\nWe met in undergrad and have been friends for 4 years. In school, we hung out almost every day. After undergrad, she moved back to her hometown on the other side of the country and returned to her old job. I started grad school and a new job. We have both been busy and don't talk often.\n\nWhenever I talk to her in person or voice chat, she is warm and excited to talk to me. Getting to that point is a problem because she is SO disorganized. When we make plans, she's either late or doesn't show up. When I text to ask where she is, she takes an hour+ to reply. More than once, she drove all the way to my city to see family and didn't tell me until she was already here. Once she said she would be in town next week and then didn't reply to my message for 5 days. I had to contact her partner to tell her to reply. My spouse and I visited them last year, but it feels like every time they're here, it's because they're seeing family and we just happen to be in the area.\n\nThe last time we talked, she suggested playing a game at 7pm. I said I'd be there. I waited an hour and asked if she was still going to be on. She got on 2 hours late, no apology or excuse.\n\nShe is sometimes apologetic but hasn't gotten any better with punctuality. She says she's too busy to hang out but I also see her and her roommates online gaming together almost every night, playing games that I would join for if they asked.\n\nMy spouse and I visited last year and met her friends. At some point she said that she never had a best friend. My spouse pointed at me. She looked surprised and said \"but we haven't known each other that long\".\n\nShe asked me to be her \"man of honor\" for her wedding. I was surprised since we barely talked for the last year. I didn't think we were that close now, especially after the above conversation. I said I was flattered but might not be the best choice since I live far away and wouldn't be able to coordinate things from here. She said it wasn't a problem and I wouldn't have to organize anything.\n\nI still haven't heard any details about the wedding. It's in 3 months. She told me the date and venue when I asked, but hasn't sent out invites. I have no idea what the plan is or if she even has a plan.\n\nI have to take time off work, school, and my internship to make it to her wedding. I feel like the wedding has had less effort put into it than the effort required for me to be there. Mostly, I feel hurt and abandoned because I went through a lot this past year dealing with chronic pain, my spouse almost dying, and disentangling myself from narcissistic parents. We supported each other through a lot when she lived here, but now that we're long-distance she's MIA. She barely knows what's going on in my life and I don't know what's going on in hers. After putting in all this effort, I feel checked out  and want to move on.",

      "scenario_description": "I (21m) was hanging out with my closest friend group (5 guys total) I’ve had since high school when something odd happened. Suddenly, after years of using the word himself (and all of us regularly using it), one friend (D) was taken aback by another friend (N) saying the word “retarded.”\n\nHe made a big deal of it being a “slur” and shamed N for using it liberally. When N questioned this shift, D replied, “Why use a slur? It’s just not cool to say anymore.”\n\nFor context, we’ve been super close since freshman year of high school. Now, the summer before senior year of college, we’re still close but less so due to naturally attending different schools. We used to hang out every weekend—smoking weed, drinking beers, playing Super Smash Bros, DnD, etc. We’re not big “trash-talkers” either; growing up in a nice area with solid education instilled values of kindness and respect. We’re mostly just goofy nerds.\n\nThere’s an unspoken understanding that we’re generally left-wing. Growing up in progressive areas instilled these ideals. I’ve personally shifted slightly toward the center after finding my place in the world, but I remain a big proponent of basic human rights and equality. Same goes for everyone else in the group. When we made “edgy” jokes, it was always understood as satire—funny because it’s opposite of our real beliefs. For example, making Hitler jokes since 4 out of 5 of us are Jewish.\n\nNow, six years later, there’s a sudden shift in group vibe—not because N and I desperately need to say “oh that was retarded” during Smash, but because there’s now tension and authority in the group. D and another guy (R) are suddenly very anti-slur, while N and I (still quite left-wing in our beliefs) see no issue as long as these words aren’t used derogatorily. That just wouldn’t be cool. The last guy (J) seems neutral—probably doesn’t care about “slurs” and just wants to have fun.\n\nNo one even used “retard” specifically to be funny. Maybe in funny situations, sure, but it’s more synonymous with “stupid” than purely for shock value. The sudden contempt for this usage seems to give D and R an air of superiority, as if censoring these words makes them more mature. If it slips now, the vibe immediately feels off (though we avoid comments or lectures if lucky).\n\nAm I the asshole, or does D’s sudden judgment of “retard” stem more from conformist indulgence in censorship among modern leftists rather than a genuine push for good?\n\nI understand removing it from medical dictionaries since it’s antiquated. I’d never use it for someone with disabilities. But bringing woke rules into a chill night with the boys? Seems retarded.",

I have four children with my ex. She had a years long affair with a man while our kids were ages 3-10. She eventually filed for divorce. I was unaware of the affair until right before the divorce was finalized (I suspected but finally found proof). She had been going on trips with him and even going on dates with him and his kids and our kids (he was also married at the time). He divorced his wife just before we got our divorce. Two weeks after our divorce was finalized, she introduced him to our kids as her boyfriend. I ended up having to pay $2000 per month in alimony (for 5 years) and ultimately over $3000 per month in child support while only getting the kids 1/3 of the time. She refused to go 50/50. She just got married to him (it's been almost 5 years since our divorce so she was able to collect almost all of the alimony). But I will still have to pay her over $3000 a month for child support while she is living with her new husband in a house 3 times bigger than mine (I had to sell our family home and move into a condo at the time of our divorce. She came out of the divorce with cash in hand while I ended up around $80k in debt). Am I the asshole for thinking that I shouldn't have had to give her any financial support after the divorce and certainly shouldn't have to give her any now that she is married to her affair partner? Shouldn't he have been the one to take care of her all this time? Especially now that they are married?",

      "scenario_description": "This is a throwaway account because people I know know my real acct. I need a perspective on this outside of my family to know if I'm not treating this event with enough importance.\n\nSo my sister had the first baby of our family and we're all so happy about it, but she's also treating her kid like he should be the center of our universe. Examples being constantly spamming our group texts with photos of him, turning EVERY conversation to be about him, etc.  \nThis attitude is supported by her husband's parents and both of my parents. My sister and her husband are having a big birthday party in 3 weeks for his first birthday and expecting us to be a there.\n\nI begrudgingly bought tickets to fly for the event a month ago. I'm gonna be honest: While I LOVE my nephew, I was already kindof dreading the party even though I'm willing to go through with it just to show support. There are a LOT of jerks amongst my sister's friends and her husbands family (these will be the majority of the 50ish guests present). I also find giant celebrations for a baby who will not remember it to be obnoxious. I would much rather just send a gift and celebrate my nephew in a visit one-on-one vs. spend $$$ on a plane ticket for an event where I socially suffer and I don't even really get to have real quality time with my nephew.\n\nAnother thing is that now an important work engagement is coming up for that same week. I'm considering canceling my plane ticket because I don't see how I can make it work without losing out on an important opportunity with my career.  \nMy parents shamed me pretty hard when I mentioned my feelings on it to them privately *(\\*\\*\\*EDIT: \"feelings on it\" meaning that I can't make it happen due to work, NOT my frustration about treating nephew like he's center of the universe)*, and they said I needed to still go to this because it's a big deal for him to turn 1 year old. Like I get that it's a big deal for the grandparents to be there, but me? I just don't really see why it's so important. Please help me see the other side of this - am I being unreasonable if I don't go?\n\nFAQ Notes based on comments I'm getting:\n\n1. I love my nephew and am not jealous of him lol. I am struggling with every conversation getting hijacked into more variations of the same sentiments about what he's doing every second of the day. I want to hear what other family members have going on too and it feels exhausting to get inundated with so many similar/same pics and comments all day every day.\n2. My parents shamed me because they said the baby would \"miss\" me being there. I have not told my parents or sister that I find the nephew oversharing obnoxious. I am keeping that to myself and only shared that here because it's an honest part to the dynamics and personal frustrations.\n3. the plane tickets are roughly $400 and does not include food, transportation and accommodation. It's definitely a financial sting but not totally threatening. I don't need to take off work as I can do remotely but I would be missing out on an in-person opportunity back home which is the bigger sting.\n4. I have met the baby 4 times now and will continue to make lots of efforts to see him if that matters.",

My mom, brother, grandma,aunts, and most of my cousins agreed with me while everyone else brushed it off like Maya had. Then Maya came up to me and said \" Can you stop bringing everyone in to this stupid fight between us?\" I had just had about enough so I looked her straight in the eye and said \"No.\" Now Maya is trying to mess my life up in every way she can but, I have to know AITA?",

My one roommate, we will call her Kayla, has people over pretty frequently, and she also watches people’s dogs a lot. Any time she has someone over, and they have a dog, she always lets them bring the dog to our house and has never asked us about it. Kayla also brings over the dogs that she dog sits and brings them to our house whenever. My other roommate, we’ll call her Carmen, doesn’t seem bothered as she has a huge dog. The main reason I have an issue with it is because I have a cat who is skeptical of dogs and is already trying to get used to the dogs he lives with, and if random ones are coming in the house it’s even more confusing and scary for him. Secondly, if a dog that is not on my lease ruins or damages something in my house I’m going to be upset about it in relation to the security deposit return. So am I the asshole if I say something to my roommate about it? ",

      "scenario_description": "So a family moved in around 6 months ago and seem quite nice. They have 2 kids, we have a 9 year old son. Kids, man and woman always say hello and very polite. They said when they settle they would like to invite us round for dinner (hasn’t happened but kind to say.) We know their names and say hello in passing and I’ve even sent his CV/resume to my workplace when he was looking for work. So yesterday he knocks round and says could we discuss childcare options with each other as we as parents all work and may need extra help so we may need them to have our son occasionally and we could have their children round. We are both full time workers but incredibly organised so have all childcare booked and planned until October. I felt I wanted to be neighbourly and say yes of course BUT also hesitant as I dont want to be saddled with kids I barely know all the time and know for sure we simply dont need extra help. Should I have given it more time before I said “thats kind of you to consider us but we are genuinely ok! Thanks!” Feel like I may have dismissed him? AITA???",

The more confident you are inside, the more others will see you  as such.  (It only took me 50 some years to figure this out).\n\nAttractiveness to everyone is different.  My husband likes curvy women.  Yeah for me.  Some do not.  Some like chubby.  Some like thin.  Some like athletic.  Some like blonds.  Yadda, yadda.  Does not matter, age, gender, identity, what ever.  Everyone has their own preferences.   Just as your daughter probably has an idea of what she likes.  \n\nThat is how I would approach this insecurity right now  And she is not the only one who feels this way.  We all think we are the only ones.  I look back now, and I think they \"pretty/popular\" girls probably felt the same way I did, only I could not see that back then.  We were teenagers  We all got up in the morning, looked in the mirror and did not like what we saw.  Or thought, that if only I had this or that, I would look so much better.  \n\nLearn to love yourself.  You will not always like yourself, but learn to love the parts of you that you cannot change.  (like a mole, a crooked nose, a big butt, chicken legs, etc.)   And if there is something you can change, then work on that.  Eat healthy for your age and body type/weight, exercise, drink water.   But, do not go strong and heavy.  You do not want to hurt your body as you are growing.  Do not stop eating your favorite foods.  Just eat in moderation.  Do not feel guilty if you over indulge here and there.  There is always tomorrow.  \n\nThe teenage years are so hard to navigate as a parent.  We have been there and done that, but our kids think we have not.  I wonder where they think we grew from?",

I had my baby shower last weekend and it was a great event, but there was one interaction that I may be the asshole for.  \n\nMy husband showed up for the gift portion.  When opening gifts, one gift was a baby care package and a onesie to the rival college my husband and I went to. It was given to us by a friend who went to said rival college.   My Husband has a pretty deep hatred of the rival school. I follow along with that since fall saturdays at football games is our thing.    \n\nWhen we opened this gift, my husband audibly said \"oh\". I could see the \"what the fuck \" look on his face.   I said, I hope a gift receipt came with this!  I thought it was a gag gift.  My friend says \"oh no gift receipt\".  I was like, oh well, \"Sons Name\" is never going to wear this. Then moved on to the next gift.  Little awkward, but whatever.  After the party, my husband threw the onesie in the trash.  \n\nA few days ago someone asked what happened with the onesie and I told them.  Well that made it around to a few people and I get a text from the friend saying that i'm a huge asshole.  I should have just given it back to her.  I was like thats what the gift receipt comment was for and told her my husband would never allow our son to be dressed like that.  I never thought it was supposed to be a legitimate gift, but apparently it was.  AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (29F) co-own a home with my mom and sister. I live in the basement, which has been my private space. Today, my mom told me that my cousin from overseas (who I barely know) and her two young kids are coming to stay with us for the entire summer, and that they'll be staying in the basement with me in the spare room. I'I protested and she called me selfish. I don’t even know the names of my cousins kids at all, and I value my personal space and quiet. I also work night shifts so when I come home in the morning to sleep I don’t want to be disturbed with any noise. \n\nAlso, my mom and sister are going on a 10-day cruise next month, and I was really looking forward to having the house to myself for once. My family can be pretty overbearing. When I brought this up, my mom just said, *“Well, now you won’t be home alone!”* like that was a good thing. I told her she made this decision without considering me at all and that I don’t plan to host or entertain anyone while they’re gone.\n\nFor added context: the last time a cousin stayed with us from overseas, my mom pressured me into giving her money so she could shop. I’m afraid that history will repeat itself, but 3x as much since she's bringing her kids too.\n\nAt this point, I’m so upset I’m seriously considering going to a hotel for those 10 days just to have peace. It feels like my space and comfort were completely disregarded and I don't want to give up my personal space.  AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT 1: My basement space is fully open to the upstairs there’s no door, just a staircase. So it’s not like I can lock anything or really block off my space, plus the laundry room is in the basement which everyone needs access to. \n\n  \nEDIT 2: Yes, I legally co-own the home. My name is on the title and the deed. I live in the basement, which has its own living area and bathroom. There are two rooms down there, mine and a spare room that my brother uses when he visits like once a month, but he only stays for a weekend when he comes. \n\nThat spare room is the one my mom is giving to my cousins. They won’t be in my actual bedroom, but since the basement is open with no door separating it from the rest of the house, I’ll basically be sharing my entire living area with people I don’t know all summer.\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "So I (25F) work as a temp at my city's parking authority office, selling parking permits to people. Not really relevant but I thought people might be curious. I also have IBS, which is actually relevant. So TMI warning, I guess, but everybody poops. So I have to use the bathroom a couple of times a day, and yes, it's number 2. I come into work a half an hour early just so I can guarantee I get fifteen minutes before I'm on the clock. I then spend half of my lunch break, which is only thirty minutes, in the bathroom, and usually go again about two hours before clocking in. Now, mind you, only two of these bathroom breaks are on the clock.\n\nI can't afford to be precious about where I use the bathroom. If I were the kind of person who could only use my own bathroom at home, I would also be pooping myself in public a lot (SPOILERS: I DO NOT POOP MYSELF IN PUBLIC). Well, the other day a coworker of mine noticed how often I use the bathroom, and how long I spend in there, and put two and two together that I'm going number two. Not that it's anyone's business, but she came up to me and told me it was gross to be pooping at work.\n\nThis isn't about taking too long, or using one of a limited number of stalls. There’s five individual bathrooms (one designated for men, one designated for women, three gender neutral) and usually no more than two at a time are occupied. So my using the bathroom barely affects anyone else except for the five to fifteen minutes total I spend in the bathroom during the work day. I also have coworkers who spend an extra twenty minutes on their lunch breaks and take frequent smoke breaks throughout the day, but because I happen to be performing a natural bodily function, I’m the gross one.\n\nI fully discounted this lady until he mentioned it to two other coworkers who were both equally judgy. I felt relatively comfortable in the stance that it’s normal to poop in bathrooms but now it’s three to one and I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t know if it’s a generational thing (everyone else is at least 40? Does that matter at all?) but I need to know: whether or not you personally feel comfortable pooping in public restrooms, does it make me a nasty freak because I do?",

      "scenario_description": "My son (8) and I (40f) flew home for the school holidays. I would have been content not to see my brother and his family, but I agreed to spend the weekend with them as my son and mum enjoy spending time with them. My nephew (6) had been unwell overnight. I questioned how sick he was and whether we should be going. I didn't want us get sick for our own sake, but also because he wouldn't be able to see his ore family. Mum was annoyed but spoke to my brother, who said nephew was fine, they were just tired after a rough night, we should still come. Mum and I were going to look after all the kids on Saturday night while my brother and his wife went to a party...probably why he was so keen for us to come; they  hadn't factored us into their weekend otherwise. My hesitation was met with an icy demeanour from mum so I agreed to go, lest the rest of our trip be ruined by her mood. When we arrived it was clear my nephew was still quite unwell. He was on the lounge with a sick bucket. My brother even remarked, \"yeah, he's really unwell\". Turns out he'd been vomiting overnight with a fever. My mother made it clear through her demeanour and tone that I was meant to pretend all was fine. I was too furious and uncomfortable to do that. Similar scenarios have happened before, resulting in my son, husband, and I  becoming quite unwell. My brother then left with the kids to pick his daughter (9) up from her first birthday party of the day. I told my mum it was really disrespectful that they'd done this again, and that I was absolutely furious. I could have been more calm and more diplomatic, but the gaslighting and denial of my right to be and express upset was too much. I asked for their street address so I could book a taxi home for me and my son. She insisted that she would leave too, although she eventually agreed that I could drive her car back if my brother could drive her home on the Sunday. He couldn't do that as he and his wife had too many plans, notwithstanding our visit. So we all left and the rest of our stay with her (2 days) was either silent treatment or ice cold responses. I tried to talk to her about how hurtful it was to be treated like that, which only made it worse.  I told her we won't be coming back for a while and, although I didn't say this, I've decided we'll stay in a hotel when we do return. ",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nFirst, I love my in-laws. Love them. I've been married for nearly two decades to an Iowan. We regularly visit the state for holidays and simply family visits. But they're not exactly tech savvy. \n\nI do the bulk of the driving. And close-in to their home, they certainly know the area better than I ever will and better than the GPS.  And I'd never challenge their directions in their area. \n\nTHE ISSUE: But once we go beyond their hometown (and in rural Iowa, it's quite normal to drive 30-50 miles to grab coffee, shop, dine, etc.) they have their known routes on getting places... That definitely aren't the fastest or best. Lots of gravel road driving, for example. \n\nOn the GPS, I can clearly see what they want me to do vs what the device is suggesting -- and how much faster it would be to take the suggested route. When I have tried to point out that the GPS is offering a faster option, they instantly dismiss it out of hand. I also have pointed out that GPS can tell them of road closures or slow downs and that's also dismissed as not needed (and when we have encountered a closed road, I've never said anything and their only acknowledgement is to laugh and say that maybe GPS knew and continue on).\n\nRecently, I was driving, had the GPS on and could see that the difference between their preferred route and the suggested route was 12 minutes. I took the faster route, politely feigning that I didn't hear them in time. I could tell this irked them. But I was just done with sticking to what they knew only.\n\nWhat irks me is that they DO use the GPS when they visit us (another state and much larger metro area). So they see the value of it, just not in their hometown state.",

I think I would lose my mind If I had to add homeschooling to my plate. Am I wrong for telling him I need that break each day away from the kids?\n\nEDIT: to answer any questions, he wants me to HS to avoid bad influence, but they have been going to school their entire school age lives, they have already been influenced, that ship sailed. \n\nI am 100% not qualified to teach, nor do I have the patience. When his daughter fell behind in math I would help her with homework, and even with all distractions off, she could not focus on the task and would bounce around, ask unrelated questions and not pay attention to what I am teaching. So I can imagine teaching her would be a nightmare for both of us. \n\nI get allowance each month plus bills paid, access to card and bank account, so our marriage outside of him bugging me about HS is great, he takes good care of us, but the fact that he’s asked so many times and I have told him that me teaching them would hurt their education and also our relationship plus the many other valid reasons and that still hasn’t deterred him makes me question if he truly sees everything I do and if it’s enough. I don’t want to be selfish, I would do anything for my kids and my family, but that also means putting my foot down on something that I know could be detrimental to them even if he doesn’t see it. ",

      "scenario_description": "For some reason this keeps happening to me where I find dogs on the side of the road. Thankfully, I have never been bitten or hurt but it stresses my parents out a lot. Recently this weekend, I was on my way to go antiquing and while on a road, there were two Amish drivers on either side of the road with a dog running between them.\n\nI thought that the dog was one of theirs just running alongside his owner but when I tried to pass to go around the horses and the dog, the dog darted out in front of me. I slowed back down and went behind the buggy again and saw the dog again dart in front of a car coming the opposite direction.\n\nFinally I shouted and asked the Amish guy if it was his dog and he said no so I got the dog in my car and took him to the nearest police station (they have microchip scanners there). From there he told me to take the dog to a humane society 30 minutes away as he was alone on duty and most likely the dog was Amish.\n\nMy parents told me I was an asshole because I should have left the dog alone and it would have found its way home eventually and now because the dog was nearly 45 minutes away they might not know to contact that shelter to find it. They said I essentially kidnapped this dog and he would never go back to his family.\n\nThe dog was also really scared when he went into the shelter and I feel bad that he's going to be potentially stuck in there a while alone. He was a very sweet boy and while in the car kept trying to snuggle, give kisses and loved lots of pets.\n\nHe had no collar on and it was about 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33.3 Celsius) and again he was running in traffic so I wanted to make sure he was safe but now I'm worried I should done more to find his owners ASAP.\n\nI did put some flyers in mailboxes along the road but I still feel guilty over the fact I may have potentially separated this dog from this family forever.",

      "scenario_description": "I recently got married, and since then, I’ve been concerned about the living situation with my husband’s family. My husband (28M) is a master’s degree student and has been unemployed because his father wouldn’t let him find jobs outside the city. He was living with his cousin’s family inside his own house because his family wants someone to take care of him.\n\nThe cousin’s husband is working, but my husband is the one paying all the household bills. From electricity to internet, using money that actually comes from his father. Although they live there supposedly to take care of him, the cousin didn’t actually look after him or offered him food when she dined with her family. Her husband smokes a lot, and their children made much noises when my husband was doing his thesis.\n\nBecause we’re now married, I feel it’s unfair that my husband is supporting a family where the husband is working, especially since this impacts our future together.\n\nI asked my husband to confront his father and stop paying the bills for his cousin’s family, and to ask them to move out of the house now that we’re married. This might make me the asshole because I’m interfering in his family matters and pressuring him to take a difficult stand, which could cause tension or conflict within his family. I’m worried that by pushing this, I might be seen as disrespectful or insensitive to their family dynamics.\n\nAITA here? How should my husband tell his father to stop paying for their bills and ask them to leave the house, now that he’s married to me?\n\nUpdate: His father is kinda rich but conservative and restraining. That's why my husband wasn't allowed to work outside the city and live alone. His father has properties registered under his children's name. He also gives my husband monthly allowance and paid for the tuition fee. But some of my husband's allowance goes to pay the cousin's household bill.   \n  \nMy husband is currently living with me in my apartment. The house is supposed to be rented out since he no longer lives there. The rent from the house should help support his living expenses.",

      "scenario_description": "My (30s M) friend (30s M) and I planned a beach trip to Florida about two months ago. It's a 3.5-hour drive, and we booked an Airbnb together. The plan was for a relaxed \"boys trip\" getaway.\n\nAbout a month ago, he casually mentioned that his ex-girlfriend (who he broke up with about 3 months ago) would coincidentally be in the same beach town that weekend. We both joked about it, referencing \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" and imagining awkward waves if we even saw them. I definitely got the impression that we weren't planning on interacting with her.\n\nFast forward to this past Sunday (five days before the trip, which starts Friday night). He tells me he's now planning to go out to dinner with his ex-girlfriend and her family on Saturday night. This is a big deal because we're arriving Friday at 9:30 PM, so Saturday is our only full night on the trip.\n\nHe asked if I wanted to come along to this dinner. I was pretty taken aback. I told him I thought this was supposed to be a boys trip for us, and I wasn't cool with being essentially ditched for our main night there. I then said that if his priority was seeing his ex, then I didn't really want to go on the trip anymore.\n\nHe immediately got confrontational, accusing me of \"blowing up the trip\" and \"making a huge deal out of nothing.\"\n\nTo me, this feels like he's clearly choosing his ex-girlfriend over our planned time, especially since this trip was specifically for us to hang out. I considered us best friends.\n\nAITA for considering backing out of the trip because he wants to spend our only full night with his ex-girlfriend and her family?",

When I do try drinking water I physically wretch due to the anxiety it gives me trying to drink it. So I stay hydrated by drinking diluted cordial.\n\nWhen I met my current partner (34M, let's call him Jim) I was drinking 30% cordial 70% water, which I admit now was strong.\nAbout 6 months into my relationship with Jim, he confessed he didn't like me drinking the juice because it made my breath smell bad (of the juice), it stopped me trying new foods and it stopped us from travelling cheap because we would have to pay for baggage just so I can take the juice on holiday. He even compared it to an addiction and how he was able to quit smoking so I can quit this. \n\nWe decided to compromise and 1 year later I had reduced it down to 5% cordial. I was able to take my juice in mini aeroplane bottles and I had to admit I was tasting food better.\n\nHowever Jim was still not happy and we keep getting into fights about how 'disgusting' it is and it is putting him off wanting to kiss me. I can't even have other fruit flavoured drinks because Jim says it smells and tastes too similar.\n\nSo I tried to give it up for him. It has been a month of attempting to drink sugar water. I am getting panic attacks and dehydrated because I'm not drinking enough. I am considering going back to the cordial because of this but I am worried I'd be letting myself and Jim down.\n\nAITA for wanting to drink fruit juice or do I need to keep pushing?\n\nUpdate:\nI have seen a few people not understand what I mean by 'cordial' in the UK it is concentrated fruit juice that is diluted with water- it is not alcohol.\nAlso the juice 'smells' to Jim because of the artificial sugar that's usually put into cordial.\nAs for the situation, I know it seems like a strange situation to many of you, my parents were soft and let me have whatever I wanted- which has come to bite me in the ass.\nI realise I have some psychological issues regarding water, I know it is not normal to wretch at water.\nA lot of you have said I should dump 'jim' but I feel like I shouldn't until I have dealt with this issue. I talked to him about how much anxiety this has been causing me and my craving to go back to the juice. \nWe ended up agreeing that we will go to a doctor together and he wants to support me getting used to water, even if it means going back to juice for while. \nI don't want to throw away a relationship with Jim, just because of my weird psychological problem.\nThank you everyone for your messages.",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for refusing to help my sister with her baby every day after work?\n\nI (21F) work full-time, every day except Sundays. My sister (36F) recently had a baby, who is now five months old. I love my nephew and visit them whenever I can after work, but it’s usually a long trip and I get home around 9 p.m. when I go there.\n\nI live with my mom, and she doesn’t like me taking showers after 9 p.m. because of the noise. Even though I pay the water and electric bills, I try to avoid fights and respect that.\n\nMy sister just returned from maternity leave and asked me to come help with the baby every day after work so she can shower and get things done. I told her that it’s difficult for me because of how late I get home and the problems it causes at home. I also mentioned that I’m usually exhausted after work and that going there daily would be too much.\n\nShe said it was fine, but then got really upset and started yelling at me. She brought up personal things, saying I can’t keep a job and making me feel like I’m unreliable. I was just trying to explain my situation, but she seemed to take it as an attack.\n\nNow I don’t feel comfortable going to her house anymore, even though I care about her and the baby. She has a husband and in-laws who could help her too, so I don’t feel like it’s fair for her to expect this much from me.\n\nStill, I worry that my family will think I’m being selfish or uncaring.\nAITA?\n",

She does not need you to come every day to help take care of her child.  \n\nAnd if she does, or this reaction is not normal for her, then you need to ask her  if she should see a doctor, because she could be going thru post partum depression.

You just have your own life to live right now and it conflicts with hers and the distance to get to her home.",
