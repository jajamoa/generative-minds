      "scenario_description": "Me 16f and my sister 14f have a really close relationship but there is one major difference, she is stereotypically pretty. She has so many boys chasing after her and she loves it and plays into it. Me on the other hand I have never been asked out and never had anyone really have a crush on me so when my boy best friend said yes to dating me I was over the moon. However my sister was not, she likes my boyfriend as a friend and they had met a number of times but as soon as I started dating him she got so pissed. \n\nMultiple nights in a row she cried and screamed and me that it wasn’t fair because my bf is taking me away from her. I obviously thought that was stupid and I rolled my eyes at her and walked away. Also when I was on call with him she freaked out at me grabbed the phone and demanded that I break up with him. I again obviously said no.\n\nBut today is where I draw the line, I was texting my friend after going to the gym with my sister,and she said that her and my bf were free to hang out I was obviously very happy because I love him but her immediate reaction was to yell at me to not go. I called her out and said that she’s being unfair and that she hangs out with her friends all the time but she threw her half full bottle of water at me and stormed off back home. Am I the AH?",

      "scenario_description": "(Sorry if my grammar is a little off, I have automatic uppercase letters off.) \nI feel like an idiot writing this out, but I (17f) dated my ex (18m), who we’ll call Mark for anonymity’s sake, for around seven months from 2023-2024. We broke up over a year ago now, due to me having some really bad mental health struggles and starting to push him away (the breakup was on me, i can admit that, but he wasn’t perfect either.) A few weeks ago, he texted me telling me he missed me. To be perfectly honest, I haven’t missed him, so i didn’t say it back. What I did tell him was that i am still struggling mentally, and in no certain terms that we would only have the same issues if we got back together. \n\nToday, his *girlfriend* texted me on instagram. She basically said that any girl should let another know if their boyfriend is messing them around. My heart fucking dropped. I had literally no idea that this guy had a new girlfriend, i don’t follow his instagram, and i had forgotten that I even had his snapchat. Immediately, I told her i was sorry and i had no idea they were together. We talked for around ten-fifteen minutes, I sent her screenshots of the conversation “Mark” and I had, and gave her the timeline of when they took place. Afterwards, I apologised profusely again, and blocked him on everything. My friends are saying it’s not on me, but i feel like a bitch. If I had any idea whatsoever that she even existed, I would’ve told her, but I never thought he was the type of guy to even do something like that. (Though I maybe should’ve seen it coming, given that when we were together he downloaded Wizz, and I found out through a friend- I still have no confirmation if I was actually cheated on or not.) \n\nI know she must be hurting right now, and I have no idea if she plans to breakup with him or whatever. I’ve been cheated on, I know that pain, and the thought of causing it is making my head physically hurt. \n\nI know a lot of people won’t take this seriously because it’s ‘petty teenage relationship drama’, but I’m kind of reeling about this. Also, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on? This app kind of confuses me. Anyways, please give me your brutal honesty, do I suck? ",

      "scenario_description": "I (18F) live at home and split time between my divorced parents — about 3 weeks with each. Lately, my mom and I have been getting into frequent small arguments, and I’m starting to feel overwhelmed.\n\nWe’ve always clashed a bit. My mom can be really controlling: she wants to know every detail when I go out, constantly reminds me about things I already do (like flossing), and is really strict about money. When I had a children's bank account, she would literally check it daily and question me about any spending. She has a decent income, owns a nice apartment, and her parents (my grandparents) are wealthy, so I don’t fully understand why she’s so stressed about money all the time.\n\nOne recurring fight is over how long I shower. I wash my hair twice a week, which takes me around 25–30 minutes total. I even turn the water off while conditioner or a hair mask is sitting — a habit I actually learned from her! Still, she knocks on the door to complain, saying I take too long. Today it happened again, and we got into another fight. She thinks 2-minute showers (sometimes even without soap!) are fine, and worries about the water bill.\n\nI’ve told her that I’m not being wasteful and that I literally can’t shower faster given my routine. When I bring up how she’s being too controlling, she gets defensive and says she’s just being a normal parent. I’ve also told her that I’d rather live more with my dad since he’s much more relaxed and not so critical — but I can tell that hurts her feelings. She gets sad when I say stuff like that, and I don’t want to upset her, but I also feel like I have a right to speak up since I spend so much time living with her.\n\nSo... AITA for calling her controlling and saying I’d rather live with my dad?",

That's really been taunting me cause we've come far from what we used to be and I've just been saying it's not enough since i started comparing, I just hope I'm not greedy just determined.\n\nI just want to add now that i dont care about physical stuff just fitting in, and I understand that IATA, I'll apologize to my mom and work hard when i start to support her but i just hope these ambitions arent wrong and greedy.

      "scenario_description": "My ex and I were in the middle of breaking up amicably on good terms until he asked for his jewellery that he had bought me as a present back. I refused to give it back as he gave it as a gift. During the relationship I gifted him many items for his birthday and other occasions which costed more than the jewellery he was asking for back, except I never asked for those things back because I had gave them to him as a gift, a present, because I loved him at the time and wanted to give them to him. I had gotten him an expensive watch for his birthday and he offered to give it back the first time we broke up, I decided to take it back because it was brand new and had not been altered to fit him yet, to him the watch was something that he did not deserve if we were not together, due to hi giving the watch back previously, this then prompted him to ask me to give the watch back if im deciding to keep my jewellery, I said no. I said no because we were breaking up and I no longer have the sentiment towards him to give the watch back. Am I wrong in this situation?\n\nHe said he wanted it back because he sacrificed lots of time and money and picked up extra shifts to get the money for the jewellery, however, I took offence to this because I had also spent time and money picking out his gifts. I asked if he was reselling the jewellery and he said no, I then asked if he was regifting and he said no, I'm well aware he could have just been lying with those answers. I then asked him why would he want something in his room that reminds me of him and he went quiet. By the end of it he was asking for just one of them back and i still said no, so a part of me thinks he could have just wanted it for the sentimental value but I am still not sure.\n\nMy reasoning for keeping the jewellery was because he had gifted me the items, I still had sentimental value towards the items and was quite attatched to them as they represented an important time in my life, a souvenir per say. By giving it back, to me that would seem like the gifts were on loan and I was merely borrowing them.\n\nEDIT: For some backstory we broke up 4 times during our relationship and he had given the watch back after the first breakup on his own accord, telling me he was giving it back no matter what, I had no say in this matter as he did not want to keep it, hence why I accepted the gift back. The jewellery he asked for was after our 4th and final separation. The cost of the watch was irrelevant as we were in different financial situations and keep in mind it was unworn and unused, the jewellery however I had worn everyday since i was gifted it. The jewellery was a bracelet and necklace, no conditional items like a ring.",

My sister (36F) recently had a baby, who is now five months old. I love my nephew and visit them whenever I can after work, but it’s usually a long trip and I get home around 9 p.m. when I go there.\n\nI live with my mom, and she doesn’t like me taking showers after 9 p.m. because of the noise. Even though I pay the water and electric bills, I try to avoid fights and respect that.\n\nMy sister just returned from maternity leave and asked me to come help with the baby every day after work so she can shower and get things done. I told her that it’s difficult for me because of how late I get home and the problems it causes at home. I also mentioned that I’m usually exhausted after work and that going there daily would be too much.\n\nShe said it was fine, but then got really upset and started yelling at me. She brought up personal things, saying I can’t keep a job and making me feel like I’m unreliable. I was just trying to explain my situation, but she seemed to take it as an attack.\n\nNow I don’t feel comfortable going to her house anymore, even though I care about her and the baby. She has a husband and in-laws who could help her too, so I don’t feel like it’s fair for her to expect this much from me.\n\nStill, I worry that my family will think I’m being selfish or uncaring.\nAITA?\n",

      "scenario_description": "When I was younger and still lived at home, my family would have an account on each streaming service with all of our separate profiles. \n\nMy dad would often change the passwords to them just for safety as it’s recommended you should change your passwords to things every few times. But when he would do this, he wouldn’t give me the password and when I would ask he would say things like “well are you going to pay for it?”. He would say things like this as a joke and then eventually give in but that wouldn’t be for a while. Eventually I got sick of this and decided I’ll just create and pay for my own account to save the hassle. \n\nThis is specific to my Disney + account. I’ve had this account that I created for years now and I have been moved out of home for about 2 years so I’ve had my own streaming accounts.\n\nNow fast forward to now. I must have logged in to my Disney + account at my parents house to watch something with them and forgot to log out so they’ve been using my account ever since and only told me until now. \n\nI was a bit annoyed that they’ve been using my account without telling me especially when I don’t feel very independent if we’re all just sharing streaming services together (is that weird? Idk). \n\nI was over at my parents house and dad was watching a documentary on my Disney + account. When I logged into my Disney + account, I saw that it had been logged in from multiple areas that I have never been nor my parents have been so for the account’s safety, I logged out and changed the password because who knows who’s logging in to my account. This then stopped the documentary my dad was watching and logged him out too. Before I was able to tell him sorry I’ve just changed my password because of all these unknown logins, he has this huge meltdown because he thinks I did it out of spite and that it’s “unfair”. But it’s my account and I pay for it…… \n\nWhen I told him that I was thinking of deleting my account cause I barely use it and it’s another expense I don’t need, he has even more of a meltdown and again says “that’s so unfair, we do so much for you”.\nAm I in the wrong here? This argument just seems so dumb over a stupid Disney + account.",

But as I’m sitting here signing up for classes, the only thing running through my head is my dad’s words from both times I graduated, “I’m not proud of you because it was expected.”\n\nNow I don’t need my parent’s approval for anything. But I’m working myself up I think way more than I need to over this. My dad also has some mental health issues and generational trauma that he’s working through so I’m not sure what he meant when he said that or how he would respond to me telling him how I’m feeling?

I apologized and she snapped at me saying “you’re standing like an inch away” and I’m like “it’s just really crowded”. \n\nThere was never any physical contact in any way.\n\nAs time went on it got even more packed and there were some people crowding me too, I just held my tongue as I feel that’s the reality at a concert like this when you want to get close to the band.\n\nWhen I looked over midway through the show I noticed these two girls had left the area completely.\n\nEveryone else around me seemed chatty and excited to see the show.\n\nAITA for standing too close to this one young girl?",

My husband is Jewish and I raised our children to be very in touch with their cultural identity (sent them to Jewish schools and sleepaway camps) but don’t really practice the religion in terms of keeping the Sabbath, following the dietary laws, etc.\n\nOur son is 19 and has, over the past two years, become pretty religious. He spends the Sabbath with friends, which is fine with us. We have tried to compromise on the dietary laws by purchasing kosher meat/poultry for him, not mixing meat and dairy, etc. we live in an area with a large Jewish community and he has cart blanche to use Apple Pay to buy himself whatever food he wants. \n\nBecause I grew up in the community I know the rules and do the best I can for him while not limiting myself to a culture that I chose to leave.\n\nI recently found out from one of my other kids that he is annoyed that we haven’t converted one of our ovens (we have two) into a kosher oven for his use, or purchased separate dishes for him etc.\n\nSibling was like “Did you ask Mom and Dad to do any of this?”\n\nSon was like “no, mom grew up with all of this so she definitely knows what I need and is choosing not to do it.”\n\nSibling pointed out he can’t be mad if he doesn’t ask while ALSO pointing out that Son is 19 and that this is our house and if he’s that pressed he can get his own place and do what he wants.\n\nFact is, I don’t want to. I cook and bake a lot. I like having two ovens. I don’t want to relive the exhaustion of a kosher (semi-kosher) kitchen, though I could.\n\nAITA for not accommodating my son’s religious beliefs to the best of my ability rather than a baseline level?",

But, both of our immediate bosses are gone, and I was appointed authority over them. Of course I’m not going to have some iron fist all of the sudden. In fact, the only thing that’s changed is I have some more important responsibilities now. But my friend absolutely does not work unless he is being stared at. He’s taking every chance he gets to do nothing. This wouldn’t bother me so much if our jobs weren’t all manual labor. What I mean is everything that he doesn’t do, my other friend and I have to. We’re both fed up. We all work 12 hour days 2 weeks at a time living a short plane ride away from our homes. So there’s no escaping this. \n\nEarlier today, a few hours into our shift, he slowly walked over to me and just stared into my eyes. He does this sometimes when he’s bored. I asked him what’s up, and he just replied “not much”. I asked him how much he’s got done since I left and he didn’t even have a response for me. All I got was a bunch of excuses as to why nothing actually got done. So I finally told him to stop being so lazy and just get stuff done. Now he won’t talk to me at all.\n\nI’m not a very good story teller I’ve decided as I’m reading this over, so I’m sorry.\n\nTLDR;\n\nFriend wouldn’t do his job, forcing me and my friend to do it for him while he gets paid. I finally snap and tell him to stop being so lazy and now I’m getting the silent treatment. AITA?\n\nI would love to give more context if any questions arise.",

      "scenario_description": "I live in a state that gets cold winters and hot, humid summers. I have never been lucky enough to live somewhere with central AC and my current house is no different. It gets very very hot. The only rooms with air conditioning are the bedrooms, one is for sleeping and the other is an office. We have lived here for 4 years now. \n\nEvery summer I have the same problem, it gets too hot for me to cook. Right now, my kitchen is 85°f (~29.5c) In the past summers, it gets up to 90°f (32c). It is so hot that when I cook, even quick meals like spaghetti, I overheat. I get dizzy, my head hurts, I feel weak. It is awful. My husband knows about this. \n\nI finally got fed up. After another episode of overheating while cooking, I broke down and ordered an air conditioner for the kitchen. It’s small and cheap, about $200 and it will keep the kitchen cool. My plan is to use it when I am cooking or cleaning in the kitchen. \n\nMy husband wasn’t home when I ordered it and I honestly forgot to tell him I ordered it until it arrived 2 days later. He saw me bring it inside and asked what it was and I told him it was an air conditioner for the kitchen. \n\nHe is mad that I didn’t consult him before buying it. That is true, I didn’t. And I forgot to tell him I did. He told me it was a waste of money, too expensive to run, and I can just use a fan when I cook or just not cook at all. He wanted me to return it. \n\nI don’t want to go the whole summer never being able to cook because the kitchen won’t cool off. I also paid for it with my own money, I don’t expect him to split the cost with me, and I pay the electric bill! I can afford the added cost of running it a few times per week to cool down the kitchen so I can cook without getting sick. \n\nI didn’t return it like he wanted and I installed the air conditioner myself and have used it twice since I got it, once to cook and once to do a deep clean in the kitchen. When it’s been on, he scoffs and rolls his eyes and acts all passive aggressive because he thinks it was a waste of money and frivolous spending. \n\nSo AITA for buying an air conditioner without consulting my husband?",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for refusing to move back in with my dad even though he says he’s “not responsible for me anymore” if I don’t?\n\nI (19F) grew up in a very unstable household. My parents were constantly on and off — like a cycle. My dad would go out partying, drink, go to bars, and come home in awful states. My mom would leave him, and somehow he would always manipulate her into coming back with promises of change. But he never changed. The cycle repeated over and over and over.\n\nI was the quiet kid growing up. I never really got into arguments with my dad like my mom and sibling did. I was always just in my room, observing everything from the sidelines, trying to stay invisible and out of the way. But even as a bystander, I was affected. Watching that kind of instability messes with you, even if you’re not the direct target.\n\nRight now, the cycle is happening again. My dad is trying to convince my mom to come back — and she’s agreeing to. But I’ve told them both that I don’t want to go back and live with him. I’m hurt. I’m scared of him. And I don’t feel emotionally safe in that space.\n\nHere’s where things get messed up:\nMy dad sat me down and gave me an ultimatum. Either I come back to live with him, or he’s “no longer responsible for me.” So I told him I’m not moving back in, but I’m willing to come by and stay some nights just to keep the peace. That was my compromise.\n\nNow he’s blaming my mom, saying she’s the reason we all left him and that we don’t have a relationship. But that’s just not true. He never takes accountability for the things he did. And even now, he still sees me as a child who should obey him — not someone with valid pain and reasons.\n\nI feel so conflicted.\nOn one hand, I know I’m protecting myself.\nBut on the other hand, I’m being made to feel like I’m the problem — like I’m being cold, or disrespectful, or tearing the family apart.\n\nSo Reddit…\nAITA for refusing to move back in with my dad, even if it causes drama and he cuts me off?\nWas agreeing to sleep there occasionally just enabling the cycle again?\n\nI genuinely don’t know. I just feel tired and stuck.\n\nPS:my brother is 20 and also doesn't see himself living there again.\n",

      "scenario_description": "I got home from working a 12-hour shift. When I pulled up, I saw my husband and his friend cleaning out our basement. I thought to myself, “They’re working hard, so I’ll just go ahead and put the kids in the shower and to bed since he’s busy and will probably be tired when he’s done.”\n\nAnyway, I put the kids in the shower and decided to start getting ready for bed myself. I began taking my makeup off with an oil cleanser. While I was doing this, he walked in and turned on the shower. I asked him to please turn the shower off so I could wash the oil off my face and cleanse properly. I only asked because when the shower is running, the sink water turns cold.\n\nWe’ve gotten into it many times before for this exact reason. Washing my face is something I take seriously. It’s part of my routine, it helps me unwind, and I actually enjoy it.\n\nBut when I asked him to turn off the shower so I could finish (because I literally had oil in my eyes) he went off. He said I was being inconsiderate, that he was cold (from sweating and coming inside), and that I should have just wiped the oil off my face and waited for him to finish showering.\n\nThat sent me over the edge. It feels like he always chooses to come into the bathroom to shower, shave, or wash his hands when I’m in there washing my face. I’ve told him so many times that the water gets cold when something else is running. Tonight he even said, “People cold plunge; that’s what you should have done.”\n\nSo…. AITA\n\nEdited to add…. The door does NOT lock. ",

      "scenario_description": "Hi,\n\nSad goodbye to my parents before I left. Everytime I hug my mum, I pull away when she tries to kiss me. It makes me really uncomfortable and she always assumes I'm ok with it, she pulls in and ALWAYS kisses me anyway. Makes me feel violated. I'm a 30 year old man and I can't so no without my mum calling me awkward and it is insinuated I am doing an absolutely awful thing. My dad towards the end was just like \"kiss your mum\". I understand both my parents were upset but why do my emotions not matter and if I do want to do something as it makes me uncomfortable both in a physical and a emotional. I cannot respect myself if I let someone so something to me that I am even not comfortable with myself.There emotions matter but mine don't. When there emotioms matter mine don't when my do they make it out that just putting my emotions first is trashing their emotional wellbeing\n\nI keep on feeling guilty and I feel like am I being made out to be cold hearted and heartless etc?\n\nFor frame reference I am autistic and sometimes, I find somethings a tad bit more overwhelming, well not that it matters compared to other people. I feel like for stating the fact maybe I deviate from the norm , I am made to feel guilty for it or I do. Everytime it occurs I feel like my own individual sense dissolve as I feel like I am just an extension of my parents will and what they want, and what is emotionally important for them not me.\n\nAlso I'll add. I have definetly been dealing with vunerable narricistic traits over the years. I could go on and on into so much detail but I put together on r/advice but generally, the TL;DR of that post is.\n\nI have no ability to connect with other humans due to a mal-aligned attachment style and I continually villianise myself due to low self esteem. I got diagnosed with Aspergers a few years ago and I am just unique and I didn't need the diagnosis and apparently, the change in my interaction i.e. not masking was all all i will repeat, down to the antidepressants I was on at the time and they spoke to the GP on my behalf saying I was manic and not myself, also they were emotionally distraught and emotionally black mailed me. My dad has this deep trauma from his past, his mum was in and out of psychiatric care but why should I take all this abuse. HIS MUM DID'NT let him ride his bike when he was young. He wouldnt let me do certain jobs into my 20's and both of them would be emotionally dismissive when I did something they didnt approve of i.e. like moving out. I have moved out now and i just spent a week at my uncles where my parents are atm the thing is this attachment style or trauma is still unresolved and still exists even though we dont have much contact. There is so many more details like i had a medical appointment yesterday and I didnt tell him or I would of been drilled for information.\n\nAITA for not kissing my mum after saying goodbye and farewell earlier?",

We are not financially stable enough to move in together yet so our current schedule is that I’ll spend every weekend from Friday night to Sunday night at his place together.\nAt home, i share a room with my sister (24F) and she is pretty emotionally unstable most of the time but recently it’s been made worse by the fact that 5 months ago she went through a break up. Now she needs a lot of attention and I spend every week night with her, going to the gym, watching tv together and going for target runs. So much so that I don’t have time to spend with my other siblings and recently she’s started to express anger over me spending the weekends with my boyfriend instead of staying with her. \nI’ve tried to reason with her and compromise by coming home to hang out on the Saturday mornings when he works but it’s never enough. \nWhen I bring the issue to my mom, she sides with my sister and says she needs me so I should stay home and that I’m being selfish. My sweet boyfriend wouldn’t mind if I did but as bad as it sounds, his place is the only place I can rest without everyone needing a piece of me. The only place I can be taken care of instead of taking care of everyone else.\nI don’t want to seem like I don’t care because I do but the guilt trips are taking a toll on me and I don’t know what to do. \nAm I the asshole?

      "scenario_description": "I’ll make this short. I, (15F) was invited to my father to hangout with him to a firing range. I’m okay with firing ranges, since dad always wanted me to become a police. (Which is not what I aspire to be), but today—I declined his offer. Dad said it costs 2000 php (which is 35 USD) for the bullets and gun which is offered by the place and it’s pretty legit—so he said we can use MY money because he’ll repay me soon anyways. Sure, it might be fun if I did want to go. But for some reason, I didn’t want to bond. I don’t know and I feel guilty for declining him. I just answered: “I don’t want to”, or “no.” When they (both my parents) said “Come on, dress up. Let’s go.” I feel like I’m being selfish and a killjoy. I couldn’t even reason why I didn’t want to go—I just didn’t feel like it. I felt overwhelmed having to explain why. **Why?** I don’t know. I can’t explain. I feel like I’m obligated to go. Because after all that talk and our small argument, my dad said: “From now on, I don’t want you saying no. It’s just bonding.” And my mom sided with him and said “yeah, it’s just bonding.” It didn’t help my case. Now, maybe I’m just genuinely lacking explanation why I was behaving like that. But, I genuinely did NOT want to go. You know that feeling when your friends want to hangout but for some reason you don’t want to? That’s how I felt. I had no reason or argument why. But I felt like I’m disappointing my parents with their daughter lacking cooperation and understanding that they just want to bond. \n\nSide note: ((Sorry for bad english and bad grammar. I just need to get this out.))",

      "post_title": "AITA for throwing out my friend’s couch after it sat in my garage for 3.5 years, even though I said she could only store it for two weeks?",
      "scenario_description": "In 2019, a friend asked if she could store a couch in my garage. It had belonged to her late father, and they were clearing out his house.\n\nI said no.\n\nMy garage is small. One car and barely any extra room. It isn’t insulated, it leaks, and squirrels basically have squatter rights. I don’t store anything there on purpose. I also told her that people always say they’ll “pick it up soon,” and then never do. Somehow the person doing the favor becomes the villain.\n\nShe kept pushing. I offered options:  \n– Rent a storage unit  \n– Get a U-Haul, take the couch home, and have her kids drive up and get her car  \n– Leave it at her dad’s and take the risk\n\nHer niece even borrowed a trailer to bring it to me. All that, just to keep it out of her siblings’ hands.\n\nI finally said yes, but I was crystal clear. Two weeks. After that, I could do whatever I wanted with it.  \nShe said absolutely. Her kids would be there that weekend to pick it up.\n\nThey never came.\n\nI called a few times that first year.  \n“Oh yeah, we’ll come get it.”  \nCrickets.  \nIn one of my “please get your couch” calls, she said, “I’m a Sagittarius. We’re not good at this stuff.”  \nI’m still not sure what that has to do with picking up your couch.\n\nI tried again in year two. Same story. After that, I gave up. She never once brought it up on her own.\n\nAround year three and a half, I had construction work happening. The crew backed a trailer into the garage and accidentally crushed the couch. When we looked closer, it was already moldy and torn apart by squirrels. The workers felt bad. I told them not to worry. It had been sitting there for years.\n\nWe even discussed whether I should tell her. Everyone agreed there wasn’t much point. She hadn’t mentioned it in over three years.\n\nSo I didn’t.\n\nFast forward to this year — now year six. I mention I’m cleaning out the garage and she casually says, “Oh, I need to come get that couch.”\n\nMe: “It’s gone. The squirrels got it.”  \nHer: “What?”  \nMe: “Yeah. The garage isn’t insulated. They love it in there.”  \nHer: “I had no idea.”  \nMe: “You did. You just forgot. And I said two weeks.”\n\nShe hasn’t spoken to me since. Unfriended. Full stop.\n\nMeanwhile, I lived around that couch. I broke my toe on it. I had to work around it constantly. I paid to have it hauled away. It took up space I didn’t have for three and a half years. The first time she brought it up was in year six.\n\nSo I’m really asking:  \nShould I have told her back when it got ruined, even though she hadn’t asked about it in years?  \nAt year six, should I have just said “sure, come get it” and played along, even though I doubt she would have?  \nOr was this always going to end the same way, no matter what I did?\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nFriend asked to store her dad’s couch “for two weeks.” I said no, then agreed with a firm limit. She left it for 3.5 years. Couch was destroyed. I tossed it and didn’t tell her. She finally mentioned it in year six. Now she’s upset. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "\nI (16M) have a strained relationship with my biological father (35M). He was horrible to my mother (33F, I dont know the fine details besides emotional abuse). They were teens seeking thrills, and were on-off until I was three. They went their separate ways. My mum has been my biggest supporter through life, facing legal troubles when corrupt social services members tried to take me away, being my biggest cheerleader when I came out, and pushing me towards my dream of acting.\n\nThe issue begins with him and I. It's been a wild goose chase over the last 16 years. Every couple of years he says he will step up, be a dad. He treats me decently well and we see each other often, until he decides he's bored and leaves again. My experiences have taught me to become used to it, because he will never change. He once left because mum asked him to contribute some money towards swimming lessons. This has happened 6 or 7 times, and it makes me feel like shit. My mum always supports me, but every time she tells me it wont ever change. \n\nAdditionally, he now has other children. My siblings and three stepsiblings. I love them all, and one of the hardest things about him leaving every time is knowing they'll leave too. They've gone through pain, being taken from their mother after dad and her split, he got custody (with the exclusion of one).\n\nBack in 2023, we lost my grandfather and my family was in shock. I was still speaking to dad at this point, and he came down to visit with his girlfriend. After she left our house, she reported us to social services because the house wasn't as clean as she expected (SS saw nothing wrong). I cut off contact entirely with them, potentially out of anger. I didn't speak to any of them until recently.\n\nAs I approach university, I've been reflecting on my youth, wondering if I should have changed anything. And I regret not seeing my siblings more. Everytime he pulled away I feel like I should've fought. Plus, I needed closure, so I called him. I told him how he had caused so much pain, how he has made it difficult for me to trust anyone ever again, and how despite everything, I still hold twisted love for him. We spoke more after that, I told him about my life, and he told me about my siblings.\n\nHere is the problem. I have agreed to enter a non father-son relationship with him for their sake. I want to see them badly. He is no longer my dad but I will call him dad when I see them. My worry is mum. She says she supports anything I do, and any steps I take is my prerogative. But, I see the mask slip when I talk about it, and how it hurts her that I have begun to speak to him again. Its all because of what he put her through. She'd never say anything. She wants me to be happy. But I feel like I'm hurting the one person who has been with me all along by letting him back into my life. And it hurts like hell. I don't want to hurt her like this, but at the same time I want to see my siblings more than anything. So am I the asshole?",

For some context i have been a gold girlie since i was born i only wear gold jewelry and everyone that knows me knows this including my boyfriend, because in the past he had already gifted me with gold jewelry. and for even more context my boyfriend is the type of person that procrastinates everything so he bought my birthday gift the day before my birthday. The day of the party my boyfriend was the first guest to arrive and he brought me a jewelry bag and told me to open it, i opened the bag and inside was a silver bracelet with 2 hearts pendants one being rose gold and the other one being gold, i was going to thank him for the bracelet when he realized that i didn’t like it he asked me if i liked it and i told him no, he looked visibly upset and i tried apologizing and asking him why did he buy me a silver bracelet he told me that in the store the bracelet looked gold. I don’t want to sound ungrateful and spoiled but i was visibly upset by that gift not because of the bracelet but because it looked like he didn’t even knew what i liked. I looked the bracelet online and it wasn’t expensive and for the same price and lower he could have gotten me something that i would like more. im going to put the link to the bracelet so ya’ll can see it \n\nhttps://www.onewatchcompany.com/pt/one-jewels/pulseira-one-crazy-heart-united_p2004.html\n\nAm i the asshole?",

      "post_title": "AITA for Asking My Parents to Pay Me Back?",
      "scenario_description": "I (19F) was asked by my parents two years ago to give them a total of $4000. The reason they had asked me was because my mother had recently lost her job at the same time that we had just moved to a pricier house, so it was really bad timing. Just to preface, I was not the only one they asked to borrow money from, they asked for help from my older brothers (22M and 31M) as well. However, because my 22 year old brother didn’t have a job and my 31 year old brother was already moved out and paying his own bills they only borrowed a $1000 from each of them. \n\nWhen they asked me for money I didn’t hesitate at all to say yes because my parents have been really supportive and caring of me and my siblings, and so I wanted to do my best to help them during these tough times. Fast forward to nearly two years later, my mother has found a new job and our financial situation is much more stable. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes: My parents promised they would pay me back as soon as my mother found another job. And they did, they immediately paid $1000 to me and my siblings. So they fully paid off my brothers, while still owing me $3000. In any other situation this would be fine with me, because I understand that they still have expenses and debts to pay. I’m not currently using that money as I am still living with them and am taking out loans for my studies. However, while they still do owe me money, they’ve also started to add a bunch of features and upgrades to the new house. They’ve done things like put grass in our yard, built a patio and shed in the backyard, among other things. And I know for a fact that the cost of these things far surpasses the money they owe me. \n\nBecause of this, I have started to feel anxious because I still haven’t gotten my money back. The money they borrowed was about half of my total money from my first ever part-time job. And now that I am older I have plans to move out and I want to invest that money they owe me.\n\nOne day they told me they had plans to expand our drive way. This was kinda my breaking point and it lead me to bring up the money they owe me, because this was yet another upgrade they didn’t need and would cost a fortune. But when I asked, my parents suddenly got very defensive, and they said that I shouldn’t be acting selfish like this and allowing money to get in the way of family. They also said that because of them, I don’t have to pay rent while I’m studying and working, so this was the least I can do. \n\nI love my parents and they insisted that they’ll pay me back when they can, but I can’t help but feel weird when I see them spending all this money and still not keeping or acknowledging their promise of paying me back sooner. But I’m also starting to have doubts after my conversation with them because it did make me feel like I’m a selfish person who only cares about money. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "So for some context, this happened about 2 weeks ago when I was on vacation. My aunt (47f) and her kids wanted to go shopping. I (16m) am not a very big fan of shopping in general so I decided to not go. She asked my grandmother (72f) and my grandfather (89m) if they wanted to go. My grandfather isn’t very stable while walking so she said they could sit on a bench if they wanted to or they could take breaks. They agreed to go and went. Once they got there she asked my grandfather if he wanted to walk with them or sit in the car. He wanted to sit in the car so they left and went shopping. My grandmother couldn’t leave my grandfather alone so she also stayed in the car. She has a bad knee though so she can’t sit still for too long. After about 30 minutes the air in the car turned off. My aunt came back to the car 30 minutes after the air went out. When they came back my grandma explained what happened to me and I told her she was out of line for inviting them to make them sit in the car with no a/c for half an hour. She basically told me that they didn’t have to come if they didn’t want to and that it was lying to her about the air going out and that I wouldn’t know because I wasn’t there. At this point I was pissed and started yelling at her. I was so mad that I don’t even remember what I said to her but later that day she said that I was wrong to yell at her and she expects an apology. I obviously told her that wasn’t going to happen and I walked away from her.",

      "scenario_description": "I (13F) was working in a group project in my humanities class at school. The assignment was to choose a current topic/issue and create an infographic/fake campaign to educate people about it and persuade people to be different/change. The teacher gave us some example topics like \"mental heath awareness, universal healthcare, composting, banning plastic, allergies, less AI in school. \n\nWe got to choose groups of 1-4 people, though I didn't really have any friends in this class so I was initally planning to work solo. But three girls (all good friends with each other) ended up asking me to group with them, they said because I was good at art (because we have to design an infographic) and all of them suck at it. I am pretty good at art, have been taking classes for years and its like my biggest hobby and I won awards and stuff. So I joined their group and it was decided that I would do the infographic design/art part and they would do the research/writing part.\n\nAt this point the groups were set, and we had to decide on a topic. All of them wanted to do a certain topic, but I personally don't support it and it goes against my beliefs. (I’d rather not say the exact topic to avoid derailing, but LMK if it matters for judging of if there are any other questions). \n\nWhen I told my groupmates this and that we could choose a different topic they laughed and said that I was wrong and people who don't agree with that topic are evil and that I must be joking. Then they yapped for a long time on how important their topic was, etc. I knew arguing wasn't going to help so I just pretended to agree with them after like 10 minutes \"oh haha nevermind I was just kidding\" and I would deal with the issue later.\n\nLater, privately, I asked the teacher if I could leave their group, and she allowed me to. So now I'm working on the project solo, on another topic that I chose. The thing is that I didn't tell my groupmates that I left the project, I just didn't sit with them the next day and tried to avoid them. They left me alone too and there was never a confrontation so I thought there were no more issues.\n\nBut then the project grades came out I got an A and they got a B (I overheard them complaining). The teacher even showed my infographic as a model example to the class. Now its like a switch is flipped and those three girls are acting super passive aggressive. Like mentioning that I don't agree with their topic, and telling other people that I promised to be in their group but bailed when I didn't get my way.\n\nAITA?",

When I arrived home we talked some more just about general things .(mind you I was basically the beloved grandson out of all her grandchildren) and she asked oh how’s your friend doing with what’s going on and I told her my friend is doing better her neighbor is helping her through it and she’s really pretty especially with her hijab. Then next thing I know I’m getting lectured about religion blah blah then she asked “ is Jesus in your life “ and I told her no he’s not since I didn’t want to lie to her she’s getting up there in age and it really hurt me to lie to her really about anything . And the stare she gave me okay and just stopped talking which I took that as my queue to leave and go inside. I tell her I love her and will go help her out again before I leave again and she just says “ok bye “ and that was the last I heard of her until I texted her hey do you need any help and I got a reply saying “ I just want to be left alone please.” And that’s where my life is right now the person that raised me my whole life disowned me for being honest with her",

      "scenario_description": "So here’s what happened. My friends, John and Jane, and I were supposed to meet in my town for a festival, but it got rained out. I offered to drive toward them instead (about an hour for me) so we could still hang out and get dinner. Everyone agreed, and we met at a restaurant John picked—not a bar, just a dinner spot—but it was super crowded and loud. None of us could really hear each other talking.\n\nWe had a great meal and finished up. While we were boxing up our leftovers, John (kindly) paid for dinner. Then he and Jane ordered another beer. I don’t drink, so I was just sitting there. About 45 minutes passed with them slowly sipping their beers—John was mostly on his phone—and I finally said, “Okay, you guys gotta chug those, let’s go for a walk or something.”\n\nTen more minutes passed and they still weren’t even halfway through. I finally said, “Alright, we’re leaving—you can leave the beers.” John walked downstairs to finish his at the bar, and Jane said, “Well, he paid for it—he wants to finish it.” I responded, “It’s been almost an hour. It’s loud, hot, and you’ve both been on your phones.”\n\nI left feeling like they were annoyed with me, but honestly, I was frustrated. They both know I don’t drink and that I have sensory issues—it’s hard for me to sit in chaotic environments like that, especially doing nothing and being ignored. When I first asked them to finish their beers, I suggested we walk around downtown so we could actually do something and still hang out, but they didn’t seem interested. I had driven an hour to meet them and tried to be flexible after our original plan got rained out, but it felt like they weren’t meeting me halfway.\n\nThis isn’t a one-time thing either. They regularly invite me to stay the night—even though they know I have two dogs and two cats at home, and I always tell them I can’t leave my animals overnight. Even on the Fourth of July, after I explained that I stay home because fireworks are hard on my pets, they kept asking me to come out again. It’s like my answers or boundaries aren’t enough, and they just ignore or push past them.\n\nAnother layer: whenever plans change—especially if I’m the one suggesting something different—John always makes little digs or sarcastic comments about how he doesn’t enjoy the new plan as much. It’s subtle, but it adds up and makes me feel like a bad friend just for asking for something different or more comfortable for me.\n\nI guess I’m just feeling weird right now. Like… am I reading too much into things? Am I being overly sensitive? Or are these red flags in a friendship that’s become kind of one-sided? I’m trying to be self-aware here, but I also feel kind of disrespected. So—AITA?",

      "post_title": "AITA for Adjusting my In-Laws Thermostat while Dog Sitting?",
      "scenario_description": "Never thought I would be posting here, but I need some help on how much I should dig in here…\n\nMy in-laws, who live about a 30 minute drive away, left for a 3 week vacation and asked us to watch their 2 dogs (one of which is older and needs special diet/meds/attention). My wife and I have 3 dogs of our own and a smaller house and yard, so the wife and their parents decided on house sitting while they were gone and just relocating to the in-laws place as the better choice for all logistics.\n\nWe moved a ton of stuff over, my wife is 6 months pregnant and we have a 2-year-old, so staying for a few weeks involved more than just a small bag as you can imagine. I even decided to breakdown my home office and move equipment so I would be here for the remote work hours with the dogs. Been going well, lots of furries running round the yard, getting all the pets and treats they could want.\n\nThe conflict. They (father-in-law) has a smart thermostat for the HVAC/AirCon. It is set with a predetermined automatic schedule. During the day he has it programmed set at 77F/25C. We are a little warmer than preferred during the day, we have popped it down a few times to 74F/23C to take the edge off, but have left it alone.\n\nAt night, the program on the thermostat is set to 80F/26C!!! Thermometer in the bedrooms shows actual temperatures to be about 78F/25.5C.\n\nAfter laying down on the first night for a bit and both myself and my pregnant wife uncomfortable and having trouble falling asleep with it being warmer than how we sleep at our house, I did a manual adjustment down to 74F/23C. I continued and made a manual adjustment down to this temperature each night. I have adjusted it now for a week  down to this lower temperature just so my family could be more comfortable and get a better nights sleep.\n\nFather-in-Law texted this morning upset. Saying to leave it alone, he received an energy and usage report that there has been an increase in the last week, and that we can sleep in the basement at night (no bed in basement and 6-month pregnant wife).\n\nI responded that they should call us later today and we could discuss further, but the plan was to reimburse them the energy cost difference for while we were staying here. I didn’t tell him this, but I plugged in house size, current energy prices, and HVAC unit into ChatGPT to estimate energy cost difference and AI said maybe a $30 - $40 cost difference for the little lower temperature at night for the three weeks. I don’t know how accurate this estimate is, but I would gladly pay $100+ if it meant my wife could sleep in a bed at a reasonable temperature and have no more argument on the subject.\n\nJudge me Reddit, be brutal, any feedback to help me decide how much push-back to give. AITA for adjusting my father-in-laws thermostat?\n\nEdit for detail: The in-laws 3 week vacation is a river cruise in Europe, so trying to just handle most things rather than bug them with too many texts while they are abroad.\n\nEdit 2: Just heard back from them after I offered to pay. He said “it’s potential damage to the hvac system with multiple temperature changes daily.  Energy cost is secondary.”  Lowering the HVAC temperature once at bedtime to 74 degrees, does that really run a risk of damage? (US Central Air, Lennox Compressor from 2022)\n\nEdit 3: They ended up calling as I asked, though begrudgingly as he said he didn’t know what needed to be talked about when I kept asking we all talk. One of my texts in the back-and-forth was that the unnecessary conflict was stressing out the pregnant wife and that realigned them a bit. I was in the shower with the call timing sadly, but he is going to remotely reprogram it to schedule night temps down to 75. In hindsight, how in the world did this devolve into conflict!?!

I work a part time job along with my studies so I really need a check up. My friend told me he'd send it to my online banking and the day goes on. When I returned home, my dad (45M) greeted me as usual and he asked to borrow my phone (He uses it to watch stuffs to pass the time). The next day when I was about to cash the money out, I noticed that my balanced was zero and I immediately panicked, when I saw the history, it showed an online c*sin* website and the money is transfered to it. I confronted my dad about it and he denied it, he only told me when he noticed my eyes the next day all swelled up from crying and I completely broke down and asked him why would he do that. I've been working extra to give the money back and I am currently not talking to my dad. I just want that check up man.",

      "scenario_description": "As some background information, I (16, male) have an extremely large collection of stuffed animals, including Jellycats, Care Bears, and Build-A-Bears which I began collecting when I was around 11 or 12. I was bullied during my childhood for being autistic and spent a lot of time in hospitals which I feel like I had to act more mature than what I was to try and deal with it, so collecting these toys has helped me reconnect with my younger self. I will admit I do have a very big connection to them they all have names and personalities\n\nMy mom has been very supportive when it comes to my neurodivergence but my stepdad isn't, My relationship with my stepdad has always been strained. A month ago, he stopped taking his medication for depression, believing he didn’t need it. Since then, our interactions have deteriorated. We’ve been snapping at each other, and my attempts to set boundaries have been ignored; he sees them as an attack on him.\n\nThe main reason I came here is that yesterday I was running late for a taster day at the college I'm starting at, and I accidentally left my door open. I thought it would be fine since we have a gate at the top of the stairs to stop our dogs from coming up. When I got home, I realised that my only childhood stuffed animal I've kept, Charleston, wasn’t on my bed. I tried looking around, thinking maybe I had left it on the floor, but he wasn’t there.\n\nI went downstairs to ask my stepdad if he had seen Charleston, and he told me that the dogs had taken him off my bed. He let the dogs have him because he thought it was “just a stupid stuffed toy that I should have left behind in secondary school.” I feel like I might have overreacted because I shouted at him, telling him he had no right to throw my stuffed animal away like that. I know I shouldn’t have but I swore at him.\n\nIt escalated into a fight where he said that I need to start acting like an adult, get a job, and grow up. And that I'm a slob. He isn't entirely wrong; I've been putting off getting a job before starting college to see if I can handle it.  In the heat of the moment, I told him he was weighing down the family and that my life was better before he married my mom. I ended up going through the trash and found Charleston. He was completely fine, just a bit dirty, which was an easy fix. I haven't spoken to my stepdad since.\n\nMy mom thinks I’m being overdramatic since it’s just a stuffed animal, but to me, it means so much more than that. My stepdad has always hated Charleston, as if his very existence offends him. I’m wondering how the dogs got to Charleston if the gate was closed and why he didn’t have any marks on him. If my dog had gotten hold of him, there would only be shreds left. They both know how much Charleston means to me; he’s been there for me through every surgery and bad day at school. Plus,  the toy was discontinued, so if I hadn’t found him, I wouldn’t have been able to buy another. ATIA?\n\nEdit: hi guys and ty for the positive comments! I just wanna clarify for people asking more about why I haven’t gotten a job . I was only legally able to work for the last two months of secondary school and my main concern was sitting my GCSE’s . Me and my mom had agreed on me waiting before working . And my stepdad had agreed till recently we also wanted to focus on getting my health back to a good place before I started college ",

A shouting match, with insults like ‘degenerate gambler’ and ‘superficial bitch.’ So I said to them ‘You want me to take Tim to Henry’s restaurant?’ Amy said ‘Yes, please’ and Josh just nodded.\n\nWhen we got there and Tim got his dinner, I talked to Henry. We were standing away not too far away from the table, whispering. Henry told me Tim is old enough to understand what is going on with his parents and that adults can be mean to each other.

      "scenario_description": "I (20 F) went on a trip with my boyfriend (21 M) and his family for three days (we’re currently on day 2.) We’ve been dating for 7 months and the red flags were already showing but I chose to swallow them because I’m the type of person that doesn’t like conflict. I’ve never been around this side of his family and he knows I’m shy in general, so I expected us to be doing things together and not him leaving me behind. We get to the grocery store and he immediately runs off without me, leaving me with said family. I know I seem to be over exaggerating because it’s not like they bite but I was hoping he’d stay with me a bit and let me get comfortable rather than leaving me behind. Another instance is when we went to the beach. He ran off, AGAIN, and left me with them on the beach. I had to hear about him him him the entire time and I only got introduced to his cousin (that randomly showed up) near the end of the conversation even though I was sitting right there beside them when she came. I don’t think it’s worth mentioning but they’re white and I’m black, so I’m already feeling like the odd one out. I wasn’t having fun, I was hot, under excited and ready to leave, so I told him that. He acted like I rained on every parade that he’s ever been to and made me feel guilty and ungrateful for not liking the experience. I really feel bad because they didn’t force me to come and I don’t want to hold him back from having fun. so aita? \n\n(Edit): I am NOT saying I demanded to be taken home, I said I’d rather be at home. Saying “find a new boyfriend” is odd considering the fact that I didn’t ask for advice on my love life, and instead asked if I was an asshole for disliking a trip. It’s the trip that I don’t like.",

      "scenario_description": "I 28F has been married for 6 months now I live with my super loving husband and MIL. My MIL tho is not what I expected her to be at first she was good but then lately she started to create problems between me and my husband. I've been hearing quite a lot about her problematic behaviour from my sister in law's but I used to brush them of thinking if MIL is good to me then I need not to worry about her. \n\nNow the drama part she wants me to talk to people who she talks to, and not to talk with people who she has started beef with. earlier she was okay with me talking with them, bcz she was talking with them but then now she has a beef with them. She wants me to stop talking with them now that friends with them (them being my husband's eldest brothers family) and stop going to their house which I think is unfair. I can’t be controlled like that like I need to have my own space and control on my own life. I am not a puppet. \n\nso now that I’m not listening to her. She started abusing me literally cursing me because I was not listening to her. I told my husband about that and he understandably talked to her mother. but she won’t listen to anybody. \n\nA few weeks ago she was fighting with me, bcz I went to their house she went crazy she said so many bad things about me and my period. I literally started to cry when I was standing in the kitchen and half of the things I forgot what she said, (that’s how I am)\n\nand I don’t know if she cursed my parents or not. It seems like she did. I didn’t hear it properly, but I feel like she did, and I took it to the sky. I was furious, and I was so so mad. ( Rightfully so) And when my husband got back from work. She told him her perspective and painted me bad, which was very weird. like hello, you were the one who started the fight. You were the one who cursed me and my parents, you were the one put it all the wrong things and now I am the bad person???\n\n\nThen later, my husband asked me about the situation and I told him the truth, but about the part where she cursed my parents or not I thought she did, so I told my husband she did and thankfully my husband was mad on her mom too as to why to bring my parents in a fight they don't even know is happening. \n\n\nMy MIL was saying she does not want to stay with me and that she wants to go to her daughters house. My husband used to stop her before this fight but this time he didn’t. so now I don’t know if I am the bad one like, I think I am taking advantage of the situation because I am not completely sure if she did or not, she like used to mumble things, and I think I heard her curse my parents, which was very wrong, of course but then I don’t know if she did or not. ( English is not my first language so bare with me).",

      "scenario_description": "I (32F) feel stuck between my husband (34M) and my family, and I don’t know if I handled this the right way.\n\nMy brother (30s) has always been the golden child in my mom’s eyes. He has several kids but barely parents them. My mom (60s) watches his children constantly while he sleeps, plays video games, or just disappears. Any time someone brings up how unfair this is, she makes excuses like “he’s just tired” or “he’s doing his best.” He rarely shows up to help, and everyone is expected to tiptoe around it.\n\nRecently things got worse. My husband owns his own business and works hard to provide for our family. After a dumb disagreement with my brother, my brother actually threatened my husband’s business. Like straight-up said he’d mess with it. Not even in a joking way.\n\nThen, he demanded my husband return the furniture we had bought and given him. This was stuff we purchased to help him when he was going through a tough time. It wasn’t a loan. It was a gift. But suddenly he was acting like we owed him something.\n\nSo yeah - my husband got mad. He made a comment about how my brother doesn’t do anything, never helps with his own kids, and how my mom constantly enables him. It was honest. Maybe a little harsh, but not inaccurate.\n\nI didn’t say anything. I didn’t defend my brother because honestly, my husband was right. I’ve felt that way for years but always kept quiet to avoid drama.\n\nLater, my mom pulled me aside and told me I should have stood up for my brother. She said I let my husband “disrespect family” and accused me of changing since I got married. She made me feel like I betrayed them by not taking my brother’s side.\n\nNow I feel completely torn. My husband is working hard, doing his part, and constantly getting disrespected. But my mom acts like I should cover for my brother no matter what.\n\nSo, AITA for not defending my brother when my husband called him out?\n\n\nEDIT- seeing a lot of people thinking I didn’t defend my husband, I left that part out bc I didn’t need judgement on if I was TA for doing that. My family and I haven’t spoke since this happened and I definitely had a screaming match with my mother after this happened. ",
