      "scenario_description": "Edit: Okay, I do appreciate the feedback and I do agree i should not have caved that being said I don't intend to be alone with him but if I do I will keep in mind all the other different ways to handle the situation in a more positive way. Also I worded the title wrong I did not directly say he was not special or unique I said he is not anymore special or unique than someone else. I also only told him that after he tried to use it as a reason for me to get him what he wanted after I said no. \n\nI caved due to the pressure I was feeling from everyone else around me, and I also did not want the rest of my vaction to be awkward. I know my sister very well had I not caved she would have made that the focus and I don't get to see my family very often. NY to Hawaii is not exactly a cheap or short flight. My family also rarely leaves the island so yeah. Does not excuse my behavior but I wanted to enjoy the rest of my vaction w8th family without taking jabs from my sister. Already get enough shit for what I do for a living from her and my parents. \n\nThe target order was for my mom not my sister, but yes my sister who has money does shop at Target. As mentioned he was not in school when I was over but school year is almost over and maybe she kept him home since I don't visit often that was the first time I saw him since he was born. Though yes my sister and husband 100% have the money to hire teachers or tutors to home school. I did not ask. \n\nI will show her the Bluey episode many have linked doubt she will watch it but I will forward it and I will forward this thread. Also, I have not asked her how does she thinks this will play out when he is older but I know my sister and pretty sure she would simply say people will love him or she will just get mad I dare to suggest he would become a rapist or a criminal. \n\nI accept I am an asshole here, not going to lie shocked to see so many YTA instead of ESH but I get this post was about mu actions and not so much my sister's or mom's. \n\nGoing to turn off notifications for now, thanks again for the feedback and different ways I could have handled the situation. Have a good one everyone.​\n\n\n\nFor context he is the first and only grandchild so far, and probably will be the only grandchild unless my sister has moee kids. Yes, he is an only child and everyone spoils him rotten. I don't have much engagement with them since I live in a different state.\n\nI recently went to visit my family, one weekend was supposed to go with my sister and my nephew to indoor playground / arcade but something came up on her end so I offered to take my nephew since we did plan to make a day of it. She agreed, and overall it was a lot of fun. He was fine the entire day, did not fuss or anything.\n\nMy mom asked if I could pickup her order from Target, it was in the area so I said sure. Order was not ready so we killed time walking around. Apparently this was my grave mistake, I was unaware my sister gets him whatever he wants when he wants it. She does very well for herself. He showed me, a Nerf gun he wanted, I commented and said that was cool. He did not ask for it anything, and he still had it in his hand. i did not think much of it in the moment since I did the same as a kid and when it was time I would leave at the counter.\n\nMom's order was done went to pick it up and he fully expected me to buy it. I told him I waa not going to buy it and maybe he could ask his mom for it next time. I offered to take a picture of it so he could show her exactly what he wanted. That is when he told me his mom would not mind, she always gets him what he wants because he is special and special people get whatevee they want. ​In this context I kind get in hindsight from a kids POV no one really tells him no.\n\nI told him I was not everyone else, and I had no intention of buying anything at the store. He doubled down started to fuss telling me I had to listen to him because he was the kid and he is special. That is when I told him, he is no more special or unique to anyone else. He was still giving me a hard time, during that time my mom called I picked up she shouted I would not buy him what he wants. My mom told me to stop being so cheap and buy it.\n\nI was started to get embarrassed and very uncomfortable I had no idea how to handle the situation so I bought it because we were making a scene, and I don't have much experience with kids. ​​When we got home I explained the situation my mom and sister were not pleased. My sister told me she does not believe in telling a child no. They also were mad I did not reaffirm that he is not special because he should be the most special person to me. He is a gift and such, my sister struggled to have kids.\n\nEdit: Sorry for the long post and typos on mobile and auto correct can be weird. I know in the end I caved though which just reinforces the behavior anyways.",

My sister came home one day from school and said to me “come look at this” she opened her mouth and I see a long metal tongue peircing and I  gag not expecting what she showed me, I ask her what it is, so she tells me it’s a tongue peircing and that I couldn’t tell anyone. And in my obvious fashion I said “nah I won’t”\n\nAnd it’s been 2 weeks so far and she has been non stop complaining about how much it hurts all the time. My parents have non stop interrogating me knowing I can’t keep secrets very well. And it hasn’t been about the piercing in particular but also saying things like “you seem off you keeping a secret or something?” Scaring the shit out of me every-time.\n\nSince she is 18 all my friends are telling me that my parents cannot get frustrated with her since she is a legal adult and she can do what she wants. \nI get that but also she is still living at home so I feel like my parents also would have a say on these kind of things. \nThanks for reading! I appreciate any feedback \n\nUpdate: she was caught with it today so no more issues thank you all for your responses! ",

      "scenario_description": "I 40m and my wife 39f have 3 great kids, 13m, 12f, and 9f. \n\nOur youngest daughter doesn't handle horror very well , she can only handle Scooby do and even that is sometimes too scary for her. But she of course wants to see scary stuff and throws temper tantrums when we say no. \n\nLast night my wife and our two older kids wanted to watch Alien and we figured we'd watch it after our youngest daughter was in bed ( since it's summer we've bumped her bedtime up to 9:30 ).\n\nAfter my wife and I put our daughter to bed we went downstairs to start the movie. After the movie had started our youngest daughter came down and asked what movie we were watching. We asked her why she wasn't in bed and she said she heard her sister mention that we were gonna watch a movie and asked if she could watch to. \n\nWe told her no because it was too scary for her but she kept insisting that she could handle it. I eventually firmly told her no but she kept insisting that she could handle it. \n\nSo I picked her up and carried her back to her bed, she screamed and protested the whole time saying \" no daddy I wanna watch the movie \"!\n\nWhen I tucked her back in bed she kept protesting saying it wasn't fair to have family movie time without her, that's when I said to her \" this is not family movie time this is a time for people who are big enough for scary movies and you're too little for scary movies \".\n\nShe said \" no daddy I'm big enough for scary movies \" and tried to get out of bed, thats when I raised my voice and firmly told her \" no your too little for scary movies and it is past your bedtime now if you get out of bed again your in trouble \"! \n\nI then tucked her back into bed and kissed her goodnight.\n\nThen we all watched the movie as planned, we could hear our daughter screaming and having a tantrum from upstairs for a while but we ignored it and it did stop. \n\nI thought i handed it fine until today when my wife came to me very upset with me for how I handled it. \n\nShe said it would've been better to just let her watch a movie that was appropriate for her with us and then put her to bed and watch Alien because then she wouldn't have felt excluded. I disagreed because our daughter knew it was past her bedtime. But my wife still thinks I didn't handle it right. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I put family business in quotes because it only has my parents name on it.  I (32F) have been helping them open it (opening the end of June) set up door dash, menus, renovation, making employee handbooks, hiring people, etc. All of the months I spent with them working in the shop 5-6 days a week for months went unpaid for. Occasionally they would buy me and my son breakfast or lunch.\n\nMy son is 4. She expects me to work in a dangerous environment (bakery/coffee shop) with him somehow. When I voice my concerns about how it’s dangerous, she tells me “lots of kids grow up in businesses. Get over it. He’s lucky” I’m like what? Are you ok? \n\nI quit a few months ago bc they are gonna pay non family employees normal wages & under pay me because I’m family. When I spoke up about it, my mom said all I care about is money. She threw everything she did for me in my childhood & said how dare I. She apologized later on & asked me to come back & I said ok because I felt guilty. \n\nI quit for the 2nd (& final) time last weekend when my brother (30M) flew home (we are in NJ) from Texas for 1 week to help. This is his 1 week of help to my months of help. I told them (mom, dad, bro) I wasn’t coming in this last weekend because I had plans with my husband & son. They were mad. My brother decides to text me 22 times & call 5 about a window sign when I was driving with my husband & son. I blue toothed that I would call back when I could. He then said “it’s funny how I can text but not call” I didn’t feel like explaining that I talk to text so I said “who are u talking to like that?” He then told me to “shut the fuck up” & I’m a “nobody”\n\nMy breaking point is he texted me back “shut the fuck up” (this is all in the group chat w our parents btw) We aren’t close & I would just never say that to anyone let alone him. I just said I would call when I could.  \n\nMy quitting point was when my mom privately texted me that I was the rude one for saying “who are you talking to like that” & that it was ok my brother said STFU as a response back to me. She said I was a pos & she will replace me. I didn’t answer. She said she will never forgive me & will never speak to me again because they are supposed to be opening Friday & if it fails, it’s my fault. I never asked them for this business to be opened. It’s not even mine. I was just helping because it was the right thing to do. Ugh. \n\nEdit: like I said we have not spoken in 5 days. It’s 2am here. I see I have 14 texts notifications. I look and it’s her “ha” reacting to everything I said to her. I wanna post screen shots below. ⬇️ we literally haven’t talked and she’s now going thru them (drunk I assume) hahaing my messages 🥴\n\nEdit 2: nevermind I can’t post screen shots it won’t let me. It was just me telling her why I’m quitting and why I’m upset. No cursing no disrespect. She just keeps hahaing things from the convo but not saying anything. I’m glad I cut her off. \n\n***update*** it’s been almost a week of NC. This is the longest we have gone without talking since my son’s been born. I didn’t block my mom bc I am waiting for her to say something awful/unhinged to me again. It just helps me when I start feeling guilty. My brother never talks to me anyway so I know he won’t say anything. As for my “neutral” dad… I will most likely be LC w him. I’ll probably wish him a happy Father’s Day on Sunday (mainly from my son) It’s hard with him bc he just ended his cancer treatments. He’s recovering fine. My mom loved using his prostate cancer as a weapon against me whenever I voiced concerns about anything regarding my employment at the shop. Thank you all SO much. I’ve read every single comment & I reread them when I start feeling bad about the situation. I appreciate every one of yous ",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nSo I (34 f) have a little sister (28 f) that needed somewhere to go to get her and her 3 small kids away from her abusive boyfriend. My wife and I had just moved across the country, back to my hometown, to be closer to the family literally about two weeks prior to us giving her somewhere safe to stay. Shortly after that she made up a story about taking the kids camping with her two best friends. Later, we find out (from the kids) that they were actually with said ex boyfriend. I sat her down and explained to her that I knew the truth and that I knew she lied to me. She altered the story slightly to include him saying he “just showed up” yet none of the other friends were even there😐\n\nFast forward to this weekend and my wife and I are out of town. Sister is at the housing watching the dogs so she reaches out and says her and her best friend are taking a trip to Colorado. Cool. I tell her to have so much fun. We converse a bit about Colorado over the weekend and then I went to text her again and her location popped up (she had said a few days before that she was setting up Siri and it must have messed up her location settings when I asked why her location was off). Her location said she was in Arkansas (which she used to take a lot of trips to when she was dating the ex boyfriend) so I straight up ask her “hey why are you in Arkansas?” And she replies saying they changed the plan due to money and I said “Is that true? Cause I know you went to AR with *ex boyfriend” all the time and really hope you’re not lying to me again”. She went on to assure me she was telling the truth even adding in more detail about her friend and what they did.\n\nThat was yesterday. I got an unrelated call today from one of my best friends. We talked about things in our lives going on since I’d been out of state and then she asks if my sister was dating that guy again. I ask her why she’d ask and she says because they just went on a trip together and she saw it on facebook. He posted multiple pictures and even named the exact place my sister had claimed to be with her friend. \n\nI set a boundary, after the first lie, that if she wanted to live with us then she couldn’t also be with him. Now, if she wants to go date that loser then it’s her life and she absolutely can…just not while living with us. Also, that she can’t lie to me. We are trusting her with our home, our pets, and everything that comes with it. It’s supposed to be our safe space and this guy is OFF THE RAILS with alcohol, drugs, and violence. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to kick her out for lying to me and hanging out with him?",

It’s something I care deeply about and have spent my early 20s on. I built it from the ground up to give people a way to shop responsibly and support small businesses that actually give a shit about people and the planet.\n\nLast weekend, I was at a family dinner and my uncle (50M) who's always been a little snide about anything he sees as “woke,” made a comment like, *“So how’s your little hippie shop going? Still saving the world one bamboo toothbrush at a time?”*\n\nEveryone laughed. I tried to brush it off, but he kept going. Something about how I’m “just selling overpriced junk to virtue-signalers” and how “normal people don’t care about that stuff.”\n\nI kinda lost it and said, *“At least I’m not helping exploit child laborers because I can’t be bothered to shop responsibly.”* That shut him up fast, but now my family thinks I was being “disrespectful” and “too intense,” especially since he's older than me and he's family. My mom told me I embarrassed him and made everyone uncomfortable.\n\nBut honestly?? I don’t feel bad. I’m sick of people acting like trying to do the right thing is some kind of joke.",

      "scenario_description": "I had a friend come visit from out of town for a long weekend. We've been friend over 20 years,  and I was excited to see her.\n\nShe's had cats in the past, but married someone who is highly allergic to almost anything with fur, so she hasn't had any furred pets in many years (she has some reptiles). I have nurmerous cats, and she was also excited to get a weekend of kitties.\n\nHowever, it became clear very quickly that she doesn't live with cats. Leaving food unattended, putting cups on the edge of the coffee table/counter, etc, made it a very messy weekend. But whatever, right?\n\nThen there was the dental floss.\n\nFor context here, one of my cats ate a string he pulled out of a rug several months ago, and I paid THOUSANDS to save him. Like, he should have died - not only was it a very long string, but he had numerous post-op complications. But he is my baby, and it was money well spent to me. My cat learned exactly nothing from the experience - he still LOVES string and hair ties, and I am hypervigilant about such things being left out where he can access them.\n\nI told my friend she CANNOT throw dental floss in the bathroom trash - it has to go in the kitchen trash. The bathroom trash had a lid, but this cat is very smart and very determined. And in the event the lid doesn't get closed, it's essentially leaving string right at cat-height.\n\nWell, she didn't get the (very direct, not even a hint) hint. I kept finding floss in the bathroom trash, and twice I found it just laying on the counter, waiting to be swallowed. The first couple times, I tried to gently remind her. Then I directly told her again. When I found floss, yet again, just laying on the counter, I told her she needed to hand over her floss. I have the little floss picks she can use, but I cannot have long strings just being left around the house willy nilly. I cannot afford to have another major emergency vet surgery. I was not rude about it, and I did not yell or anything, but it was just too big a risk to keep allowing her to leave it lying about. \n\nShe complied, but after she went home her husband called me and said I was being totally put of line and treating her like a child, and that I should be more concerned with teaching my cat not to eat string. I do sort of see his point, but the reality is I tried to remind her not to do it, and it wasn't sticking. It's literally  a safety issue in my home - one that could mean life or death. If she couldn't manage to dispose of floss in the kitchen, then my only choice to protect my dumb ass cat is to remove the dangerous item. There is no \"teaching\" a cat to not use their insticts, and hunting/eating things is instinct.\n\nAITA here? I feel like no, but the way her husband acted, I'm now not totally sure.\n\n(And yes, I gave her floss back before she left. I'm not a floss thief)",

      "scenario_description": "I'm 19(F) currently in college, no part time, and still living with my parents. For context, me and my mom have always had a difficult relationship, especially ever since I turned 18. \nFor some time she has been calling me ungreatful daughter, who doesn't retribute her sacrifies and all the labour she has done to provide for me and my brother. Although it's true I don't always do exactly as she says, or when she says, I still try to do my best and it's still not enough. In no way I'm saying I'm the perfect daughter. Lately however I've talking back to her when I try to defend myself or I try to ignore her comments so it doesn't hurt or affect me that deeply, wich lead us to having more arguments than ever. Whenever I try to defend myself or try to be reasonable with her, it always ends up in a whole argument with my mom threatening me to kick me out of the house or stop finacing my studies. She even admited herself that sometimes she says those things porpusefully to make me react and finally take action on my life, since this year I've been a bit divided when it comes to my career.\n I constantly feel this confusion around her, like I want to do better, I want to be really greatful for everything that she has done to me, and still feel a lot of resentment till now towards my parents, especially my mom. Her behaviour towards me confuses me a lot, in times she expresses how sorry she is for talking to me like that, and that she only wants the best for us and that she couldn' have asked for better children, and moments later she is yelling at me saying I don't do anything for her or the family, and she'll kick me out of the house if I keep the pace. It makes me constantly questions wether or not she really loves me or she's just bearing me over her shoulders until now, and makes me wonder if the one in the wrong here is actually me.\nSorry if my english is not perfect, since it's not my native language. I just needed to pull this off of me.",

We don't have huge amounts of disposable income left after bills are paid, and additionally, our annual leave is limited.  The wedding destination requires a minimum of 1-week annual leave, as the location is off the beaten track (not a direct flight).\n\nHowever, my friend who is getting married has already said that she thinks that as she is giving people enough notice (over a year), then she would expect most, if not all, to make it. We've been friends a long time and so I feel this expectation, and we could use our savings towards this if we wanted to.\n\nWIBTA for not going?",

After he decided that he would not finish school I set a deadline of him finding a job within a month. Another month passed and I informed mom of me limiting the privileges I give him which is the internet. A bad day came when I asked if he could take my dog outside in the morning and he did not do it until very late so my dog peed all over the floor and dragged it on the new carpet he did not let me know because he wanted to keep playing games so it soaked into the everwhere, this infuriated me and I let him know that everything costs money and I am sick of him not being considerate of the things that are around him. I informed him that I would be removing his internet and I did. When my spouse was back we discussed a solid plan to get him to start doing better and set him up for success which was that if he got a GED I would give him back the internet for 3-4 hours a day and once he got a job all privileges would be returned to him. When my mom was informed of this she immediately got mad at me and threatened that they would move out. Another month passed and I just thought maybe he is studying or at least applying for a job but he was doing none. I started to get a bit more frustrated at this time because I see no progress and stated to blame me for his depression because he has no internet. Today he decided to come to me after being rude to me all week and refusing to do any chores I give him, to ask if he could be on the internet to get some limited edition stuff on one of his games. I told him he couldn’t because he has had a lot of time to get at least a GED to have some internet and that consequences are consequences so he would have to miss out. He began walking away calling me bitch. Once my mom got home I told her what had happened so she could at least tell him to respect me and she said that I was in the wrong that it was just a bit of time he would be on the internet and proceeded to tell me to return it to him to which I informed her that consequences are consequences and he had full control of gaining internet access once he did the right thing. My mom exploded once I told her that and once again started to threaten me saying she has no say in anything that happens in the house or even control over her kid. She said she would just find a place to live and that I was very hard on him and my consequences are just like Nazis. My mother said that she is just trying to protect her boy from me and once she said this I was upset and told her I am not a Nazi for enforcing boundaries to him trying to financially and emotionally take advantage of me. I told her to do whatever she wanted to do and that if she thinks leaving is best she should do it.",

I watch her and we hang out at least once a week, I have taken her swimming, amusement parks, aquariums… etc. This past weekend I took her on a real hike for the first time. I told both her moms where we were going, I didn’t give times for when we would be back as I didn’t know how long the hike would take, I have watched her all day before though and everything has always gone great. When we got down from the hike and drove back into cell service I received a barrage of angry messages from both of them about why I wasn’t responding and what I was doing with their daughter. I told them we were on our way back now and I was going to get her dinner and that there wasn’t any cell service. They told me they would be feed her and to bring her home immediately. When I brought her back I got glares and side eyes from them, they wanted to talk but I was honestly upset at the damper this had out on our great day so I told them we could talk later and I left.\n\nI understand being worried about her up in the mountains but I am struggling to see what I could/should have done differently? I’ll talk to them soon but wanted to hear what you all think?",

      "scenario_description": "My grandma (“Nana”) was the glue of our family. Every Christmas she’d bake **Brown-Butter Pecan Clouds**—a shortbread-meets-meringue cookie that melts in your mouth. The recipe was never written down; she taught it to me (28 F) over several weekends in 2019 after I begged her to preserve it somehow. Nana passed in 2021.\n\nBefore she died she said, *“Share it only when you feel the person will honor the love in it.”* I took that as: it stays in the family kitchen, not a storefront window.\n\nFast-forward: my cousin “Lydia” (30 F) just launched an artisanal cookie shop. She DM’d me:\n\n1. She wants Brown-Butter Pecan Clouds as her **signature item**.\n2. She’ll credit Nana on the menu (“Nana Rose’s Clouds”) and give me free cookies for life.\n3. She claims using the recipe would “keep Nana’s spirit alive” and “help pay back” Nana’s medical bills (Lydia’s donating 5 % of profits to hospice).\n\nI told her I’m not comfortable turning Nana’s memory into a product. Lydia blew up:\n\n* Said I’m “gatekeeping flour and butter.”\n* Accused me of “hoarding clout” because friends beg me to bring the cookies to potlucks.\n* Warned she’ll “reverse-engineer” the recipe anyway. (Spoiler: she hasn’t gotten close—she posted a TikTok taste-test and commenters said hers were “sad pancakes.”)\n\nNow extended family is split:\n\n* **Pro-Lydia camp (mostly entrepreneurs):** Nana would *love* seeing her name in lights; refusing is selfish.\n* **Pro-me camp (mostly older relatives):** Recipe was Nana’s love language, not a revenue stream; keep it special.\n\nMy dad suggests a compromise: license the recipe with a binding contract that Lydia donates a fixed amount to hospice each quarter and doesn’t mass-produce it for grocery shelves. Lydia says contracts “kill creativity” and called me a “corporate stooge.”\n\nI’m starting to feel like I’m clutching pearls over *cookies*, but part of me thinks once the recipe goes public, it can’t be unseen. Nana never said *never*, but she did stress *care*. Lydia thinks I’m crushing her dream launch.\n\n**AITA for saying no?**",
