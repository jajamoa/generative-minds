I have an infant and every time one of those shells goes off overhead she tosses and turns. Not to mention my wife's ptsd. Why do people need several days of this?\n\nEdit: Sounds like things have just now recently finally quieted down. About a good 10 to 15 mins after our local noise ordinance kicks in. Also to everyone saying its \"just one day\" or \"it's Saturday\" I've been dealing with this since the 3rd. It's excessive. \n\nEdit2: I guess I'm a bit lucky to live where I do. The number of you all who are convinced there wouldn't be any response floors me. I mean, they obviously prioritize other things but complaints do get responses here. ",

Illegal fireworks all over the yard. They do not care. \n\nNTA. I have PTSD and often wish it would rain for forth of July. I'm fine with legal fireworks.

      "scenario_description": "Hi all, I (18F) am currently in my final year of high school and have been under a lot of pressure lately. I spend upwards of 5 hours on schoolwork every weekday and 9–10 hours on weekends to keep up with my final year coursework. I have chronic joint pain, and my specialist has warned that I’m at risk of permanent nerve damage if I don’t start pacing myself but rest has been difficult to come by.\n\nThere’s currently a lot of extra noise and responsibility in the house. My extended family recently went on a two-week overseas holiday, and my parents volunteered us to look after their pets while they’re away. (We didn’t go on the trip ourselves, because my parents felt I “should be using this time to study.”) So on top of our own animals, we’re now looking after two more large dogs and a bird that I am expected to help care for.\n\nThe bird has a habit of defecating in my drinks and screeching at all hours. I’ve been trying to make the best of the situation but I’d already been woken up at 4:30am by one of the dogs (which happens often), and I was in a lot of pain from overuse of my dominant hand.\n\nIn that moment, I cracked. I made a sarcastic and admittedly aggressive comment (something along the lines of “I’m going to rotisserie fry that bird and wash him down with dog blood”) not realising my mum was on the phone with my grandmother (the bird’s owner) at the time. She overheard and got very upset.\n\nI apologised later that day and clarified that I would never actually harm the bird, it was just a very ill-timed joke made out of frustration and exhaustion. But my family is still acting cold with me, and I’ve been told that lately I’m “acting intense” and owe further apologies. I feel like I’ve been trying to hold everything together for months under constant pressure, and now I’m being punished for having one outburst.\n\nAITA for what I said?\n",

Snowy was a white cockatiel and because they often inbreed them to get that color he was dumb as a rock. I loved him and felt bad for him but he made me crazy when I babysat because he would yell a lot. I used to threaten to put him in a teapot regularly. Mom actually heard me say that once and joked \"You're not going to turn the tea pot on, are you?\" I responded of course not and I wasn't even going to put him in a teapot but since he couldn't understand what I was threatening I didn't see the harm in the comment. Instead of loosing her shit on my for understandably being frustrated Mom helped me come up with things to help. We found out Snowy loved cartoons with music and listening to cheery music so I would put on Nickelodeon on tv or Disney Mania Cds and Snowy would sing along to them.",

      "scenario_description": "So I (25F) work as a temp at my city's parking authority office, selling parking permits to people. Not really relevant but I thought people might be curious. I also have IBS, which is actually relevant. So TMI warning, I guess, but everybody poops. So I have to use the bathroom a couple of times a day, and yes, it's number 2. I come into work a half an hour early just so I can guarantee I get fifteen minutes before I'm on the clock. I then spend half of my lunch break, which is only thirty minutes, in the bathroom, and usually go again about two hours before clocking in. Now, mind you, only two of these bathroom breaks are on the clock.\n\nI can't afford to be precious about where I use the bathroom. If I were the kind of person who could only use my own bathroom at home, I would also be pooping myself in public a lot (SPOILERS: I DO NOT POOP MYSELF IN PUBLIC). Well, the other day a coworker of mine noticed how often I use the bathroom, and how long I spend in there, and put two and two together that I'm going number two. Not that it's anyone's business, but she came up to me and told me it was gross to be pooping at work.\n\nThis isn't about taking too long, or using one of a limited number of stalls. There’s five individual bathrooms (one designated for men, one designated for women, three gender neutral) and usually no more than two at a time are occupied. So my using the bathroom barely affects anyone else except for the five to fifteen minutes total I spend in the bathroom during the work day. I also have coworkers who spend an extra twenty minutes on their lunch breaks and take frequent smoke breaks throughout the day, but because I happen to be performing a natural bodily function, I’m the gross one.\n\nI fully discounted this lady until he mentioned it to two other coworkers who were both equally judgy. I felt relatively comfortable in the stance that it’s normal to poop in bathrooms but now it’s three to one and I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t know if it’s a generational thing (everyone else is at least 40? Does that matter at all?) but I need to know: whether or not you personally feel comfortable pooping in public restrooms, does it make me a nasty freak because I do?",

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "My brother might see and recognize this but it is what is is. \n\n\nMy mom passed away last summer. I (24M) was the only one of my siblings (F, M, M, all a couple of years older) interested in her car, so I handled everything with my sister since she was the authorized representative. I waited through probate, paid the fee, and had it titled, registered, and insured under my name this April. No one had issues at the time. I now drive that car (call it the yellow car).\n\nI’ve also had my own car (the green car) since 2021. Both cars are worth ~$3-4k.\n\nA couple months ago, one of my brothers asked to borrow my green car for the summer. I agreed but told him up front I might try to sell it and would need it back for that. He said fine.\n\nFast forward to early July: a coworker was interested in buying it. On July 9, I texted my brother that a buyer might be coming. No reply. I texted again on the 11th to say I’d need it Monday or Tuesday. Again, no reply.\n\nToday, I texted him I’d come get it, and he blew up—saying the siblings need to be involved because I “got Mom’s car for free” and shouldn’t be selling my own car. He also claimed he didn’t see my texts because he was at a music festival Fri-Sun… but my first texts were from the Tues and Thurs before that, and he still managed to post to Instagram.\n\nHe sent some texts insulting my character, calling me selfish and saying I’d ruin my relationship with him and my sister “over money.” When I pointed out I warned him from the start I might need my car back, he went off with:\n\n“I’m literally offering you money to use your car, can you not read? If you think I’m guilt tripping you then you’re actually [r-word]. You clearly only care about yourself, hope ruining this relationship is worth it. Don’t talk to me ever again.”\n\n(Also—he only mentioned possibly buying when we first talked 7 weeks ago, never responded about it again until today, after he was already insulting me.)\n\nI went and picked up my car from my other brother’s place (where brother in question is staying after quitting his job last year to travel). Found three empty weed pens in it—so apparently he was driving my car high.\n\nNow I’m planning to go low/no contact for a while and not let him borrow anything of mine again.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My mother hasn’t spoken to me for 2.5 months (not a single word) despite us living in the same house because I told her she was selfish. She went out and bought something (which she took from me) without even thinking about asking me if I needed some. She claims I was rude to her because I said “you bought it because it was on sale but didn’t even cross your mind to ask me if I needed some, that’s real nice of you”\n\nDespite this, I’m trying to do something nice for her. Her car (which my sister and I bought for her about 4 years ago) currently is broken down, she needs to take it to the garage and because she doesn’t work (hasn’t done so in 15 years for no real reason) doesn’t have money to pay to get it fixed.\nMy dad (her ex husband) has a car he told me he’s planning to sell, I immediately thought of her. I told him not to sell it and I’d come get it. It’s a 2015 Nissan Qashqai, not the most fancy car but decent and far better than what she currently has. I’ve paid 1200£ to get a few things fixed with the car and planning to drive 2.5 hours each way to get it for her. My sister told her and her first response was to say she doesn’t need our help and then to say the car was not good enough for her. She started asking does it have leather seats because she wants material, she doesn’t want to take on a crap car, she would rather a Mercedes and doesn’t like the look of SUVs…then my sister said maybe she should consider talking to [me]because I’m doing something nice for her, and she flipped. She said she didn’t ask me to and she won’t give up her “self respect” by talking to me…\n\nI truly don’t feel like I own her an apology. And after all of this I feel like I need to move out and start distancing myself which I never thought I’d say \n\nShe does stuff like this a lot.\nTwo months ago she wanted a new TV and rather than getting a decent Tv for £500~ she said that wasn’t good enough for her and was set on getting a £1600 TV. I told her it was irresponsible to use that much money on a TV considering she has not a penny to her name, my autistic brother has not a penny to his name and there’s so much he needs and her mother is stuck in another country, poor. And she made it seem like I was terrible for not wanting her to have something good. I borrowed her the money to get the TV she wanted. She does not work and most appliances in the house are broken and when I/we have offered to help her new ones, (mid range) she always kicks up a fuss about and says they aren’t good and she’d rather keep her old broken one if she’s not getting the best branded appliances \n\nI will add my mum fell into depression after having my brother. Than his autism. But it’s been 16 years. I’ve tried hard over the last 3 years to get her help. She sleeps till about 1pm every day and makes the biggest deal when you ask her to do the tiniest thing. I even tried going with her to the GP to start therapy for depression. She never followed through. ",

Without going into too many details I recently gained some weight resulting me to go from a s/m to a large and I’ve been struggling with it. My mum have made comments there and there about everything but recently it’s been about my weight and how now some of the dresses that she bought me don’t look as pretty. Tbh I normally would tell her to just leave it and just brush it off. \n\nBut today I just couldn’t. I was preparing some lunch for me and aunt who was visiting us and out of the blue my mum just blurts out how I am getting fat. I don’t know whether it’s just been a bad day or just these comments finally just got to me or simply if she said it to my aunt but I just snapped and just left to my room crying. I could hear my aunt confronting my mum about her comment and then my aunt came to my room stating how my mum is being ridiculous and something about how she just talking about how she just “small” - have no idea what does that refer to. My mum comes in later telling me to go eat and how she was just joking. I told her to leave and that’s when she told me that she will just never joke with me again and how I never act like this and blah blah (tbh I just tuned her out at one point).\n\nAm I being over dramatic? My mum said something about how what she told me was no different to some of the banter that me and my brothers share (stuff like being adopted and other stuff like that) so why am I annoyed about it. But I feel like it’s different hearing that ur fat from your parents compared to ur siblings, joking or not. Also I feel like she wasn’t joking cuz she told me this in the past. Idk I just feel like she playing this stance just because she was confronted. Idk what I want to do but I have just locked myself in my room just doom scrolling.\n\nAITA?",

I (30M) have a small apartment but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she’s six months pregnant. I wasn't very pleased about this situation but she is my sis afterall.\n\nThe main issue has been food. I’m pretty disciplined about what I eat because I am in bulk stage and hitting the gym regularly. I portion things, label them and plan for the entire week. But every other day something’s gone. Makes me crazy.\n\nShe’ll drink all my expensive shakes, polish off meals I’ve prepped for work, eat snacks I’ve saved for post run, and even finish leftovers I was planning to turn into new meals. When I bring it up, she shrugs and says things like “Cravings hit hard” or “Hormones” or \"You are being mean\".\n\nI asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. Or hell, manage her own food for god's sake. She refuses to do anything about it.\n\nSo last week I ordered a small mini fridge and set it up in my bedroom. It’s just big enough for my meal prep, snacks and drinks. I didn’t make a scene about it. I just quietly started putting all my stuff there.\n\nShe noticed two days later and got pissed. She said I was being “childish,” “dramatic” and “treating her like a thief.” I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights.\n\nNow she’s sulking and has told our parents after her failed marriage, her brother is also alienating her. And she is just a burden for everyone. My mom called and said I should “pregnancy isn’t easy” and especially for her situation.\n\nI don’t think I’m being cruel. I’m still letting her live here rent-free, and I’ve even offered to order food or cook together, but I just want my food to be left alone. A part of me understands she is going through trouble. But, at my expense?\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I recently found an monopoly game that is in bad shape.The box itself has rips along the edges and is taped up so that it doesn't fall apart, the board is taped up aswell and even though it has been \"fixed\" the rips cause the figures to tip over on some fields.The figures themselves are falling apart, too. The print is all smudged and on some figures, the face is completely missing because of excessive usage. They also fall out of the little plastic foot, which we \"fixed\" by putting tissue paper in the little slit where you put the figure in so that it hopefully doesn't fall apart during the game. The money is also disgusting, all sticky and crunched up and the cards are torn an crunched up aswell. The only part of this game you could still use are the dice and the houses. Everything else just screams \"please throw me away\". Because my parents bought me this game and I live with them and can't just throw something as big as a board game away without them noticing, I told them that I wanted to throw it out, because 1. it is disgusting and hardly usable anymore and 2. we've played it like a thousand times, so it's not like it was a waste of money.My parents got really angry and told me that some \"poor children that have nothing to play\" (where we live, there are no children like that and also the game is 13+ because it has bars instead of railway stations and weird stuff written on the cards like \"pay 50 bucks because you've got a yeast infection\") and that \"my generation doesn't care about others at all and just wants to throw everything away\" They want me to bring it to this book exchange box that we've got here and I would've done that if the game wasn't falling apart but in this condition, the first person who sees it will throw it away, but I would at least keep the houses and the dice because these are literally the pieces that are missing in our old monopoly, that is otherwise in good condition. I think that my parents are part of the problem why charities here only take new stuff anymore because they just give away trash and act as if someone who doesn't have a lot of money would be grateful.They always try to guilt trip me when I want to throw away old, used stuff that is just not usable anymore. They always tell me that they wasted their money on it if I throw it away, no matter how often I used it. What annoys me even more is the fact that if they get something second hand for free, they always expect it to be in near-mint condition and are angry at the person that gave it away if it is in bad shape.I hate that my parents act as if I'm ungrateful because I want to reuse what still can be used and throw away what's not usable anymore instead of \"donating\" it to feel better about myself. I even showed them how bad it looks and they really looked at that board that is ripping more and more each time you unfold it and said \"yeah, a child (again, this game is NOT for children) will want that and love it more than you probably ever did\" AITA?",

I Deliver Newsletters as Mini Job and she is a waitress in a Restaurant so our work time is really different. I have a Problem with her since she is avoiding every Single Chore in the houshold. For Information, both of our parents have a sight Walking disability. My Father (51) has a Bad hip from Football and working and is a shift worker in a factory and my mother (49) has a Bad leg and is unable to work because of a grave car accident a few years back. So we are supposed to help them out in the house, wich for me is no problem even if I dont like it sometimes. But my sister is my problem. She does Not help at all. She does t Do dishes, laundry or takes the trash out and when I ask her to help with something she snarks at me and tells me to do it myself. She works 2-3 Times a week besides school but has time on the other days. But then she purposly goes out, goes drinking every weekend at a Friends and sleeps there and often time does t come back Till sunday evenings. The chores still need to be done so its always me who has to do the kitchen or the vacuuming or sweeping. It's been like that for Months and I tried talking to her multiple Times but it only got worse Now that we have summer Break. She sleeps Till 1-2 pm, eats something and holes herself Up in her room and is on her phone all day. We also have a dog wich is our responsibility but she does t full Up his water or food or grooms him (He's a long hair and we have summer) and only walks him in the evening. When I try to talk to her about helping more with chores she gets really defensive saying that she does enough already and when I then Start listing Things that I did that week and ask her when the time was that she took the trash out or did the kitchen she yells at me to stop playing the victim and Not to annoy her. I'm at the end. I tried talking with her again today and she did the same Thing and I snapped. I told her that if she is t doing anything anyways that she should Just move out since it's Not like it would affect as and she got all Mad and is not talking to me anymore. I dont feel Bad about What I said. I'm tired of always being her punching bag when she has a Bad mood (wich is often) and to get treated really Bad by her. Even our parents noticed and told her to talk normally to me or that she could Do more since I'm doing more than her already,but she is not Listen Ing to the. I'm at the end, What should I Do? Sorry for the long rant! ",

She got mad and told me I'm grounded until I move out for college. \n                           I thought this was so unfair, so I told my dad Chris (44m). My dad said my mom was ridiculous, and that she'll talk to her. Now my parents are having this massive fight and I think their marriage maybe in trouble. Am I the asshole ?",

Right now, none of his employees are in the country where I’m studying.\n\nAn hour ago he called me, asking me to go get 400000 euros from some guy and transfer it to him in a sketchy exchange company that they work with, I refused because on the first hand it is A LOT of money to take responsibility of and on the other hand it feels kinda illegal?\n\nNot to mention the fact that I don't work in their company, Over the past year, they’ve occasionally asked for favors like this, saying if I helped out “just this once,” they’d offer me a real job eventually, but that never happened. So, I’ve started feeling taken advantage of.\nAnd it's not like they are just completely unable to transfer the money in this week, they can, the company has a lot of employees and is rich enough to gain this amount of money per week from this country alone. In classic corporate fashion they are just trying to use me to cut their expenses as much as possible.\n\nObviously my dad got upset from my refusal and told me to call him when I change my mind, and it's not the first time I've been treated like this, I was raised in a household where I should have listened to my parents or else, so i cant help but feel I'm being a ass here and should just do what he wants from me.\n\nSo am I the ass hole here and should just do what my parent expect of me or I was right to stand my grounds.",

I get along well enough with her new husband, he's a cool guy in general, treats me and my mother well. He also has a 13 year old daughter from a previous relationship, as he's been married and divorced his ex. They have a 50/50 custody split of their daughter. \n\nDuring the wedding on Saturday, everyone had fun, I even shed some tears of joy for my mom. But Sunday, something shifted. My cousin asked if I am going to call my mom's new husband dad. I obviously said no. I already had a dad and was a fully grown woman by the time he came into my mother's life. \n\nAfter that comment, my mother and her sister pulled me aside, and started yelling at me to stop bringing up my father in front of her new husband because... he's jealous? Of a dead man? His ex is alive and they see each other every other weekend to pass the kid but he's jealous of a dead man? I basically told them to get off me. That I do not do it deliberately but my father had been my father for 20 years and naturally I bring him up sometimes in passing. Especially to my younger cousin who was only 7 when my dad passed away and barely remembers him.\n\nMy aunt went into a whole tangent how \"my dad was important to me but is not important to anybody else anymore and I should let go and move on instead of talking about him because everyone else is.\" That, in turn, made me cry and I didn't speak to either of them for the rest of the day.\n\nAITA for bringing up my dad sometimes? Is it reasonable of my mother's husband to be jealous of a literal corpse..?",

      "scenario_description": "I 19F have a cat that I’ve had for over a year. I’ve had some hardships that lead me to moving into my grandparents house a few months ago. At the time it was my cousin, her boyfriend, and my adopted uncle. I took the time to get my cat acclimated to everything and made sure I did everything within my budget to make sure she was healthy and happy. Time had passed, my cat began to get comfortable. Soon after my dad 44M got broken up with and moved in to my grandparents. He caused a huge rift in everything regarding why he got broken up with. He took over the living room, was always yelling about something or yelling at someone, and listening to loud music, which made my cat regress in progress getting comfortable here. My cousin and her boyfriend moved out after he had came here, leaving me with my uncle and my dad (I don’t blame them.) He would not only be loud to the ears but also the nose. He is a weed smoker, which I wouldn’t care about, but he would do it excessively in the house, making it stinky and smoky all hours of the day and night. After about a month, things settled down and my cat began to get more comfortable, and more comfortable being out in the living room, which made me really happy, until it didn’t. He is still smoking excessively but also with my uncle and my cat is in the room, I had asked my dad to not smoke with her in the room, and he brushed me off. I asked a second time, and he reacted like a child and didn’t talk to me for a few days. He has a book shelf covering the entrance to the living room, and I had opened it slightly while he was sleeping because my cat kept bothering me while I was trying to sleep so I opened that for her, so she could get comfy in there. He woke up sometime after noon and asked me if I had opened his door, I said yes and explained my cat, and with an attitude said, “Oh so now she’s allowed to be in here.” In what world are YOU mad at ME for wanting the best for my cat. He has also somehow used my closeness with my cat, with me in an argument, calling her my “little toy” when I feel like I’m the only one looking out for her well being. My uncle began to get closer to my cat making her want to be out there more while they are smoking, giving her treats, food, ect. My uncle began to feed her which I wasn’t really cool with because I had her on a feeding schedule that aligned with my work schedule. He feeds her wet food, awesome, cool, but not when left out for hours and not being refrigerated. My uncle has his own cat, it’s not like he’s missing out on the cat experience or whatever. I just feel like the both of them want to be authority and perceived as responsible, even though, they don’t scoop her litter, they obviously don’t care about her enough to not smoke in front of her. Im the only one who buys useful groceries. Im the only one with a job. Im not sure why it just makes me very upset them playing pretend with my cat trying to be responsible but being even more irresponsible. AITA?",

      "post_title": "AITA for wanting an apology for an event that happened years ago?",
      "scenario_description": "I (26F) still feel hurt about something that happened when I was around 15–16. Back then, my family was living in Germany (military) and my mom (46) planned a detailed weeklong trip to Italy for our family of five, plus my cousin. Italy was close by and is my favorite place in the world, so I was excited based on vague mentions that it would happen “sometime in the summer\" (which typically means when school is out... right?). But I was never given actual dates or any concrete info, no mention of it at dinner, no family meeting called, it wasn't even on the family calendar which usually had everything from big trips like this to dentist appointments.\n\nI was the only one in high school at the time, so I was the only child with a schedule that really mattered and I had a major AP project due right at the end of the school year. Four days before the trip, my stepdad casually asked if I had packed yet, that was the first time I realized this trip was actually happening *then*. By that point, it was too late. I couldn’t go without tanking my grade, because part of the assignment included presenting it in class.\n\nThis came up again recently, and it turned into a three-day argument. All I want is a real apology from my mom for not telling me, just a simple “I’m sorry I didn’t let you know when I should have\" and this would not have been as dragged out as it has been. Instead, she offered vague apologies like “I’m sorry your schedule felt overlooked, I'm sorry it didn't fall on your timeline” and focuses more on how hard it was to plan a trip for six people.\n\nI’ve acknowledged how much she took on and how little help she had from her husband (who should have been more involved), I get that coordinating everything was a huge task. But I don’t understand how telling me somehow didn’t make the cut with all that effort she put into planning. Part of planning a big trip is making sure everyone involved knows about it... right?  \nShe packed bags for everyone else. Everyone else knew in advance. I was the only one blindsided. If I knew just a full week before leaving I would have been able to go because I would have had actual time to prepare, finish my project, and work something out with my teacher in regards to presenting that didn't seem like I was just asking for an extension due to poor time planning.\n\nTo me, it’s not about holding a grudge or wanting to rehash the past. It’s about wanting her to take real ownership of the fact that she didn’t communicate something important without trying to defend it. Instead, she seems to think that her stress at the time should excuse the oversight completely.\n\nSo Reddit—**AITA for still wanting a direct apology all these years later?**\n\nEdit: There was a plane ticket in my name. But like everything else here, I never knew it existed.  \nI ended up staying with a family friend since they would have gotten in trouble with the military for leaving me alone in the house for longer than a couple days.\n\nUpdate: I asked my stepdad what he remembered about this. Initially, he thought that I was told about the trip and just didn't pack for it. After knowing that I was never told, HE offered an apology. So there is some closure there. Its nice to finally hear from SOMEONE \"im sorry you never knew, that was messed up\" which is all I really needed.",

There is this one girl in my class, we don't really talk with each other, but i see her regularly because she lives on my way home. Most of the time i catch up with her, but sometimes i stay behind her, cause i'm tired and don't want to cycle hard.\n\nSo one day after school i get called to an office, when i came in i saw my mentor and that girl sitting. I was really confused ofc, cause i don't know her that well so why was i there? Then my mentor said that that girl didn't feel safe when she was cycling home, because she thought i was stalking her and that she would appreciate if i changed my way home. At first i laughed it off, thinking it was a weird kind of humor, but when they kept looking serious at me i said: 'Wait you're serious? ofc im not stalking her! Why would I? She lives on my way home and if i had to change my route back home i need to cycle way longer!' But my mentor made it very clear that she would take measures if i didn't change my route. Then i got really mad and said/yelled. 'Listen, I don't care what she does or where she lives, i don't stalk her! Why would i stalk her, I don't even have a crush on her. (at this moment i turned to girl) I don't have a crush on you, hell you wouldn't even be in my top 15!' At that moment she began to cry, i didn't know what to do, so i walked away.\n\nNow i get why se may think i was stalking her, and it is a little creepy to get followed by a guy as a girl. And i made her cry when i said that she wasn't even in my top 15. I get that a lot of girls are insecure about their bodies and i may made her insecurity worse.

I kinda snapped and yelled at her for a minute because I was so shocked and angry that \nshe would disregard our daughters safety like that.\n\nShe got defensive and said he would have been disappointed if she told him he couldn't come with them and our daughter liked not being in a booster seat, I told her it was better to disappoint one child then put another in danger and our daughter is 9 she isn't old enough to make this decision on her own. \n\n\nMy ex left upset and has since sent me some angry text messages and her husband sent me one to saying I way overreacted. \n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I feel insane even asking this but anyway, I will try to explain both views neutrally - some context: I (34) have a big fluffy cat who, for the most part loves to be brushed, the only issue is her chest hair; my husband (30) is quite stressed at the moment for a few reasons that are all valid (the details of those reasons are not relevant to this). \n\nLast night I was sitting on the floor brushing said cat, and there’s are knots/mats (small ones) in her chest hair, so I started chatting to her while I brushed - I don’t remember the exact words but something like “are you going to let me get these out or do I need help? Will you be a good girl or is this a two man job?”. I was speaking quieter than conversational volume as she was right in front of me. \n\nMy husband, laying on the couch, says - in what I heard as an accusatory tone - “I’m feeling really stressed, can you please not do that?” *insert my confused face* “I’m trying to relax can you please not ask me to do anything right now?” \n\nI honestly didn’t know what he was talking about at first, until he gestured to the cat. \n\nI said I wasn’t talking to him and hadn’t asked him to do anything. \n\nHe says he is the only other person in the room so it was logical to infer I was talking to/about him. \n\nThis turned into a whole argument because \na) he wanted me to apologise that what I said upset him (not sure if upset if the right word) but, \nb) I refused (initially) because his assumption that I was talking to him is what made him upset - in my mind, he did it to himself. \n\nIn the end I said “I’m sorry that what I said to the cat upset you”, he said that felt like a dig, I said that’s the apology I am comfortable with. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

While you were talking to the cat (I'm voting not he first time) and your husband should have understood that (You said to be a good girl and let me get these tangles out; both of which would indicate you don't mean him) I can understand if he was stressed and heard the part about you needing help and assumed you were going to possibly ask him for help. I have a cat who is great about brushing tangles out. My Mom has a cat that is normally sweet but will remove the tips of people's fingers if they are dumb enough to annoy her!\n\nIt might have been better if you had clarified you were speaking to the cat and added that he didn't need to worry about helping because it was going well. Since animals can't completely understand what we are saying I often use empty threats sarcastically while working with animals; especially my parents. My favorite threat with my Mom's husky is that if he doesn't behave I'm going to dye him purple. That is not something I ever do... it just makes me feel better saying it. My tone (which is better on animals anyway) says clearly that I have to do this and it will go better if he cooperates but I'm not going to give up even if he doesn't cooperate.\n\nYou can be sorry your husband was upset and stressing about possibly having to help groom a cat without specifically apologizing for doing anything wrong (which you didn't do.). I say I'm sorry for things like that all the time. I'm sorry the bad drivers stressed my Uncle out. I'm sorry the specialist assigned to my cousin isn't responding to her in a decent time frame. I'm sorry that bad things happen and people have to deal with them. It doesn't make me responsible for any of it... I just feel sorry that the people I care about are having a hard time.",

      "scenario_description": "I'm 25M and work at a gas station. Standard cashier and obviously I have to deal with customers. This particular customer I cannot STAND and actively treat him differently from others, why? It's because of the way he talked about my younger cousin. It was a while back when he did this, she was walking out of the store and and he said some.. pretty disgusting things how he'd \"tear it up\" yknow, gross things about \"how good she looks\" and \"what he'd do\" this obviously set me off, because A. He knows her mom, he watched her grow up. And B. At the time i thought she was only 16 (i was wrong shes 18). Still thinking shes 16 I told him she was only 16 and he wanted to argue me down saying no shes 18 over and over and I kind if brushed him off at the time saying something like \"Sure dude\" trying to stay calm. He even came back and said \"Hah! I told you she was 18!\" Like this was supposed to be a kind of.. gotcha moment? Again I brushed him off wanting to keep my job. (Of course I also told my younger cousin about this cause this was really freaking gross) eversimce then I've actively treated him different. More cold, less friendly, not replying when he greets me just enough to let him know I Don't like him, but not enough to risk my job.\n\nHere's where I think I might be the Ahole. A bit ago he came to my store again and I did the usual thing of being cold. Pretty sure he's picked up on it and he kind of directly asked why am I being so cold to him. And I kind of? Crashed out a bit. I told him he was gross, how nasty it is to talk about women in general the way he did but especially a young girl he's like 68 or something and my cousin is ONLY 18. I also told him how pathetic he is for talking like that and that we are not on friendly terms and that I'd rather him not speak to me and to just get the 3 beers he always gets and fucking leave. He kind of froze there. Like a deer in headlights .. and all he said was \"I'm sorry\" and \"It was just guy talk\" or whatever. I'm a guy and I get like the occasional oh that person is good looking or wow I'd like to take then out type stuff and maybe MAAAYBE being a tad bit explicit I'm no angel. But this was just.. gross... anyways that's the jist of what happened. AITA for being cold to a customer? \n\nTL;DR customer being gross to a younger family member of mine and I got mad. \n\nFormatting weird cause on mobel etc. etc.\n\nEdit: to be more specific I feel likeni may be an ass for going off on him in such a public setting and maybe could have done this privately? I dunno just feel a bit bad for going off on him.",

      "scenario_description": "Me (29 F) have been with my partner (33 M) for about a decade now. Although I enjoy the sentiment of a surprise decorated bedroom, flowers, or gift - I absolutely hate surprise parties. Is that too high of an expectation for my partner? \n\nToday is my 29th birthday with the same partner. I am preparing for a very important board examination, of which I am on my 4th attempt out of 5 (everything is riding on this exam), and it is next week. I have been very clear with my partner what kind of support I need from him. I have myself on a strict lock-down schedule of just studying, 1.5 hour afternoon walk, and grocery runs ONLY. It has been this way for the last month. I also have complex-PTSD and live daily with a loud self-critic consciousness (yes, I am seeing a therapist weekly for this and yes, my partner knows this - I debrief with him after every therapy session). We discussed my birthday plans. Since it has been a long time since I have been able to put makeup on and dress up, I was looking forward to my birthday dinner (so much). I picked out an outfit, a makeup look, press-on nails I wanted to wear. I told him, the day before my birthday, I am going to study all day so that I can feel accomplished and enjoy my actual birthday - with no self-hate of not deserving. HE KNOWS THIS.\n\nI am studying peacefully at home as I am waiting for his return. I call him and he immediately starts acting suspicious. At this point, I feel it in my gut that he is planning something. I almost want to tell him PLEASE DON'T HAVE A SURPRISE PARTY... but I don't because I know whatever he is planning, he has already been working on it for the last 3 hours. I already feel bad at this point. We end up going to the brother's house because he \"forgot something\". Ofc, I am grateful but I am also so upset. I ended up wasting the rest of my day surrounded by people who I am not very fond of (his family). I am the surprisee, I can't just say \"ok thank you but I have to go home now.\" - NO. I sit there. Waiting for my partner to wrap it up. He never does. I propose a suggestion: \"Oh remember we were going to go to the mall. Should we go now?\"\n\nToday is my bday. I am triggered to the point where I can't even study. I am so upset, to the point where I no longer have anything nice to say. I have expressed again and again, that I need to LOCK-IN and study but he just keeps playing games, encourages me to play with him. Keeps going out, encourages me to go out with him. I told my therapist I am tired of being stuck, her response is that one day, I am going to wake up and want to change. I want to change. I know he was just trying to make me feel loved but it was so poorly executed and we already had a clear plan. This surprise was last minute (I know because he told me) and poorly executed. I got an ice-cream cake on a flavor I didn't even ask for - AITA!!! I already had a plan to navigate the mean parts of me. I want to bitch at him but I need to hear everyone's thoughts first.",

      "scenario_description": "I (F28) recently lost a fair bit of weight and now my friend (F30) is saying I’m trying to upstage her at her wedding. My best friend “Emily” got engaged at the end of last year and asked me to be a bridesmaid, I was super happy and of course said yes. \n\nIn the past 3 years I have put on some weight, about two dress sizes, it didn’t really bother me until recently so I decided to use the wedding as an excuse to loose some weight. I just find it easier to do if I have a goal and end date.\n\nThis past weekend we were bridesmaid dress shopping and Emily was acting kind of weird towards me, giving me funny looks and talking over me. The two other bridesmaids (one I’m friends with the other I don’t know very well) didn’t seem to notice so I brushed it off thinking she was just stressed. \n\nMe and Emily live really close to each other so usually after something like this we would hang out for the day at one of our houses. At the end of the appointment I asked her who’s house she wanted to go to and she scoffed and told me she was going home. I asked what was wrong and this is when she went off on me. \n\nI don’t remember word for word what she said because I was so confused and shocked. But these are the bits I remember- she basically said it was clear I was trying to loose weight to upstage her for her wedding, that I was already “the skinny friend” and now I’m just trying to make it all about me especially as I never cleared my weigh loss with her. She said I clearly knew what I was doing was wrong because I was still wearing oversized clothes to disguise my weight loss - I just haven’t updated my wardrobe and prefer to be comfortable over wearing tight fitting stuff. \n\nI don’t consider myself skinny but I am the smallest out of the four of us, I also didn’t think about how changing my appearance would affect her vision for her wedding. I’ve never been a bridesmaid before so I don’t know if that was something I should have considered? \n\nSo I don’t think I’m the AH for loosing the weight - unless I am? \nBut AITH for not telling her I was going to loose weight? \n\nEDIT: guys I now know it’s LOSE I’m sorry for my dyslexia, I would go and edit all of them out but 1. I have been told there are many I’m too lazy for that and 2. I now think it’s hilarious how annoying you all seem to find it \n\nUPDATE:\nFirst off thanks for all the support as well as all the spelling lessons they have cheered me up a lot.\n Not sure if anyone wanted an update but you’re getting one anyway. \nI called my my friend as I’m currently away for work so couldn’t meet face to face. \n\nSpoiler, it did not go well. \n\nI started by telling her it was not my intent to make her feel any kind of way and tried to explain I had already been on my weight loss journey before she got engaged. I asked her if she really thought that I would be vindictive enough to try and upstage her at her wedding. Apparently this was the wrong thing to say. \nShe started ranting about how I think I’m better than her, how whenever we go out together no one ever looks at her only at me. (I don’t think this is true as she is very pretty and I’m pretty average looking). \n\nHere’s where it gets bonkers bananas. She told me that her ex boyfriend (who recently got married) is going to be at the wedding and for a while he was thinking of leaving his (at the time) fiancé to ask me out but my friend convinced him not to. \nI had no idea any of this went on and would have been appalled because 1. That’s just weird and 2. He’s my best friend’s ex and I’m now pretty sure she’s still in love with him. \n\nI have been uninvited from the wedding “unless I put the weight back on, then I can come but not as a bridesmaid” \nSafe to say I now have a new motivation to keep the weight off and shall not be attending any weddings in the near future. \n\nShe’s always had a temper and has flipped out at me over random stuff before but nothing ever this insane. I guess I’m going to have to get better at identifying red flags. ",

      "scenario_description": "My parents are divorced.  My sister is turning 42 and my mom and dad want to each have dinner with her for her birthday, resulting in the need for two separate celebrations on different days.  My wife and I have a six month old baby and each of my parents expect us to be there at each celebration.  My dad lives an hour away, my mom lives 20 minutes away, and I’m so exhausted from working, celebrating Fourth of July, taking care of the baby, doing light construction around our house, etc. and I haven’t had a day off to recover for the last month from various activities.  I’d rather just go to the closer dinner at our mother’s and skip the one at my dad’s since it’s a longer drive.  I have another event planned for the day after that as well, and I’m already exhausted.  My sister wants me to drive her to my dad’s, and when i told her I was thinking about just going to one birthday dinner, she didn’t respond and I assume she’s upset (the AC in her car isn’t working and we live in southern CA).  Please bear in mind my dad never does anything for my birthday, I’m lucky if I get a text from him, and my sister never does anything for my birthday, either.  Am I the asshole for choosing to only go to the one birthday dinner?  \n\nEdit: thank you all for your input and comments.  I feel validated and I think I need to be better at setting boundaries for myself.  For added context, the two birthday thing is a result of my sister not wanting to have both of my parents together because of the palpable animosity between them, which I understand, and also my dad and sister  didn’t talk for 7 years after my parents divorce so I think he puts some more effort into doing stuff for her.  I’m kind of the peacekeeper in the family but I need to get comfortable with disharmony if thats the result of taking time for my wife and daughter.  ",

While reading classics is great (I have a bunch of those too) sometimes you want light reading. Same with movies. I like watching deep & thoughtful movies but sometimes I'm not in the mood for Saving Private Ryan or My Sister's Keeper and I just feel like watching a summer blockbuster where I can enjoy the cool special effects and let me brain partly shut down. Just like I like to read classics as well as romance. What's wrong with McDonald's now and then, lol.\n\nYour aunt should be grateful her daughter is reading.

      "scenario_description": "I (35f) have been with my husband Hank (38M) for 17 years and married for 12. We have 2 kids, Ruby (8F) and Lily (1F). Since the start of our relationship, H's mother Bev has been rude to me. On more than one occassion while she called me to verbally abuse me about some perceived slight that is either nothing to do with her or didn't even happen, for example celebrating my nephew's birthday in person with him (he lives an hour away) a week after we didn't celebrate hers with her (she lives 14 hours away).\n\nBev has a substance use problem and also likes to call Hank when she isn't sober and blame him for things that have gone wrong in her life, even if they have nothing to do with him, like when she got a flat tyre and it was because he hadn't called her in a few weeks. I wish I was making this up, apparently it was because he didn't care about her and so the universe was out to get her. He has gone NC with her in the past but eventually he starts taking her calls again.\n\nA few years ago she told him that our child (only Ruby at that point) should never have been born. At that point I was adamant that Bev would never have anything to do with Ruby, but eventually conceded that their contact could just be limited and supervised, as it was important to Hank. I also stated that Bev had to be sober for any and all interactions. It has been easy enough due to the distance and the fact that Bev won't travel to see us and we haven't really been able to travel in the past year. \n\nA few weeks ago, Bev called and Hank let her speak to Ruby on loudspeaker. I overheard and could tell that Bev was at least drunk, she was slurring her words and making some passive aggressive comments that hopefully went over Ruby's head. After Ruby went to bed I spoke to Hank about it and asked why he let her speak to her when she wasn't sober and he said he didn't realise, and that nothing she said was all that bad. We talked some more and he admitted that he didn't want conflict and she was adamant about talking to Ruby, and he thought it would be ok as she hadn't been nasty on that call.\n\nI told him I was no longer comfortable with Bev having any contact with Ruby because I don't feel like my boundaries were respected and I can't protect Ruby if the rules aren't followed. To his credit, he agreed with me and hasn't even attempted to let Bev talk to Ruby since. But a friend asked me how I would feel if Hank told me that my parents could never speak to Ruby again and now I'm questioning it. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My girlfriend’s father had a business which was started by his great grandfather back in the 50s and passed through to different members of his family. His father eventually ended up being sole owner after buying out the others. The last person he bought out was his brother to whom he paid about $20,000 back in the early 80s. This business did not generate much money so he left it to become a grocery store manager while renting out the commercial property.\n\nWhen he passed, he left the property to his wife, my girlfriend’s mother. She’s (the mother) has been receiving rent, about $2800 a month, but it’s barely enough to cover taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. In most years, she takes home around $5,000. She wants to sell it for about $350,000 and use the money to travel and see family then move into a retirement community. She’s not rich and is basically living off of social security and measly rental income. \n\nMy girlfriend asked my opinion since I’m experienced with land and property so I told her I thought the asking price was too low for a commercial property sitting on an acre of land in the middle of town. She said that’s what it’s worth according to their property tax. Apparently throughout the entire history of the property, the family had been using the tax assessment to determine the price of buying in and out of the business. I told her the tax assessment and property value are two different things so I sent my appraiser out and he came back with an appraisal of about $1.2 million. They were shocked and didn’t think that was an accurate price until they started getting offers after it was listed. After some bidding, they came to an agreement with a buyer for almost $1.5 million. The closing is next week.\n\nWhen their family found out, things exploded. Everyone who’s still alive thought they got ripped off for the past buyouts, some dating back to the 60s. They want their fair share of the selling price but that’s almost impossible because we’re talking about a dozen people with some owning half of the business at some point. Now the family her mother was wanting to visit are threaten to sue. It’s been stressful on my girlfriend and she’s taking it out on me. Last night she told me that things might have been better if I didn’t bring up the appraisal since all it did was tear her family apart.\n\n\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "Basically, my sister is going on a 2 week holiday in September and needs someone to look after her dog. She doesn't use kennels for a number of reasons and I have always looked after her dogs in the past when her and her boyfriend have gone away.\n\nSo, if I usually look after her dogs, what has changed?\n\nThe last time she went away and I had to watch her dogs would have been last year. At the time she had a 3 year old Rottweiler named Dexter and, our childhood dog, an 11 year old Yorkshire Terrier named Pudsey. This is fine, I used to live with both dogs when me and my sister lived with our parents; of course the yorkshire terrier since I was like 10 and the Rottweiler for a couple years before moving etc. Dexter was also our 3rd Rottweiler as a family so, I can handle the breed.\n\nSince then, Pudsey has passed away and I adopted a rescue; a 7 year old Cane Corso named Roxie who is a saint. Roxie and and Dexter have met a couple times now and they get along well enough that I was still willing to dogsit for her. I WASN'T LOOKING FORWARD TO IT because, well, Dexter is a hassle. He's massive for one (weighs about 60kg to Roxies 40kg) and has literally endless energy. Energy he constantly redirects towards Roxie now. It can get too much for her but, I have ways to separate them when needed. Just to give her space.\n\nThat was until she started seriously considering getting another dog. Not just any dog but a puppy... So, upon hearing this, I told her \"I am not watching 3 dogs, on my own. One of which is a 60kg handful, the other a puppy\". And I was very clear, I put my foot down and outright told her and told my mum that I am not doing that. She can either wait A FEW MONTHS to get a new dog or can find a kennel for them.\n\nWell, looks like they take me for a dickhead as she now has a new chihuahua puppy. So? Looks like she's finding a kennel. Except my mum is adamant that I will still dogsit and that it isn't a big deal. They think because I work from home that, I have all the time to; baby sit a puppy, make sure Dexter isn't assaulting Roxie, walk them? I can't not walk them, it's 2 weeks. I walk Roxie for about 90 minutes a day (in the cooler weather) and I can't walk her and Dexter together? Nevermind a puppy in the mix?\n\n\"Why doesn't you mum watch one of them\" In her defence, she works 2 jobs. On most days; she's out of them house from 8am to 8pm with a couple hours home in between. I see why she can't watch a dog on her own either. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN WATCH 3? What about our dad? Well, our parents don't live together and his work schedule is a little unconventional. He essentially spends a week at work, living in, and then a week at home. He also lives about 6 hours away from my sister and 3 hours away from me so, for a number of reasons, I am the ONLY option.\n\nI'm being made out as a bad guy as my mum holds all of the things she did for me in the 22 years since I was born.

      "scenario_description": "Posting from an alt to stay anon. My(F26) boyfriend(M24) Todd likes to make me cute videos for when I go on trips for work or vacation with friends, basically any time we're away from each other for more than a couple days. Recently I had to go on a business trip for like a week so he went all out and made a handful of vids for me. One video in particular was him interpretive dancing to Lady Gaga's Bad Romance, one of my fav songs. It is actually funnier than it sounds believe it or not. Little context, he was teasing me for how I go full stan when listening to og gaga. It really helped me get through the week and some very boring conferences I had to sit through as well. Anyways I get back home and I'm hanging out with my friends and they're asking me about the trip, and without thinking I tell them it kinda sucked to be away for so long but Todd helped me get through it. \"How?\" they ask. I felt kinda cornered so I starting explaining to them that he makes these videos for me, he made one special one for me etc etc. and it all sorta unraveled into me describing the gaga video. You can prob tell where this is heading. They insist on seeing the video. They give me shit until I just say fuck it and told them they couldn't tell him that I showed them. So I show them the video and they started making fun of him. They weren't just like laughing at it or enjoying the silliness of it but they're like meangirling the shit out of it and honestly making me upset. A week later me and Todd go to dinner with one of my best friends Grace(who saw the video) and her husband Mark who is also close with Todd, and I could tell they were both treating him differently. They seemed demeaning. Worse than that, so could Todd, and he was clearly he was pretty upset when we got home. Now I feel like I've at the same time violated my partners trust and atltered my friends perception of him, all while he has no idea of any of it. We've been talking about marriage and I feel like this could be something that could actually stand in the way of that, which would make this like the dumbest fucking thing to break up a healthy relationship over. I'n searching for ways to justify just moving forward without addressing this but it makes me feel more guilty than I already do.\n\nSo AITA for showing my friends his video?",

      "scenario_description": "\nLast semester I (F20) was placed in a group project with a guy (M19). We’ve had mutual friends and classes together since freshman year but never actually spoke until this group.\n\nOver time we got closer,studying together, helping with homework, he’d sometimes buy me food. He has a car and told me I could ask him for rides instead of Uber. I’d ask maybe once every 2–3 weeks. I started to think he liked me, especially when he’d try to stay on the phone longer or keep calling after I ended a convo, but he never said anything outright.\n\nI didn’t expect a deep friendship. male friends  have violated me before and told him that early on. I also told him I didn’t believe in love or relationships.\n\nOver summer break, I went back home and barely talked to him. Then a few weeks ago, he called saying he was coming to my city for my birthday weekend because of the 4th of July break. I asked why, and he said he also wanted to see his cousin and explore the city. I thought okay, cool, maybe he could help take birthday pics.\n\nLater he told me his cousin had moved from my city then asked for my address and if I’d feed him while he was here. That made me uncomfortable bc suddenly I was the main reason for the trip. He already booked a flight and Airbnb, and never asked my opinion on this \n\nHe sent me a whole itinerary: shopping, my fave restaurants, etc. I told him it felt like too much, but he said I didn’t get to decide what he did for me. He also said he wanted to vlog the weekend. I was so anxious I couldn’t sleep the night before he arrived, and I made sure to not to be too welcoming \n\nHe showed up vlogging outside my house. I asked him not to record where I live, and he said no one would care even if they saw it.\n\nA mutual friend (f19) paid him to buy me roses to match a dress she had earlier got me for birthday pictures. He ruined the  roses surprise by telling me.\n\nBefore we went out, I said I didn’t want to be vlogged. He said “if I’m vlogging, you’re vlogging too.” I told him to record the city, not me. At the store, he sneakily recorded me and posted it on his story . He handed me his card and said it was mine for the day but I refused.\n\nAfter shopping, he asked me to do a haul of what he got me. I said no. He asked again with the camera in my face. I said no again. Then he stopped talking to me. He didn’t buy the roses and went cold for the rest of the trip so I blocked him.\n\nTwo days later he texted that he left and wished I’d texted or called. I sent our friend a rounded estimate of what he spent on me, told her to give it to him. He sent it back. I sent it again and blocked payments from him. He said a real friend would’ve just talked. I didn’t reply. Blocked again.\n\nHe just bought a vlog camera but has no YouTube videos yet. So yeah… I kinda feel like the whole thing was more about his content than my birthday.\n\nAITAH for thinking that? He could’ve just sent me shopping money 🤷🏽‍♀️\n",

      "scenario_description": "For some context, I do admit his original criticisms were fair—especially since I live in his house rent-free.\n\nThe issue started when I left dirty dishes in the sink before going out of town for 5 days. I could have washed them—my shift was canceled, I played video games, slept in, went to the gym, and left at 1PM.\n\nEarlier in the week, he’d asked me to clean the guest bathroom I use, which I kept forgetting—again, fair. But here’s where I felt like saying something was warranted.\n\nWhen I got home from the airport, I saw the dirty dishes in grocery bags on my bed. Fair enough. While unpacking, he told me: “If you EVER pull some shit like that again I’m making you pay $300 dollars because that was extremely disrespectful” and added, “I get back home from work to start the weekend with that bullshit?” \n\nThen he offered me leftovers. While I was heating them up and sitting to eat, he reminded me I hadn’t cleaned the bathroom. He said it was going to be a scheduled monthly task now. I interpreted “scheduling” to mean I’d be told when, not “drop everything and do it now.” Not even a minute after turning on the TV, he stormed in, grabbed the remote, shut off the TV, and said “What part of ‘you still haven’t cleaned the bathroom’ don’t you understand”.\n\nSo I started cleaning, but I genuinely misunderstood. Apparently at 26, I should’ve known “Dude it’s been a week since I told you to clean the bathroom” meant “Don’t even eat before it’s done.”\n\nNow I didn’t handle my response well, but I tried to say, “I don’t think your attitude was fair earlier.” He exploded. He went off about how he was “letting the dishes thing slide” and was appalled I’d “shift blame.” I NEVER denied the original criticisms—just felt he went from 0 to 100 instantly.\n\nWhen I said I misunderstood, he said: “YOU SHOULD’VE LED WITH THAT,” and “You should’ve been modest and contrite, but instead you come at me and try say that I’m wrong for what I did.” He said he was justified in his “stern chastisement” and my “attitude” was uncalled for.\n\nThis morning he sent a few texts to do a few things. Apologize for not communicating better, tell me he exerts a lot of effort to make me a better person, that he loves me like a son, and solidify his position that I was wrong for  calling out his overreaction to my misinterpretation. And finally I need to listen to his guidance and that I need to learn how to take more accountability. \n\nHe then goes on to say that I’m lacking in discipline as well as responsibility as if I regularly put off his requests for me to do stuff around the house which I almost never do. He also says my misunderstanding of his statement doesn’t excuse my behavior? Like dude, i was telling you that it wasn’t fair to come at me like I’m some impertinent child that never listens then proceed to storm off.\n\nMaybe I’m just being immature, but I feel like he could’ve handled things way better. Then again… maybe I’m wrong.",

      "scenario_description": "Hi a little background I (f24) and my bf (m23) have not been seeing eye to eye on this and neither of feel like our side is a big deal. So my bf gets the tv, about 85% of the time, and it’s been that way our whole relationship. When he watches his shows or plays his video games I leave him alone for the most part. If I ever need something I ask if he can pause the show so I can talk to him. \n\nI’ve been watching a show mostly on my phone, but occasionally I will watch it on the tv. He talks through the ENTIRE thing. I wish I was exaggerating, every 10 seconds he has something to say. I feel I would be more okay with it if he was watching the show with me, but he’s half listening and only has negative commentary about my shows. It’s very rarely conversation worthy, like it’s just little jabs about the show or the people. So 1. How do you want me to converse with that? And \n2.Why would I want to hear that when I enjoy the show? And I actually know what’s going on. \n\nI’ve ask that if he wants to talk, I understand and I’m more than happy to talk, but if he could just pause the show or ask me to and I will. He has ignored this request over and over again. \n\nI typically won’t say anything, but then he gets mad at me for being frustrated even when I don’t say anything. Eventually I will cut my eyes or try to talk a deep breath and that will just send him into the worst mood all night. He will barely speak to me if I’m any ounce of annoyed with him. \n\nSo Reddit Am I the Asshole for asking for the tv to be paused?",

We have been discussing (arguing about) a name for the last 8 months and now I'm afraid there is going to be a tug of war at the hospital over the birth certificate.  Stylistically we want very different things. I like \"classic\" names. To give a few examples for a boy's name: Martin, Silas, Calvin. My husband prefers more unique names--he suggested both Artemis and Entrari from his favorite work of fiction. I don't want to name our child after a fictional assassin and he doesn't want to name his child after \"an old man.\" Combining one \"old man\" name with one \"unique name/fictional refernce\" seems to create a really wierd sounding combination and  we are both arguing over the first name anyway. I would love for this to be a \"one no two yes\" situation and for both of us to be happy with the child's name, but he hates every single name I suggest and I really don't care for any of his suggestions. I do feel as though I should have a little more influence over the name, if only because he automatically gets the child's last name, no questions asked. I told him that the child could have whatever name he picked out, on the condition that they get my maiden last name and he refused (I don't actually expect them to have my last name. I was just trying to express that I understand how important the last name is and I would accept his first name suggestion if I had the priviledge of automatically assuming the last name). I am getting less and less excited about the arrival of the child, because it is surrounded by disagreement after disagreement. I feel like I'm not getting to name the child something that means a lot to me, names that I have had in my notes app since I was in high school. He said that he doesn't want to sigh (out of distaste) every time he has to call out this child's name. Am I the asshole for really sticking to my guns when it comes to the child's name? Does anyone have any suggestions for compromise? ",

I would NEVER name a child after a fandom of mine because a child is their own person and not a reflection of my obsessions!!!",

We were inseparable, we went to each other's houses all the time (we lived right down the road from each other) and did almost everything together. Everything was amazing and it was just a great friendship until 6th grade hit. When we got into that school, he was completely different. He didn't respect my boundaries or my other friends boundaries and he got very controlling over me. He used to dig his nails into my thigh and pull my hair extremely hard if I said something he didn't like.\n\nI thought it was weird but I didn’t really question it because he was my best friend. Well, fast forward to the middle of the year, I wasn't really talking to Ricky anymore but we were still cool. One day he invited me to his house and I went over because he said that he was different and such. I was very wrong.\n\nWhen I went over, he had a pillow fort built in his room and told me to go inside. I didn't really question it because it was normal for the time. When we were in there, he got really weird and started asking really deep, uncomfortable questions. Then before I knew it, he kissed me and I froze. That was my first ever kiss that I NEVER wanted, especially not from him.\n\nI ran out of his house and cried as I ran home. When I went to school the next day, he started spreading really bad rumors about me and said terrible things about my family. He then left the school after that and I didn't talk to him again.\n\nWhen 8th grade came, I had to switch schools because I was getting bullied really bad at the other school. When I walked into my new school the first face I saw was Ricky's. From the first day that I was there, he was trying to give me notes and apologize but I ignored him. It got so bad that the principle had to tell him to stop.\n\nI kind of learned to coexist with him after that, trying to keep our interactions as short as possible. The year finished off as normal and everything was fine. But the second week into the summer, my family and I found a notebook with other notes attached to it in our fence. \n\nIt was a whole care package from Ricky. He had been writing in that notebook the entire year, writing about whenever I would look at him or answer a question he had throughout the entire year. He told me in there that he had been leaving stuff in my yard, hoping that I found them and kept them forever.\n\nHe was also begging me to take him back as his best friend and how he couldn't bare the sight of seeing me with other friends. Then as I continued reading, he made it seem like it was my fault for everything and that we would still be friends if I wasn't so difficult.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "\nMy (28F) boyfriend (36F) of 5 years waits until he has left for work to text me about whatever is on his mind regarding our relationship, but will give me the silent treatment that same morning when he wakes up. We live together and have for 3.5 years now. \n\nRight now, he’s mad because I said I’ll no longer make lunch for him since he has complained about the quality of them lately. Guess what? No one gives a fuck if I eat or starve, and I do all of the grocery shopping and bringing them (including the 5gal water refill up a whole flight of stairs) in and paying for them by myself, so why should I cook him lunch too? Making dinner is good enough. \n\nMy family home is being foreclosed on right now and he knows that I have been highly stressed, and I left a piece of raw onion in his lunch because I was distracted which is what started all of this. \n\n\nHe’s now saying I must not be happy with him because I’m not prioritizing him over my job, my family, etc. That I must be seeing someone else or don’t love him anymore.  I’m exhausted with going back and forth with him and ignored his texts today, because he sent the same sort of texts to me yesterday morning and I ignored them and he didnt say anything about it at all once I was home. \n\nDid I mention he has a 5 minute work commute and I have a 1.5 hr one EACH WAY? We make the same amount of money and I pay only $230 less towards the house than what he does. So I dont feel like that extra $200 a month entitles him to a home cooked meal for lunch and dinner every fucking day, OR to whine to me about it while I’m at work. \n\n\nAITA for telling him to not speak to me about relationship issues during work hours? He used to be upset about me not calling and talking or texting often while he’s at work, and I’ve explained countless times that I’m easily distracted and for me to succeed, I have to leave work time as work time. \n\nBesides… I dont even think I called my mom that often at work when I was a kid. We’re both only children so I don’t understand where he gets this from. If I try to play imessage games with him, thats not “what he means”, and my job is brain-power heavy so when I clock out for lunch I am a simple hungry zombie that cannot create entertaining discussion out of thin air that arent related to my job. \n\n",

      "scenario_description": "My sister does this thing where she'll just say something she wants with the expectation that someone will do it for her. For example, if she wants the AC turned on, instead of asking someone to turn it on for her, she'll keep repeating things like \"Oh, isn't it super warm in here?\", \"Does anyone else feel really hot?\" or \"I heard that today is a super hot day!\" and if someone asks her if she wants the AC on, she'll reply with \"No, no, I'm good! But if *you're* hot then you should turn it on!\"   \n  \nAnyways, last weekend it was my birthday so my family and I went out to celebrate. During the meal, she kept making comments implying that she wanted another cocktail, but wouldn't order it. The waitress even came by and asked if we needed anything, but she didn't order a drink even when we all did. I could tell she was agitated at that point, but it was my birthday so I just ignored her. \n\nWhen we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we \"let\" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying \"no\" to the waitress because her family should've \"taken care of her\" (her words, not mine). \n\nThe three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.
