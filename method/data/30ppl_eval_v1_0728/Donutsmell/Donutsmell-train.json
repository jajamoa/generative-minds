      "post_title": "AITA? I decided to sell a bedframe given by my mom that didn‚Äôt fit in my apartment",
      "scenario_description": "Hey y‚Äôall!\n\nSo basically, I (25M) recently moved in with my girlfriend (25F). We needed a bed frame, and after shopping around with no luck, it just so happened my mom‚Äôs landlord was giving one away.\n\nMy mom asked if I wanted it, and after confirming with the landlord, I accepted it. My mom and her fianc√©e helped deliver the bed to the garage at my new place. A week or so later we moved the rest of my stuff with movers, and we asked them to move it for us. They said it was too heavy and didn‚Äôt fit up my stairs. So, my friend and I tried to move it a few days later. Turns out, it IS extremely heavy and no matter how hard we tried, it did not fit up our stairs. In the mean time my mom had also gotten me a metal bed frame (despite me asking her not to), so we no longer needed the heavy one. Given we just moved and already had so much stuff to unpack, I decided I was going to sell it or trash it to make room. \n\nThis is where the fun begins. Long story short, I told my mom my decision to sell it or put it on the street, and it escalated into a huge argument. She claimed that since she got it for me that she had some decision making power and needed to be included in the process of what to do with it. She felt that by deciding to sell it or trash it without consulting her, I was disrespecting her relationship with her landlord AND treating her gift as trash. Not only that, she expressed that by excluding her from the process that I was causing her pain and not considering her feelings about the situation. \n\nIn my opinion, the bed frame was given as a gift - not from her, but from her landlord. Either way, it is up to me to decide what to do with it. I also asked the landlord separately, who told me he has no attachment to it and to sell it and keep the cash. My mom is claiming that I have no interest in understanding her feelings in not just this but ANY situation, and that I am hurting her by the way I went about the process. \n\nAITA? I am at a loss. I would give it back, but I am working on setting boundaries so I don‚Äôt want to give in to this situation. Please let me know what you think. \n\nThank you for any help you have to offer. ‚úåüèº\n\n\n\nTL;DR - my mom got me a bed frame from her landlord. When it didn‚Äôt fit and was too heavy, I decided to sell it. She was upset that I didn‚Äôt include her in the decision, and by choosing to sell it without asking, I was disrespecting her gift and all the efforts she went through to get it. Now she believes I don‚Äôt see her feelings in any situation. \n\nEdit for clarification: I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to sell it or give it away. If I did sell it I was planning to give my mom and her fianc√© the money for their help getting it for me so I wouldn‚Äôt profit off it. But giving it away seemed easier and more fair to how I got it anyway. Either way, my mom was upset that I was making any decision about it at all. Thanks for all the input.",

      "scenario_description": "Hi reddit (throwaway bc my gf knows my main) need advice because i dont think what i did was so wrong\n\nA few nights ago, I (24f) introduced my girlfriend (25f) to one of my all-time favorite shows, Siberia (spoilers for it below). For those who don‚Äôt know it, it only had one season, ran on NBC, and was a reality show competition kind of like Survivor, but it takes place in Siberia, Russia. Importantly, it‚Äôs not actually a reality show, its a supernatural scifi show that was just shot in the style of a reality show.¬†\n\nThe thing is, I watched the show with my dad as it came out. At the time, I was probably about 13. My dad was the one who was originally interested, and I never saw any of the advertisements by myself. For whatever reason, my dad never let on that this was a supernatural show, so I got to watch it as though it was this crazy, off-the-rails reality show. It was amazing, and it quickly became one of my favorite shows. I actually didn‚Äôt find out until years later that it wasn‚Äôt real, and that made it even cooler for me.¬†\n\nSo, basically when I told my gf that my favorite show was Siberia and that she‚Äôd never heard of it, I had the idea to do the same for her to preserve her viewing experience. I told her that we should totally watch it together but not to look it up because things went really awry and there was a lot of bad press and it will spoil the ‚Äúwinner‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt and we started watching.¬†\n\n\\[SPOILER\\] For some more context, some of the plot of the show includes a contestant dying mysteriously in the first episode, contestants not being able to call for help and then being abandoned by the whole crew, and even an alien-like night-sky-turning-green event in episode four.¬†\n\nMy gf was immediately very concerned and frightened, she couldn‚Äôt believe the show was allowed to air. When asked about certain events, I played it off as it being a different time and so on and she believes me. (in particular, when she asked about the contestant dying, I was just like ‚Äúyeah it was a big deal thats kind of why i told you not to look it up because it wouldve been a massive spoiler‚Äù and that seemed to be okay and again she believed me. I even offered to stop watching at one point but she declined, saying she needed to know what happened (its only like ten episodes).¬†\n\nAfter we finished, I asked for her thoughts. She said she liked it but only in like ‚Äúi can‚Äôt look away‚Äù way, she still couldn‚Äôt believe it ever aired. Thats when I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs because the whole show is fake, its actually a supernatural show made to look like a reality show‚Äù. I expected to see some relief from her but instead she was pissed and started to cry. She said she couldn‚Äôt believe I would do this to her and just left my apartment. I tried texting her over and over how it was just about the viewing experience, that my dad did this to me, and that it really couldn‚Äôt have been that shocking there was literally basically an alien abduction at the end. She hasn‚Äôt responded.\n\nSo basically, AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "AITA - My husband (41) and I (41) both work, we live in Silicon Valley. He makes 3x more than I do but I have to work and contribute as much of my income as possible to household expenses. He pays for most things and I am expected to do all the things involving caring for him, the kids, our home, etc. \n\nMy daughter asked for a party at home this year for her (9) birthday. She wanted a sleepover but all her friends' parents said the girls weren't ready for that. So with my husband's advice I planned an evening sleepover themed party. \n\nAs I was planning I came across really cute tepee style tents with air mattresses that I thought would be perfect. My husband was totally against it. He felt like having a party at home should be done cheap. In previous years we've spent anywhere from $500 to $1000 on parties for the kids. The tepees cost $250, and I bought decor for around an additional $100. He demanded I throw them away immediately following the party because he didn't want them piling up in the garage. In total we spent about $500 on her party. The final straw for him was our daughter asking to go to a Disney Concert after we started planning her party and he knew we were going to do it for her. As a result he flipped out.\n\nI responded with a few things: he was being very mean and negative about every part of our daughter's birthday and towards our kids in general, he has had hundreds of dollars worth of large expensive Lego sets sitting in boxES in our dining room UNOPENED for YEARS, and it was a turn off (because he was demanding \"spicy time\" in exchange for getting things for our daughter's party). \n\nThe result, he hasn't spoken to me in days. He's denying giving me the silent treatment, but he's been quiet, moping, and isolating himself. He didn't even speak to or spend time with our daughter on her birthday. He locked himself in our room and had my son bring him drinks and food all night during her party. Now the party is behind us and I know he deliberately did that to avoid having to pay for anything else in hopes the party and something would fail so he could say \"I told you so \". Or prove without  his money we would have nothing and that's why we should be more appreciative of him. \n\nAITAH, but also is what I said and did genuinely being ungrateful of my husband?  ",

      "scenario_description": "I 27F just got engaged to the love of my life. I have a group of four bridesmaids, all of whom are in late 20s. This story specifically concerns one bridesmaid who I'll call Ellie.\n\nFor bachelorette-type events I am doing two things. One is in my town for dress fittings, spa treatments, followed by a night out, and a brunch the next day. The other is a 2-day Disney trip. I invited all the bridesmaids except Ellie to Disney and said it was because we all know she has limited paid time off and I want to prioritize the day in town because it's more special to have us all be able to really spend time together.\n\nThis was not entirely true. While she has limited PTO, that wasn't the reason why she wasn't invited. Honestly, she's a big girl. I'd estimate upwards of 250lbs. This doesn't matter, she's gorgeous and I love her, but it does affect her ability to participate in anything with even moderate physical activity. For example, last year, we had walked about 1/2 a mile to a restaurant in 75 degree weather and she was out of breath within about 2 minutes and needed to recover in the AC for a solid 10 minutes after we got to the restaurant before Ellie was really able to engage in the conversation. Another time, we went on a \"hike\" in the park which was a flat 1/3 mile loop and I had to pretend that I needed a break because it was obvious she was struggling and I didn't want her to feel embarrassed for needing a break. I'm also somewhat worried that she wouldn't be able to fit in some of the rides.\n\nI really, really don't want to be mean and exclude her but I also know what's going to happen if she comes. She's going to be exhausted and need to sit down or find AC. We're going to feel bad and hang out with her so she doesn't get left behind. Ellie would of course never ask us to wait for her or anything but that's what friends do.\n\nA few days ago, Ellie called me and said she was hurt to not be invited and that she would take unpaid time off to join. I tried to say we had already booked the hotel, she said she would find accommodations. When she asked for a third time, I finally told her that we're going to be doing a lot of walking and I wasn't sure if she could keep up. I don't want her to feel embarrassed or unwelcome, but her weight makes it hard for her to enjoy herself and it brings the mood down. I didn't specifically say anything about weight but she immediately took it as me calling her fat. I mean, I kind of was. I support her existing in any shape or size, but some shapes and sizes make activities a lot harder.\n\nAITA for telling a friend she couldn't keep up on a Disney trip?",

      "scenario_description": "I am a mother of two; Vanessa (25) and Brandon (22). I am not married to their father, but they both have a relationship with him. They went to visit him this past weekend for Father‚Äôs day and were set to get to my house on Monday.¬†\n\nBrandon drove the two of them there and was supposed to drive back. The car he drives was mine originally. I paid it off and did not ask him to buy it from me on the condition that he is responsible with it; he was only paying for gas and maintenance. This was the first car I have ever been able to pay for upfront without taking out a loan, which carries sentimental value, so it is my car as far as I‚Äôm concerned.\n\n¬†A few minutes after they left their dad‚Äôs, I got a call from Vanessa saying that they had gotten into an accident. I asked if the car was damaged, and she told me it was totaled. I was immediately furious because Brandon knew how hard I worked for that car and I was very clear that I expected him to care for it. I asked Vanessa to please put her brother on the phone. Instead, their father came on and explained that they were in the emergency room and that our son was receiving treatment.\n\nMy ex then started to berate me for being more concerned about the property than about the kids and for getting angry at our son without knowing the situation, but in my defense, I hadn‚Äôt realized that he was injured. To be clear, Brandon will be fine and the other driver was completely unharmed, but they are all still furious with me. I had assumed that if his injuries were serious that it would have been the first thing they told me, but that isn‚Äôt a good enough explanation for them. Its been a few days now and both kids are still with their father and won't come stay with me. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: First of all, to be very clear, I do not care about the car more than I care about my children. It was a moment of heightened emotion and I spoke before thinking. I can concede that it was insensitive. To be clear again, my son has a concussion and a few broken ribs but will be fine. The car is unsalvageable, and yes, it is insured, but that will not replace the sentimental value, but it's fine. Now, I called my children to apologize and explain that I would not have asked about the car first had I known that they were in an ER. Vanessa admitted that she should have told me that first but that she was very stressed at the time. I was not able to get far into the conversation when their father came in with some choice words for me, and the call ended shortly after. I believe he may be manipulating the kids into not wanting to talk to me or come over, but they are adults and that is their prerogative. My plan is to let it play out. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (28M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for 2 years. We live in a big city and our relationship is serious‚Äîwe‚Äôre planning a future together.\n\nMy mom (58F) lives in another state but was visiting. We‚Äôve always had a complicated dynamic. She can be loving but very controlling, and we clash over respect and boundaries.\n\nA while ago, I made the mistake of venting to my parents about a fight with my girlfriend. It wasn‚Äôt anything extreme‚Äîjust normal relationship tension about communication. I said my girlfriend can overthink or get reactive when feeling insecure. I realize now I shouldn‚Äôt have shared that.\n\nMy dad heard it and has been supportive and respectful since. My mom, however, latched onto it as proof my girlfriend is bad for me.\n\nDuring this visit, she refused to use my girlfriend‚Äôs name and made passive-aggressive remarks. She also complained that my girlfriend took a small mirror and told me to ‚Äútell your girlfriend to put it back,‚Äù which really pissed me off. I found it petty and disrespectful.\n\nWe had a tense breakfast conversation where she wouldn‚Äôt drop the topic. I didn‚Äôt yell but firmly told her to stop. I said I‚Äôd leave if she kept it up and eventually told her I‚Äôd pay and she could go. She was so offended she moved to a hotel and sent me an emotional message saying she‚Äôs done with me and mocking the idea I‚Äôd try to set ‚Äúterms‚Äù for dinner.\n\nHer message said I ‚Äúalways‚Äù disrespect her, that I put my girlfriend over her, and that she‚Äôs tired of it. She accused me of being ungrateful and treating her badly all my life.\n\nFor context, my mom has also routinely overshared her marital problems with me (like details about fights with my dad I didn‚Äôt want to hear). I‚Äôve listened without judging, and I mentioned this in my message.\n\nI texted her saying:\n\n-I won‚Äôt tolerate her insulting or refusing to name my girlfriend.\n\n-I know I shouldn‚Äôt have involved them in our couple‚Äôs issues.\n\n-I won‚Äôt let anyone tell me who I can or can‚Äôt be with.\n-I love her, but this is non-negotiable.\n\n-I want us to keep couple conflicts private so we can have a healthy relationship.\n\n-I‚Äôm here if she wants to talk or have dinner, but without that topic.\n\nShe replied with ‚ÄúITS OVER!!‚Äù and says she‚Äôs done with me.\n\nI genuinely love my mom, but I also love my girlfriend. I‚Äôm not choosing one over the other‚ÄîI just want respect. I don‚Äôt expect my mom to love my girlfriend, but I do expect her to be polite and not drag me into insulting her.\n\nAITA for standing my ground and telling my mom she can‚Äôt insult my girlfriend or try to control who I see?",

She (34F) knows this. She recently got pregnant, and as you know pregnant women should limit their intereaction with litter. We get along fairly well I would say. She and her bf (lives 40mins away) lightheartedly said that \"It's your (my) responsibility to clean the kitty litter now\". We live a block away from each other and I am excited about the baby and want to help and provide support as best as I can, just not with that. I feel like a shitty sister, but I also don't want to do it. AITA?\n\nUpdate -\nWow! I did not expect this many responses. Thank you everyone. To answer similar questions in the thread:\n1. This is a fairly new relationship (between sis and her bf). Despite that they did plan to get pregnant. I don't ask many questions regarding that - to each their own. \n2. I do not know their plans to cohabitate, for now, as far as I know, they will continue to live 40 mins apart. Though this question isn't about them.\n3. My sister moved a block away from me a year ago to be closer to me, and likes the area, which I've lived in for 5 years.\n4. The BF is not a terrible guy, he is very much involved and an intentional participant in this whole process, which makes their comment of me taking care of the kitty litter even more confusing.

      "scenario_description": "I F18 have enlisted in the navy as of my 18th birthday of my senior year. I had been talking about wanting to be a pilot since i was a sophmore in highschool but after getting a bit older i started leaning away from it my mom was all onboard for it and really wanted to me to do it she would constantly talk to me about all specific kinds of pilot or aviation related jobs in the navy when i started the enlisting process. After a while i didint like the idea of it and my backup had always been medical and slowly i started leaning more and more towards it. My mom constantly posts every single part of my life on her social media including every step and failure i had during my enlistment process (having to get waivers for things i didint want public). When i decided to go medical i made the choice not to tell her and only tell some friends so that i could get some opinions with out telling her i decided that it was what i wanted to do. Today i went in and signed the final papers and picked my job with out telling her what it was when i got home she asked and i came clean and got met with anger and screaming. Her best friend from highschool who is now my bestfriends mom is a nurse and her dad is a emt so i had asked them opinions too once i had already decided just to get some feild perspective on the matter and they where on board i told my mom this and i got screamed at because she thinks they where influencing me to chose something like them. Which i think is funny because my moms degree is in biology so i just wanna know Am i the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "\nI (M26) am living with my long term best friend (A, M25), and our mutual friend/their partner (B, F25), and promised a couple years ago that I wouldn't move out if they couldn't find someone to replace me. Now I want to move out, and our tenancy is up for renewal, but they haven't made any effort in the past 4-5 months to find someone except for one of our friends (C, M26), who I'm worried won't be accepted by the landlord. They waited months to fill in the necessary forms, and even if they hadn't just lost their job, they probably didn't earn enough to be approved. There is another person (D, M19) in our close-knit group who would want to move in, but my housemates don't want that because of his age.\n\nLiving here is so bad for my mental health, my friends barely help with the cleaning, smoke weed and cigarettes in the house, and will spill the ash trays and not even clean them up properly, they leave takeaway boxes out for days, leave food in the sink, wet clothes in the washing machine, and they constantly play loud music/movies until 1-3AM in our small retirement community-esque neighbourhood. I tried so so hard for the first couple years to just keep the place clean but it's honestly impossible with how messy they are, especially with my health issues. I felt really pressured and expected to do this just because I wasn't working, but now that neither of them are working either I'm realising that they just don't clean, and don't care about the mess. If I want to live in a clean home I have to do it all myself, but that just isn't fair or sustainable. I've talked to them about this multiple times and nothing changes. They also just can't take care or adult responsibilities, like essential phone calls (I've had to make their Universal Credit phone calls and submit evidence for them), responding to emails from the landlord, cleaning for house inspections, etc. etc., so I'm just taking on so much responsibility.\n\nI just want to move out of here, and in with my partner, but I feel so trapped because I can't just make my friends homeless by not renewing the tenancy. They don't seem to see any issue with any of this, and don't have any sense of urgency even with our tenancy agreement ending in 6 weeks, and basically just have the attitude of \"well I guess you can't move out then\". Am I the asshole for being angry and hurt over this? Would I be the asshole if I just didn't sign the tenancy agreement, despite my promise?",

I had Taylor with my College GF, we broke up when Taylor was just a baby (under a year old). We coparented well together. Now that Taylor is older, she comes here when she wants but primarily stays with her mom since she's closer to her school/ friends. I got married to my now wife 8 years ago, we now have 2 daughters together. Taylor‚Äôs always gotten along great with my wife and her little sisters. \n\nMe, my wife and all 3 girls went to Disney world for a few days. Taylor has always been a huge Belle fan. First day at Disney I had some work to do so I got up early and got ready and went to the lobby while the girls got ready. When I went back up to the room my youngest 2 were dressed in princess dresses and crowns. While my oldest had on a very what I would call belle themed outfit. When I saw the younger 2 I said you two look just like princesses. My youngest asked what about Taylor, Taylor in the last few years has been over the cute pet names. So I said I think Taylor is a little too old to be a princess but she's very pretty. Taylor said thanks but sounded a little off. I didnt think anything of it. \n\nWe had a good day, Taylor was distant with me but having fun with my wife and her sisters. I figured I would ask her when we got back to the hotel. Well I got a long angry text from my ex wife, saying Taylor had texted her that I called her sisters princesses but not her and said she was too old to be a princess and that really hurt her feelings I guess. I reminded my ex that Taylor has hated cute pet names for years now. My ex said considering we‚Äôre at Disney and Taylor was in a Belle themed outfit I should have thought that she might have wanted to be a princess for the day. My ex said I was being a oblivious AH, I tried talking to Taylor but she doesn't want to talk about it and hasnt talked to me much. My wife thinks I could have handled the situation better and made it up to Taylor. I don't think assuming my teen daughter wouldn't want to be called a princess is being an AH. ",

      "scenario_description": "Hey there! This is my first post on this reddit.......topic. Going to say that this happened last Tuesday and I'm still pretty upset about it. This isn't that long so I'll make this as long as I possibly can.\n\nFor private reasons we're going to name my sister Susie. My mom told me that she was going to a business conference in DC, so I was going to stay at my grandma's house for the week. Reminder, I have no car or a license. Something happened and I don't know what, but I was given one extra day from the day I was supposed to be there, I was meant to be dropped off on Monday but went there on Tuesday instead. My sister offered to take me to my grandma's house herself (according to my mom). Now to the story part.\n\nThe day comes around and I'm getting ready to leave with her, get my suitcase downstairs, my blowup mattress, the sheets and comforters for the mattress, my hygiene stuff, the stuff I bring for entertainment, the food I got, etc. My sister was putting so much pressure on me to get me ready as fast as possible, because she had to go home for work (not where me and my mom live). Keep telling me she was going to leave with or without me, told me to hurry up despite her apartment is a couple hours away from here, and kept telling me that she was going to leave in 35 minutes, 10 minutes, 7 minutes, like no time whatsoever. We forgot this Army monument thing that we were supposed to take to my grandma's house to pay tribute to my grandfather who died 2 years back, but I nearly forgot the food, I had to rush to get everything in there. Thankfully that was my last trip in there, but when I walked out of the house my sister's car was gone. I got so upset I immediately started to call her, but then I looked around a bit and just saw she parked in the parking lot across the street (my house is on a hill). I know you have to go back home but, come on Susie! That was not a cool thing to do. Then when we started to go to my grandma's house, she told me \"It's very rude to take that long\". Oh, I forgot to mention that most of my stuff was already in her car.\n\nFast forward to Sunday and my mom was picking me up from my grandmother's house. I told her everything on what happened with my sister. She was not that thrilled about it and told me that she was just going to take me there next time. I also found out about my sister offering to take me from my mom. I was really pissed on how she handled this, but I also feel a bit bad about the situation. If I'm the one to blame for this, please let me know. So, AITA for wasting my sister's time?",

      "scenario_description": "I (24 M) am a camp counselor and this is my 5th year as one at this specific camp I'm at. Keeping everything anonymous/on this burner for privacy of everyone. \n\nEarlier last week, some kids were trying to guess my age while we were making crafts. When they guessed it, a young camper asked me \"why are you 24 but so big?\". I'm only about 5'4 so I was a bit confused. I asked them what they meant and this kid replied with \"why are you fat?\". Now I am a bit heavy, but this still shocked me because I was not expecting to be called fat while at work. \n\nThe kid had no ill intentions. Kids come to odd conclusions all the time so I just pulled them to the side and gently explained that commenting on someone's body isn't nice. I didn't yell or make a big deal out of it. I just quickly told the kid that it wasn't nice and moved on because it really isn't a big deal. This was a one and done situation. \n\nAs me and the other counselors were cleaning up at the end of the day, I recalled what happened with a laugh because honestly, it was kind of funny. I expected them to laugh but instead one got serious and told me I needed to report this to our boss. I said no because this was an elementary age kid who didn't even mean to be rude. I explained to them what I told the kid but they insisted that I report this because it is a \"serious issue\". Again, this was a one and done situation. Even to this day, I haven't had any more issues from that camper. My coworker started saying that I was being unprofessional and that things like this needed to be reported. They think I'm being an asshole for \"pushing this under the rug\". I still refused and after a week, they still pester me about how I'm not cooperating. I just don't feel like this is worth making a big deal out of it. It's gotten to the point where I even reread the handbook to see if I needed to report this (spoiler alert, I don't). And on top of that, I don't want to bother my boss with this little incident because I don't think it's that big of a deal. \n\nI don't know. Am I being an asshole for not reporting this camper to my boss?\n\n",

We've only been dating for 3 months and I seriously do like, care and genuinely love her.\n\nFor further context, lately I've been overwhelmed with work and I keep telling her this job is taking out of my mental health. I need some personal space to calm myself down. And all I do to calm myself is just staying home and play games. When I do, I sometimes don't look at my phone and won't reply to anyone, including her.\n\nSure communication might be the problem coming from me, I should just tell her I wanna play games and won't touch my phone. But I've already told her over and over she can just check my discord/steam if I'm playing or not. I literally only have 1 day off from a 45hour work/week.\n\nI also understand where she's coming from. Before we met she got cheated on her previous relationship. She said that was her first time dealing that kind of heartbreak. I've been there too. But I don't like it when she brings her trauma to this relationship. We talked about this and she asked \"so I was the problem?\". We got into a heated argument and in the end I gave in and moving on.\n\nAITA? Or I'm too indulging on my own rights as a partner?",

While here, they stay with me an my husband (M31) and our 3 young kids. We love having them stay. \n\nToday however I got a call from my mum saying their friend ‚ÄòGeorge‚Äô (in his mid 20s I think) who is from their church (who they have known for a few years now says he thinks of them as second parents now) wants to visit Canada and stay at our house along with my parents for Christmas. My mum said they‚Äôd spoken about him visiting Canada in the past but she imagined this would happen when they had moved back here and had their own place - so always said she liked the idea. \n\nGeorge went to dinner at my parents house yesterday and brought up coming to Canada this Christmas, to stay with them at our house  and my mum didn‚Äôt have the heart to say no. She asked if this would be okay with us?\n\nMy husband and I have never met George and am due to have my 4 baby in a few months and it‚Äôs our year to host Christmas for our extended family - so Christmas is already going to be a bit hectic. \n\nI just don‚Äôt love the idea of someone I don‚Äôt know staying in our house and being around our family and tagging along and joining all our family traditions. Nothing specifically against George - I‚Äôm sure he is nice enough if my parents think so.\n\nSpace wise - we do have have a study that my husband uses to work from home. However my husband will still need to work some days before / after Christmas and I don‚Äôt know what kind of dates George is thinking of staying. \n\nI told my mum while I don‚Äôt really want George to stay here but if he gets his own accomodation - he can come for lunch at Christmas with the rest of the extended family. My mum was nice about it but I could tell she was a bit disappointed / sad and mentioned the trip would become a lot more expensive for him so he might not be able to do it. I can tell she felt awkward to have to tell him he can‚Äôt stay here.\n\nFor context my parents have always been people to open their home when others need it so I feel a bit bad saying no and now making my mum have to pass the message along. \n\nI think most people in my position would have said no but I do feel a bit bad so just wanting to know AITA here? Should I have thought about it more before giving an answer - I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd change my mind though.",

      "scenario_description": "I (33F) am married to the love of my life (37M), but his mother is driving me insane. Recently, we started a remodel on our house and she decided that she would help us by managing the whole thing for $20/hr because she has some experience doing that.\n\nShe and the contractors she hired show up with little or no warning constantly, just letting themselves into my house. She lets herself into our backyard and gives our dogs raw meat to keep them occupied while she looks at things. Not only is that bad for them, but they often eat it on our bed and furniture, which is disgusting. Twice I have had to run away from her in my own home to keep her from seeing me naked.\n\nI think from her perspective, she is saving me from having to deal with the contractors and letting me relax while they do their work. She doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that as an introvert who hates having my space and privacy invaded, it would be much better for me to feel prepared when they come. Also, not interacting with the contractors just makes things very awkward.\n\nRecently, my mother-in-law said she felt like she was doing too much and asked me to take over managing the project. I was thrilled. But then, she continued managing the project anyway.\n\nShe gave me a call one night that I missed and the next morning, one of the contractors showed up to the house knocking at the front door when neither me or my husband were ready and I wasn‚Äôt feeling well. We didn‚Äôt answer. He then proceeded around the back of our house and tried to let himself into our back door. My dogs went crazy and he was freaked out and upset (my dogs are friendly, but they are big and the contractors are scared of them). It turns out my mother-in-law went ahead and scheduled him to come even though she hadn‚Äôt reached me and wasn‚Äôt supposed to be managing the project anymore. She told him to just go ahead and go inside.\n\nI convinced my husband to tell her that I really want to manage the project like we had agreed. Now, she is just being passive aggressive and sending me texts telling me who to call and when and exactly what to say to them.\n\nSo now, I feel extremely anxious in my own home, the dogs are constantly freaking out, that one contractor clearly hates me, my mother-in-law is being passive aggressive, and my husband and I are fighting because he just wants me to grin and bear it until it‚Äôs over. I‚Äôm on the verge of a complete mental breakdown. I want my husband to set clear boundaries with his mom because, to me, it is completely insane to let yourself into your adult son‚Äôs home without permission. He doesn‚Äôt seem to think it‚Äôs a problem and he doesn‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings by talking to her. I think it would be better coming from him than me.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: My mother-in-law is severely overbearing and is invading my privacy during a remodel. My husband doesn‚Äôt want to talk to her.",

      "scenario_description": "I (21m) was hanging out with my closest friend group (5 guys total) I‚Äôve had since high school when something odd happened. Suddenly, after years of using the word himself (and all of us regularly using it), one friend (D) was taken aback by another friend (N) saying the word ‚Äúretarded.‚Äù\n\nHe made a big deal of it being a ‚Äúslur‚Äù and shamed N for using it liberally. When N questioned this shift, D replied, ‚ÄúWhy use a slur? It‚Äôs just not cool to say anymore.‚Äù\n\nFor context, we‚Äôve been super close since freshman year of high school. Now, the summer before senior year of college, we‚Äôre still close but less so due to naturally attending different schools. We used to hang out every weekend‚Äîsmoking weed, drinking beers, playing Super Smash Bros, DnD, etc. We‚Äôre not big ‚Äútrash-talkers‚Äù either; growing up in a nice area with solid education instilled values of kindness and respect. We‚Äôre mostly just goofy nerds.\n\nThere‚Äôs an unspoken understanding that we‚Äôre generally left-wing. Growing up in progressive areas instilled these ideals. I‚Äôve personally shifted slightly toward the center after finding my place in the world, but I remain a big proponent of basic human rights and equality. Same goes for everyone else in the group. When we made ‚Äúedgy‚Äù jokes, it was always understood as satire‚Äîfunny because it‚Äôs opposite of our real beliefs. For example, making Hitler jokes since 4 out of 5 of us are Jewish.\n\nNow, six years later, there‚Äôs a sudden shift in group vibe‚Äînot because N and I desperately need to say ‚Äúoh that was retarded‚Äù during Smash, but because there‚Äôs now tension and authority in the group. D and another guy (R) are suddenly very anti-slur, while N and I (still quite left-wing in our beliefs) see no issue as long as these words aren‚Äôt used derogatorily. That just wouldn‚Äôt be cool. The last guy (J) seems neutral‚Äîprobably doesn‚Äôt care about ‚Äúslurs‚Äù and just wants to have fun.\n\nNo one even used ‚Äúretard‚Äù specifically to be funny. Maybe in funny situations, sure, but it‚Äôs more synonymous with ‚Äústupid‚Äù than purely for shock value. The sudden contempt for this usage seems to give D and R an air of superiority, as if censoring these words makes them more mature. If it slips now, the vibe immediately feels off (though we avoid comments or lectures if lucky).\n\nAm I the asshole, or does D‚Äôs sudden judgment of ‚Äúretard‚Äù stem more from conformist indulgence in censorship among modern leftists rather than a genuine push for good?\n\nI understand removing it from medical dictionaries since it‚Äôs antiquated. I‚Äôd never use it for someone with disabilities. But bringing woke rules into a chill night with the boys? Seems retarded.",

      "scenario_description": "My wife and I just welcomed our first child back in August. She‚Äôs a beautiful baby girl, she‚Äôs about to be 10 months. It‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs first grandbaby so she‚Äôs super excited and she‚Äôs my grandmothers second great grandchild.\n\nWhen I first found out my wife was pregnant I told my grandmother. My grandma proceeded to tell me how it‚Äôs been so long since she‚Äôs cared for a baby and she‚Äôs not entirely sure of what to do. My grandma also mentioned how she can‚Äôt lift a baby anymore or hold one for an extended period of time. On top of that my grandmother ended up falling a few months after that conversation and she couldn‚Äôt get up. I had to race to her home to help her off her kitchen floor. \n\nNow that my daughter is here my grandma has been bugging me about babysitting. She only gets to see my daughter once or twice a month and obviously my daughter is still very young so she doesn‚Äôt always recognize my grandma and I think that bothers her. \n\nDue to everything I mentioned above, I have refused to allow my grandmother to babysit my daughter on her own. She claims she will be fine for up to four hours. Her plan is to put a blanket on the floor and let my daughter play on the blanket until I return.\n\nWell I know my daughter and common sense says a 10 month old isn‚Äôt going to quietly sit on a blanket for four hours. I‚Äôm also terrified of what if my grandmother who is 75 years old and 300 pounds falls on my baby. It would be over for my girl. I feel bad but I‚Äôm not comfortable leaving my baby unsupervised with my grandmother. AITA for feeling this way and shielding my baby from her? I have no problem taking my baby over her house but I‚Äôm not leaving them alone for an extended period of time. ",

As soon I saw him I put out the fire and went to figure out what was going on. When I went inside I found him bleeding from a deep head laceration. Immediately I ran out side and called my parents who where 20 min away. I then examined the wound and realized it was deeper than my grandmother said it was. Then my parents called and after she started yelling at me because I should not have called them. I ran outside and called my other grandmother (who is a retired nurse). In the end my parents took him the ER and he got staples. Am I wrong for what I did?",

Today she had $10 on her and asked to use that money for it. I told her sure and she ran over to play. I was getting a cart and she came back over crying and said it took her money without letting her play. She asked if we could go to the customer service counter to get her money back but I said no. I thought it would be a valuable teaching lesson not to fall for scams. I figured the game would be a scam anyways so I saw no point in trying to get a refund. I told her no and said that this is a lesson not to throw away money like that in the future. I took her home after shopping and now my wife is livid with me for not doing it and actually took her to the store to get the money back. I just thought this would be a lesson I don't see why she needs it back since now she won't learn from it. AITA?",

She had criticized a few small things earlier in the evening, which I thought was a little odd, but Ok. Later in the evening, she started in on me. She wanted to know why there are still cardboard boxes in the basement since we had moved last summer (9 months ago at that point). She said it was a mess and r here‚Äôs stuff everywhere. I stopped listening so honestly I couldn‚Äôt tell you. I stopped her and pointed at my partner. I said ‚Äúhe will tell you, with all honesty right now that he hasn‚Äôt washed a dish, scooped the cat box, cleaned a toilet or done anything close to it since I moved in‚Äù and he agreed with me. And her response was ‚Äúwell our dad never did any of that‚Äù‚Ä¶. Like it was a perfectly reasonable explanation. To digress: in a later conversation, his response was also that in his house growing up, the ‚Äúbreadwinner‚Äù didn‚Äôt clean. I hate that phrase now. I explained that I also work full time (I make less than he does), I am fully responsible for the kids (they are mine biologically, his step kids for all I‚Äôs and P‚Äôs), I do the cooking, all shopping and running errands. And my amount of time spent at home is the same as his, if not LESS. He agreed, he is not the ONLY ‚Äúbreadwinner‚Äù. \nHe also does not usually mention when the house is out of order and still doesn‚Äôt lift a finger. \nBack to his sister‚Ä¶. This was almost 3 months ago. He went no contact with sister for confronting me about the house being messy (again, 3 kids under the age of 7 and both of us work full time; only I clean when time is available‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm doing my best here people)‚Ä¶. Well, the other day his sister called him and apparently they had a happy old chat. Apparently **** eye roll **** he told her why I‚Äôm upset (she already knew) and he asked if she would reach out to me and talk about it. She asked if maybe she should apologize and he said that might help. His stance is; that‚Äôs the end of it. It‚Äôs up to her, and no matter what, it‚Äôs his family and I need to let it go. My stance is, she stood on my own front porch and insulted me. When she could have said maybe that she sees it‚Äôs a struggle when I have a lot going on; and maybe I could use a hand. Or simply keep her mouth shut and appreciate an invitation to spend time with family. I don‚Äôt automatically forgive her. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ok to brush under the rug because she‚Äôs his family. She was hateful and judgmental when I invited her into our home. Am I really the AH here??",

We already had the design and all the details finalized months ahead, but 3 months before the wedding she casually showed me a picture of a wedding cake and told me that one of  her friend would be doing that cake for them instead. Not only did she completely change the cake design, but she also added other desserts on top of that. She didn‚Äôt even give an explanation or apologize as to why she suddenly has someone else do their cake. Ngl, i was extremely hurt as that was supposed to be my wedding gift for them and everyone in my family were already expecting me to make that cake. My brother‚Äôs fianc√© told me i can help out with something else or that if i want, i can pay for something else instead as a wedding gift. I told her i‚Äôll help them out as much as i could but i won‚Äôt commit to something that‚Äôs out of my budget. \n\nA month before the wedding, her friend that was supposed to make their cake messaged me and asked me(and all my baker friends) if she can borrow my baking supplies as she‚Äôs from a different place and doesn‚Äôt really have anything to use for her baking. She said she doesn‚Äôt want to buy just for that one event. I‚Äôm not selfish by any means but i just can‚Äôt comprehend as to why i have to go through all the trouble packing all my stuff and asking my friends if i can borrow their stuff as well. It‚Äôs just a bit of a slap in the face knowing that she asked someone to make their cake and then have them use my stuff.  AITA if i say no to sharing my stuff or should i be the bigger person and just let it all go??\n\n",

It was only like a 15 min drive home and i told her Bonnie would be up front and offered to just get her an Uber if she didnt want to deal with it. this has happened a few times before like its not the first time. She said it was fine and specifically said \"ok no worries\" (i have the receipts lol). i even have to do a breathalyzer thing to start the car and she was more annoyed with bonnie than that lol.\n\ni got there to get her and she got to the car and opened to front and seemed surprised to see bonnie, and was like \"are you serious\" and i said yeah we talked about it. she got in the back but was clearly annoyed. when we got home she was cold and finally said she was embarassed a dog would be before her in riding in the car. she also said that bonnie could have ridden in her lap?? like that wasnt a discussion before and honestly i dont think that wouldve worked at all, bonnie is kinda a nut lol.\n\nwhen i got back and told my friends and family they all were basically telling me how much of an asshole i was. that i should have made bonnie go in the back, or honestly not have brought her at all. i think some of my friends are a little jealous of our relationship, GF is very attractive def like more attractive then i am if that makes sense.   \n  \nthe family telling me i should have acted differently is what really makes me feel like they dont get it but im wondering if i should have done it differently. definitely know i did something wrong here lol but not sure what. i always carry the luggage too even if we dont like the music we chose for the ride home.",

      "scenario_description": "So, I (Under-18 ftm) have been pushed to start Lazer hair removal for my legs by my entire family for 2 years now, but mostly my dad (50m).  I eventually gave in after a year of CONSTANTLY fighting. I have been going to appointments for a year now. \nI got PCOS so I naturally have a LOT of body hair, something I actually really like about myself since it makes me feel more masculine. I couldn't explain it to my dad at the time so I had run out of excuses.\n\nAfter the first appointment, he kept talking to everyone about it. Family, friends, EVERYONE knew. This made me visibly uncomfortable but he never stopped.\n\nA few months ago, at around April, I made it VERY clear I wasn't going to go there again and he got MAD. We fought a lot and I came out after I cut my hair in the bathroom sink. Despite my parents not being completely against me being trans, they keep telling me \"not to rush it\" and keep referring to me as a woman.\n\nAfter I came out, while we were in the car, he managed to convince me into going to do what he said was going to be \"the last time\". This was because I was really emotional because my parents hadn't actually started with their \"don't rush it\" bulshit and, because I was actually hoping for something to change, I did everything they wanted me to. \n\nApparently, for him, \"the last time\" included the repeat visit and it was not the last time in general but the last time until summer ended. I was never made aware of this context.\n\nWhen I found out today, I was FUMING. He kept telling me to stay quiet about it in the Lazer place and, after we went out into the streets, he kept acting like nothing was wrong, completely refusing to talk about the matter.\n\nAfter I realised I was NOT going to get an explanation, I started being really cold to him; I answered every question very drily and sarcastically and kept acting distant, pointedly avoiding physical contact and looking everywhere else but at him. \n\nWhen we got into the car, he drove to the supermarket and, when I told him I was going to stay in the car (and not shop with him), he got angry. He asked me if I wasn't going to help him and I said no. That was when he told me that I only care about myself but left me alone in the car and went inside the store.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I changed the phrasing so this makes more sense \n",

      "scenario_description": "Mistyped my title: AITA for making my daughter redo her book reports for the summer because she used audiobooks instead of reading them\n\nSorry on phone\n\nReading comprehension and listening comprehension are two different things\n\nMy daughter is in middle school, and over the summer, the kids are given a list to choose some books to read and answer questions. These \"book reports\" (it's more of a package and essay with questions about the book) are due the first day back at school. It's just a summer reading assignment they have to complete. Sara has to read two books from the ten-book list and fill out the corresponding book report.\n\nI was impressed that she had already filled out one of the packages, and she claimed she was in the middle of the other book.  Reading has never been her strongest subject. Yesterday I learned she was not reading the book; instead, she found the audiobooks online and was listening to them. That defeats the purpose of practicing reading skills; reading and listening are completely different things.\n\nI informed her that she needs to pick out two different books from the list, and she will need to read them. I will be monitoring her phone more closely and she will join me for 30 mins every day to just read. I will also be reading during that time. She was not happy about this.\n\nToday was our first reading session. Sara was very unhappy and my husband and I got into an argument after. He thinks I am being a jerk, and she was able to fill out the packages so what is the problem? I told him that being able to fill out the package isn't the point; the point is to practice reading comprehension. Not listening. Especially since reading is a subject she has trouble with.  I love audiobooks (I usually listen to one going to work), but they are not reading, it's a different skill.\n\nHe thinks I am being unfair and a jerk, we are at a standstill on this and want more opinions. Am i being a jerk about this.\n\nEdit: She doesn't have dyslexia,  she was tested, the teacher recommended that to everyone who was in the lower reading group, and we listened to her. She just struggles with this subject. Some kids struggle in math or history. She struggles in reading",

      "scenario_description": "I 43f am married to my husband 44m and we have two great kids 15m and 10f. \n\nOur daughter has been wanting to watch more mature things for a while and she has really been wanting to watch stranger things, but we feel she is too young for that show. \n\nRecently she eavesdropped on me and my husband and heard me say the passcode to my Netflix account out loud, she then logged into my Netflix account and attempted to watch Stranger things. \n\nShe tried to do this very late at night while she thought we'd be asleep but I was on my way to the bathroom and passed by her room and heard that she was watching Stranger things, so I went in and made her turn it off and give me the remote. I also told her that we would have to change the passcode now ( which I know now was a mistake). \n\nEvery time I talked to my husband about changing the passcode I worried she could easily find it out again and be able to use my account. And my husband and I both work so we can't be home to stop her all the time. \n\nSo I asked our son 15m who sometimes watches her when we're not home, to make sure she didn't watch anything she wasn't allowed to watch and to tell us if she got access to my account. \n\nHe agreed but insisted I pay him 20 bucks every time he tattled on his sister and I reluctantly agreed. \n\nThis went on for a few days, she would find out the new passcode for my account and he would find out about it and tell us then we had to change it again. Our son managed to get his sister to tell him about her eavesdropping on us and that that was how she figured out the passcode for my account. \n\nWe finally just wrote the new passcode down and didn't say the words out loud to make sure she wouldn't be able to hear it and we made it very random and wordy so she couldn't guess it either. \n\nLuckily this worked out and she can no longer access my account and can't watch anything inappropriate. \n\nBut last night my son came in to collect the last 20 bucks i owed him and my husband asked what was that about, I told him about the deal I made with our son and this made him very upset. \n\nHe said it was wrong to bribe our son to help us parent our daughter and it could damage their relationship if she ever found out. I told him we just needed some help and he was happy to help us out here, but my husband insisted it was inappropriate to pay our son to rat out his sister  and it crossed a line. \n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I live in a condo with one parking garage and one outdoor parking spot. They are both included in the condo under the stipulation I pay for the parking spot a sum of money with the association dues every month until I decide to sell. My roommate who lives with me does not have a car, Recently decided to lend my spot to the neighbor when I'm not using it/stepped aside because \"they asked nicely\" I expressed disappointment and kindly asked them please don't do this anymore I don't think it's fair for me to pay $$ every month to share my spot with someone else. Especially when there's a 2 parking per unit limit some ppl somehow own like 4 cars.\n\nMy roommate said I was selfish for hoarding the spot cuz it wasn't in use at that moment . I explained that if the neighbors want a spot to park in they could use their own or park on street but it didn't seem fair for me to be forced share when I've stepped away. \n\nAITA here? Or just crazy ü§£üòß\n\nEdit for clarification. Sorry English is not my first language \nMy roommate uses they/them pronouns and identify as non binary\n\nThere was no consent from my end when this spot was lended out. No money received \n\nNobody is paying me for parking im  paying for my own parking and allowed my roommate the space in the garage to store their things in lieu of a car\n\n\nUpdate ; thank you everyone for their input I've spoken with my roommate and they've agreed not to lend my spot out when I'm not using it, I used the Xbox example someone mentioned earlier as a reason why this crosses my boundaries. I mentioned maybe renting it out but they didn't want to be bothered by work and I don't want to set a schedule of when I won't be home/ back home for the spot. Just seems silly I should be able to return home whenever I need to ",

She won't go to a doctor.We have had multiple fights about that . So I found her some easy exercises to do from net.  But she also won't do that. She is repeating that I do all that housework and that is my exercise. \n\nNow recently I found that my relative who is also close to mom's age is knee cap replacement surgery due to the bone being eroded and no synovial fluid present.She hid the pain from her family for 6 months.\nSo I told my mother about her and she told me just because she had it , it would not make sense that i would also have it. I told her that's preposterous. Now we had another loud fight. \n\nShe pulled my father into this. My father has recently passed away due to major strike and heart attack. She told that when a person time comes , they go. I believe that's shit. I told her if my father had not drunk and smoked regularly then he wouldnt have such major problems in all major organs kidney,lungs,liver and heart.He also suffered from high bp and high cholesterol. I told her if she hadn't coddled him so much making him every thing he wants and letting him have those cigarettes. She should have fought like me. I literally got beaten multiple times by my father even until college because I asked him to stop taking cigarette and drinks. Still,By the time i left for college. I had reduced his drinking problem to weekly and sometimes monthly. For that , I got beaten half to death.\n\nWhile the verbal fight was ongoing with her,then as an example, she pulled my uncle who was a fit person until suffering from a major cerebral stroke and he passed away.  She told me \"He never drinked or smoked. Still, God took him away because it was his time\". I told her that it was an accidental stroke and she should not take an example from another person since she is rejecting my example of the relative. That's hypocrisy. \n\nNow she told me you fight so much and raise your voice so much that will cause much high  Blood Pressure which will affect my body more than exercise. I told her so what if I shout , what if my bp is high . God is supposed to take me own time right . I spread out my hands and exaggerated \" SO TAKE ME NOW\". And now she broke down crying.

      "scenario_description": "We have a toddler, a two year old girl.\n\nRecently her hair has gotten so long that it's getting tangled at night. I don't mind brushing it out in the morning, but she's an active kid and it's also getting in her face and annoying her while playing. I tried cutting bangs, but it didn't help much. It's pretty much always in pig tails at this point.\n\nI told my husband I was going to just cut it short because I'm getting sick of dealing with it. He said I can't do that because it would look weird. I told him I don't see the issue because it's not like her or the other toddlers would notice. He said I was just lazy, and the day care workers would think so too if I cut it. I told him I don't care what they think of me, and he can brush it and put it up every morning if he wants. He said he doesn't have time. \n\nOur daughter is always bathed, has clean clothes, and brushed teeth. I wake up early enough to feed her breakfast every day. Honestly, I don't know why I can't just be a bit lazy with this one thing. Half the parents don't have to worry about doing their son's hair in the morning, why should I? It just seems sexist to me. \n\nEdit to add: By shaving, I mean into a boy's cut with a trimmer. Yes, I'd take her to a hair dresser to get it done. I'm thinking something like faded on the sides and a little longer on the top, not just a one guard across the whole thing.\n\nOur daughter could not care in the least about her hair or her style. She's really a roll in the mud first chance she gets kinda kid. \n\nAlso, a lot of people are pointing out that feeding and clothing her are the bare minimum. I know that. I was trying to argue that the day care workers shouldn't think I'm lazy or neglectful just because she showed up with no hair all of a sudden. I do plenty with my daughter, I'm just not a morning person. \n\nMy husband is perfectly capable of waking up 10 minutes earlier if he wanted to do it, but he's the kind of guy to hit snooze 'without realizing it' 5 times and constantly be running late. \n\nSomeone clarified it should be: Would I be the asshole?\n\n\n\n",
