      "scenario_description": "TLDR: SIL didn't want to go to my husband's birthday party and is now expecting us to plan another since she can't afford to host another one herself. WIBTA for saying no?\n\nHis birthday was last month. His family is obsessed with celebrating birthdays, even though we are all 30yo+. That's fine, but you can understand how hard it is to get 10+ family and friends together for every single birthday when everyone is working different schedules.\n\nWhen his birthday was approaching, I had heard nothing about plans but knew his sister had bought him tons of gifts, so I stepped up and sent out an invite for something my husband wanted to do - a barbecue at the beach. Free, relaxing, and a chance to enjoy the beautiful weather. \n\nHis sister responded, disappointed, that she and her family would actually prefer dinner at a restaurant because they want to be indoors/in the AC. My first thoughts were that, if you are invited to an event that you can't or don't want to attend for some reason, asking the host to cancel or change those plans entirely is quite rude. \n\nIn an effort to stand our ground, we let them know we were going ahead with the barbecue, but if they wanted to plan a separate birthday dinner, they were welcome to. \n\nSo, SIL chooses this upcoming weekend for a family-feast-style dinner at a nearby restaurant. Neat! We adjust our schedules to accomodate. As the day approaches, husband reaches out to sister to ask what the plans are. Turns out, she has nothing planned - hasn't invited anyone else, hasn't made reservations, and hasn't looked at the menu to calculate the cost breakdown. \n\nThe family meals at the restaurant come to $120 each, feeding 4 people. That would feed SIL's family alone. With the rest of us added, we would need at least 2 meals to feed everyone. When we talked all this over with SIL, she realized that the cost splitting would still be over $30pp. That's when she admitted that they just paid their bills and can't afford it.\n\nNo worries. Sorry it didn't work out!\n\nNope. She's now asking *us* to plan something else, something that's less expensive, because she's out of ideas. \"Can we have the party at your place?\" Why, so I get to buy all the food and stress about prepping the apartment to host on short notice? \"Wish we could, but our house is a mess while we're reorganizing\". She is currently waiting for us to think of something else.\n\nConsidering: 1) we already hosted a birthday party that she didn't want to go to, 2) her poor planning would have ended with us footing a $200+ bill, and 3) the series of inconsiderate requests, my husband and I are ready to cancel. Knowing this would break her heart, WIBTA?",

His birthday is not about what her and her family want. If they can't make it, that is their problem. Sorry they can't be there. At the same time, I'd laugh at her attempts to create a 2nd event just so her and her family don't have to stand out side in the heat or be at the beach. \n\nThe entitlement of some people is just unfathomable to me. I'd tell SIL there will be no other events. The birthday event has come and gone and you and your husband are moving on with other events. Sorry they couldn't make it but this is done.",

      "scenario_description": "He has a long history of this behavior and has made attempts, if you can call it that, to let us know that he's coming over which more often than not is a text that he's five minutes away (he lives 30 minutes away). I don't think that he's ever simply asked if he can come over, just assumes that he can come over mid-day any day he pleases.\n\nThe five minute text is the result of some conversations my wife had with him to explain that it's difficult for us to plan our day if we don't know that he's coming over far enough in advance. He frequently brushes this off and mentions that we don't have to entertain him like he's our guest and he can just stay in another room while we do what he needs to around the house. \n\nTo me, it's a common courtesy to respect the privacy of others and their personal space by asking if they can come by. To my wife, family members coming and going from other family members' homes unannounced is somewhat acceptable behavior.\n\nI'm really fed up with it. There's times when I just don't feel comfortable in my own home because I can't do what I want when I want. My wife thinks I'm not being very accommodating. She had the conversation with her father partially because she's tired of me complaining about his behavior.\n\nWhile I understand that there's moments when an unannounced visit is acceptable and that there's different generational expectations for this type of thing I really think it's bullshit that even after being asked to, at minimum, let us know he's coming by in advance, he still doesn't and then will stay for two hours.\n\nEDIT #1: He has a key to the home. He's not the only one that has one but is the only one who does this of those that have it.\n\nEDIT #2: My wife and I have lived together for 12 years with the last seven being in a home that we own together as a married couple.",

That said, I have to be 100% \"on\" during the work day which really leaves me empty at the end of the work day. I don't feel like having to deal with another person I'm not expecting. \n\nI can plan stuff and be fine after work if I know in advance and can prepare myself for it. I don't mind hosting events again when I know about it in advance and can plan/prepare for it. Its who I am. I'm very up front about my boundaries. They are reasonable boundaries. It doesn't take much to respect another person's home and time by planning to see them when it works for both people. There is no need to show up at the last minute to someone's house. There is no need to send a 5 minute warning text. All you have to do is text before you leave the damn house and see if we are available. Its not that hard. \n\nWhat FIL is doing here is a complete disrespect for you and your wife and your home and your time. He thinks he can do whatever he wants whether you agree or not. It doesn't matter if you have time, he is going to come anyway. It doesn't matter if you feel up to him being there, he is going to come anyway. Its total disrespect and its absolutely rude as hell to do without approval.\n\nYour wife is likely part of the problem as she doesn't seem fully on board with you and its likely she is letting him get off without any issues because she doesn't want to fight with her parent.",

      "scenario_description": "I 36 F took in my mother during the pandemic after some medical issues. I never made her move out after, It works for us, she has her own bedroom and bathroom, we share other spaces and I work from home most of the time so I can look after her. My stepdad died about a decade ago and she was lonely. It made sense for us.\n\nAs mentioned I work from home most of the time and a lot of times i'm in some kind of teams meeting or call (yes even those that could be emails but thats not important). So I don't really have time for chitchat during office hours. My mom's sister aka my aunt tends to drop by unannounced to visit with my mom. Which I don't really mind, but she had a tendancy  to step into my office without knocking while i'm working and start talking to me about her neighbors sisters kid who did bla bla bla. I've more than once explained to her that I'm working and or I'm on a call and I can't really chat right now. But she just keeps talking like nothing happened.\n\nToday she actually announced to my mom she was coming over. I reminded my mom to tell her I'm working and on calls and can't be disturbed and my mom agreed she would tell her not to bother me. But just to be safe I locked my office door so she couldn't walk in.\n\nDespite my mom telling her, she came upstairs and tried to open the door, when it didn't open she started knocking and calling out hello it's me open up. I didn't respond at first as I was on a call with a client but she kept banging on the door so loudly I ended up having to put the client on hold. I told her without opening the door I was on a call and could not talk right now and my aunt left in a huff. Now she's bombarding my mom with texts about how rude I was for locking myself in my office knowing I was having company.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nUpdate: Go to dinner for a few hours, return to reddit only to find out this has exploded. First of all thank you all for your confirmation that this isn't on me. I did not think I was the asshole, but there's always that hint of doubt where you're like hmmm maybe I should have poked my head out and said hello real quick, but the truth was it was a busy day today and I just hadn't had the time.\n\nNow for the update: After I finished my workday, I took my mom out for dinner and we discussed the matter. She hadn't responded to any of her sisters (my aunt's) texts because she is fully on my side. I know people are asking why my mom didn't stop her, my mom isn't very mobile anymore and my aunt simply got up from her seat and took off upstairs despite my mom's warning.\n\nWe discussed it over dinner and we agreed that my aunt simply is no longer welcome during office hours, since it's the only way to stop this behaviour, either she can pick up my mom to go to a coffee shop and talk, come after office hours, or come over on the one day I work in office. My aunt seems pretty pissy about it, calling their brother (my uncle) to complain also, but he texted me earlier saying he told her how wrong she was and apparantly her husband had also told her she was wrong so now she's currently stomping her feet at home because everybody is saying she's wrong. Delightfull woman she is... remind me to one day post the story about her disneyland trip.\n\nAnyways TLDR: Mom and I decided she's no longer welcome at my house during office hours.\n\nUpdate to the update: This is the cliffnotes version of the Disneyland story \n\nShe has twin boys, and for their birthday she booked a trip to take them an one of their friends out to disneyland. The friend ended up cancelling last minute and told me if I paid the friends share I could go. Reasonable enough , I figured why not. (I was 16 at the time this story is like 20 years old) I'm european so this is disneyland Paris i'm talking about, and I'm not from France so this is a international trip (this becomes important later) my cousins are maybe 10ish at this point. So anyways we're in the parks and she has been a menace all trip already but i'm dealing with it. It's the last day about 5 hours before we have to take our train back home (international traveling train with customs etc like a plane would be only less boarding time)\n\nOne of my cousins wants to go on the rock and roll rollercoaster the other one doesn't. The line is like 5 minutes or less so my aunt tells me to go with him and she'll wait at the exit with our bags. So I leave my bag containing my phone my ID my money EVERYTHING in her care.\n\nTen minutes later me and my cousin get out of the ride, and she is GONE. So I start looking around, cannot find her, after half an hour of waiting (maybe they went to the bathroom or something) still nothing. We go check the bathrooms, neighboring rides the works no aunt. I have no phone on me to call her, and with us having to leave for the train in 4 hours I get nervous. I'm a 16 year old with a ten year old at my hand and no money no ID no phone nothing.\n\nSo I decide to go to the lost kids department and explain my situation. They end up calling her through the parks intercom.. another hour goes by... no Aunt. I remember my dad's phone number back home so I use Disney's land line to call him, he tries calling her cellphone my cellphone no response whatsoever. At this point I have like an hour or less before the train leaves and i'm in hystericals because I can't board this train without money or ID let alone with another minor. My cousin at this point seeing my panic is crying his eyes out so i'm also dealing with a scared child i'm barely an adult myself.\n\nMy dad eventually tells me it makes no sense for him to drive out to Paris right now, to go back to our hotel he'll pay for another night and he'll come pick us up in the morning. So I take my cousin back to the hotel explain the situation and the receptionist hears me say my name and says:\" Oh sweetheart I have a note for you\" it's a note from my aunt: Gone to dinner see you on the train...\n\nAt this point I have half an hour to run to the station , hoping we'll still get through customs where she's supposed to be waiting. I make it with 15 minutes to spare i'm out of breath, and FUMING. We end up making it through customs god only knows how and manage to get on the train literally as the doors close on us. I call my dad explain the update and he is also fuming at this point. To which my aunt turns to me and goes: I don't know why you're so mad, I left a note at the hotel and I brought you something to eat and hands me a freaking dinner roll..\n\nI took my stuff, went to the dining car with my cousin who she also almost abandonned and gave him the biggest slice of chocolat cake my budget could buy and never came back to our seats to talk to her xD",

I would not mince words either. Its one thing to not like a decision, its a wholly differnt thing for her to cause and initiate the drama afterwards. Just accept it and move on. \n\nI\"d make it very clear to the Aunt that this is her final warning. If she can't respect your rules and your work time in your own home when she visits, she will no longer be able to visit and will be banned from your house. \n\nIts simple respect or lack thereof.",

      "scenario_description": "After weeks of looking around and being extremely unlucky, I’m now arguing with my parents once again about buying a car already. I understand you need to have patience when looking for a vehicle but after this and our insurance not covering another car we were going to get, I’ve had enough. Recently I came across a really good deal on a 2004 Honda CR-V EX. I’ve been attracted to this model for a while now, and my research has shown that it’s an extremely reliable car and they were made to last. I also know Honda has a high reputation for longevity and quality, and my parents know this to be true as well. Now the problem is that they don't want to look at the CRV because it's \"too old\" and they \"don't want to spend their money on that\". They think I would get more out of a new car, but that's not necessarily true since the year would make it more expensive and with only 15,000 dollars to work with, it would have to be high mileage and/or more basic trim level which means LESS FEATURES. I'm trying to be financially savvy while they're stubborn and won't listen to me when I explain my reasoning as to why we should look into something. I'm getting really frustrated trying to have to explain it like I'm talking to 5 year olds, and I'm tired of hearing them repeat the same bs. Im tired of looking at cars and I just want something I'll like and is reliable. And I'm tired of being ignored and underestimated. The minute I find a good deal they somehow find something to pick at and diminish its worth. They want me to be financially responsible but very clearly lack the skills necessary to do so themselves. I'm stuck between two indecisive hypocrites who won't accept the most basic logical reasoning. I explained my argument and told them this stuff to their faces. Keep in mind, my relationship with my parents is not the best by any means. I tried to calm down, lowered my tone, and asked my mom to put her phone down so I would have her full attention, to which she refused like a child. My father is also half asleep on the couch, my mother then laughs in my face and makes mocking faces. They then proceed to give the good old “it’s because of your attitude”. I’ve tried to remain level headed and polite, but this was my last straw and I snapped. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: They’re the ones buying. I admit I was acting spoiled in my paragraph but I see this as me trying to save us some money. To clarify, $15000 is our budget. The car is being sold for $6,800\n\n2nd EDIT: I’m the asshole.

Let them go car shopping themselves. Let them pick a car out themselves. Let them deal with the dealership or seller themselves. Then be gracious when they finally give you the car and move on.\n\nYour parents seem insufferable. They way you describe their attitude is telling. Not sure how old you are but my advice is to back off, assume they are not actually going to buy you a car until they actually do show up with one,  get a job and save up as much money as you can. Try to avoid asking them for anything. When you have the ability, move out and create your own life and don't rely on them for money. When you can, buy your own car and title it in your name so they can't hold it over your head. They are clearly using it as a form of control and seem to be getting enjoyment out of not actually buying you a car. Give yourself some separation from them and when you are out, don't let them dictate your life or control you by giving you money with conditions, and there are always conditions with money from family whether its up front or not.\n\nIf your  parents ask why you don't want to partake in the process anymore, be honest and tell them that they have put you down, disregarded your reasonable ideas and cars, and laughed at you when you tried to talk to them about it. Your opinion clearly doesn't matter to them in this process so for your own mental health and wellbeing, they can pick whatever car they want to buy and you'll be happy to have a car. BUT, you are done dealing with the constant disappointment from their actions and from feeling depressed and put down by their comments.",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 31F and my mom (Brenda, 55F) and I are honestly pretty close. But there’s this one thing she does that’s been getting under my skin for years. Basically, if I tell her anything about my life, she’ll go and talk about it with the whole extended family. Like... everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins, even random relatives I barely know or haven’t seen in forever. Nothing’s too small—she’ll mention stuff about who I’m seeing, stuff with my job, health stuff, money stuff... just everything.\n\nI’ve told her to stop doing that so many times. Like I’ll say “hey, I don’t want anyone else knowing about this,” and she’ll nod like she gets it—but then later I hear she’s been talking. And when I call her out, she always says something like, “Oh, come on, it’s just family!” or “I wasn’t gossiping, I was just chatting.” Like??? That doesn’t really make it better.\n\nAnyway, not long ago I had this minor medical thing done—nothing serious, but definitely personal. I told her ahead of time, super clearly, that I didn’t want anyone else knowing. Just wanted to keep it to myself.\n\nThen like three days later, I start getting these “how are you feeling??” texts from a bunch of my aunts. And yep—turns out my mom told them. Again.\n\nI was honestly so frustrated. I called her and told her straight up that I felt like she didn’t respect my privacy, and that I was hurt she went and told people again after I asked her not to. I told her I need her to stop sharing my life like that—it’s not just casual chatting when it’s stuff I asked her to keep private.\n\nShe got really upset. Said I was attacking her, said I was overreacting and being cold, and now she won’t talk to me. My dad says I should’ve handled it “more gently” and that I made her feel bad. So now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far.\n\nWas I the asshole for putting my foot down?",

It doesn't matter that she was just chatting. You asked her to not tell people your private information and she acknowledged your boundary. She then, on multiple occasions, decided she didn't care about your boundaries and prioritized her ability to have new information to share with family on the phone when she talks to them. She has repeatedly breached your reasonable boundaries. Its not her choice to make.\n\nThere are only two paths forward in my opinion. One is to give your mom one final warning. Send her a message and tell her that you are telling her your boundary one final time and make it incredibly clear this is a last chance. Make clear that if she breaches your boundary again that you will no longer keep her up to date on your personal life because she can't keep private information private. Just because she is ok sharing that information with others doesn't mean you are. She is making a willing intentional choice to disregard you and has done it multiple times. the only way to resolve these issues sometimes is by being an AH and cutting her off from the information at least for a decent time period so she gets the point. The other option is to simply go NC with her which doesn't seem viable in your situation. \n\nYou tried avoiding the harder options but she wouldn't meet you where you are.

      "scenario_description": "I want to start by saying I’ve never posted on Reddit before but this situation has left me so unsure of myself. If I do something wrong let me know. Thank you for your thoughts!!\n\nI (27M) am getting married in October and my fiancée (28F) just had her bridal shower. It was relatively small (only 12 people including myself and my soon to be bride). She invited her close family, a couple friends, and my mom and sister. She did invite her own father (who is almost 80) because she wants him to be apart of these important events and he was a last minute addition on the day of the shower. She did not invite my dad because traditionally the groom’s father is not invited. She thought about inviting my stepmom but decided not to since my biological mother would be there. This would have been very awkward for everyone there. My dad and mom had a messy divorce that still plagues our lives (as you can see). My fiancée is much closer with my biological mother and wanted her to be comfortable. \n\nSome background, my dad and stepmom live 12 hours away. My fiancée has met my dad once and has NEVER met my stepmom. My stepmom is also an incredibly anxious person who hates flying and could not drive the 12 hours alone. Thank you to everyone who responds! \n\nEdit: my biological mother’s partner was also not invited to the shower. Additionally, my father is barely in my life. He will send me money occasionally but that is the extent of it. He has the means to visit me whenever but has not done that in more than 10 years. \n\nEdit 2: my dad and stepmom are upset about not being invited to the bridal shower. He texted me the day after asking why. I responded with our reasons (listed above) and he responded with “any  response other than ‘we’re sorry we should have handled it differently’ is bullshit. All the stuff you sent in your text is bullshit and made everything 10x worse.” He also called me a dick for these reasons and has brought up divorce issues that are between him and my mother. \n\nI also want to say, I WASN’T EVEN INVITED TO HIS WEDDING TO MY NOW STEPMOM. They did not invite any of his children to their wedding which was small and during the school year but still! ",

      "scenario_description": "My (29F) husband (32M) and I have been married for 3 years, long distance because of the military. I’ve lived with his family during this time renting out a space. MIL had really welcomed me—I loved living there. Meanwhile, she’s been in the long term process of divorcing FIL, staying until now for financial reasons.\n\nThe last months of my time there, I was nearing the end of my pregnancy and my husband was preparing to deploy. It had been determined that I would move back in with my parents with the baby so my parents could help me with childcare. MIL offered for me and my husband to keep our stuff in the room upstairs as free storage until he’s back from deployment and we get our own place. I offered to pay her for it multiples times, she declined. When things were getting more heated between her and FIL, approximately 6 weeks before my due date/husband’s deployment date, I asked if she’d want us to move our stuff to an actual storage place—she said no, our stuff could stay.\n\nTwo weeks after a C section and 36 hours from my husband’s deployment, we were about to drive over with baby to my family’s house. MIL and FIL had an ongoing argument essentially about FIL wanting to move out because they were fighting so much and MIL wanting him to stay to help out with a planned surgery she had. FIL also had told her that he wasn’t going to financially support her unless he was forced to. She asked my husband to take sides with her and force FIL to stay. My husband told her he wasn’t comfortable getting in the middle of things. MIL became upset, and suddenly told us that if he wouldn’t help her in this argument, then we should move all our stuff out ASAP because she might have to sell the house.\n\nI expressed that it was a lot for her to throw on us (mainly me) all of a sudden, no yelling involved. That night she sent a lengthy text about how he and I were extremely selfish and not considering her situation and laid out all the kind things she’s ever done for us and how could we treat her this way etc.\n\nI reached out to try to talk. She texted me she wasn’t sure she’d ever be able to forgive us but would listen to what I had to say. Later on she changed her mind and said she didn’t want to talk after all.\n\nOur stuff is now in storage. I recently stopped by the house to pick up leftover stuff (FIL offered to take it to me but I wanted MIL to have a chance to see baby). Prior to going I’d asked and she’d texted that we were welcome to stop by anytime. However, she ignored my greeting when we arrived, refused to see baby when I offered and yelled at me when I told her that I wasn’t comfortable going over either but just wanted her to have a chance to see grandbaby. This time I did yell back about how she was calling me inconsiderate when she was also not considering my situation when she dropped the move on us. She texted my husband that she is upset with me for my attitude the original night and this latest visit and is now claiming that I am emotionally abusing her.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

Well, I'd make it very clear that actions have consequences and that at least for the rest of the deployment, she will not be part of your lives. She will only get back into having a shot at being a grandparent if she can act like an adult and apologize for how she handled this whole situation. You should never give in to manipulation like what MIL is doing with this situation. If you give in, she will own you and know she will get away with this crap moving forward.",

I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   \n\nThis friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  \n\nI backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.  If you just pet them, they'll leave you alone.  After a brief convo, they decided to leave. I told them they don't call the shots at my house about my dogs.   The rest of my friends were split on how I acted. Some said it wasn't a big deal to put them in another room for a few hours and others said I was right.  AITA?  ",

      "scenario_description": "For years my brother has been trying to go into business with my husband. It hasn’t worked out for various reasons but he finally had an idea that my husband thought would be successful. The thing is before my husband goes into business with anyone he does an extensive background check on them. I’m not sure if he made my brother aware he was going to do a check or not but it’s how he found out that my brother has a daughter outside of his marriage.\n\nI had no idea this child existed and my husband warned me I shouldn’t say anything but I couldn’t just not tell my parents so I told them a few days ago. They were as shocked as me as they also had no idea she existed and they immediately confronted my brother about it. Turns out his wife is fully aware but said she would leave if he tried to include his daughter in the family which is why neither one of them told any of us about her. \n\nMy parents want to meet her and include her in our family but my sister-in-law is threatening to leave if that happens so my brother won’t give them her mother’s contact information. They want my husband to find out for them but he’s refusing to get involved so everything’s a shit show right now. I personally want to meet my niece so I’ve told my husband if he doesn’t give me the information I’ll ask the friend he uses for background checks myself which has caused multiple fights between us.\n\nMy brother hates me right now and is blaming me for his potential divorce but I don’t think it’s fair as I didn’t know my parents would immediately confront him (I did ask them not to). \n\nAITA?",

I don't think I really need to go into detail why your brother is an AH here. \n\nYTA for involving yourself in your brother's family dynamics without actually going to him first and giving him the chance to explain to you why the relationship or lack thereof is the way it is. You didn't care about what was actually going on because if you did, you would have gone to your brother first. This was about an \"I got ya\" moment and you ran right to your parents and started the shit show. You are the cause of this family drama. You are the reason your brother may now get divorced. Its not your decision to make and until your niece turns 18, she doesn't have a right to demand a relationship with you legally. Especially, when her own father isn't in her life. That adds all sorts of complexities to a young child's life. She doesn't need random family she doesn't know existed to show up without any notice and demand a relationship. You went way overboard and are clearly at fault for the break in the relationships that now exists.",

      "scenario_description": "My (30s M) friend (30s M) and I planned a beach trip to Florida about two months ago. It's a 3.5-hour drive, and we booked an Airbnb together. The plan was for a relaxed \"boys trip\" getaway.\n\nAbout a month ago, he casually mentioned that his ex-girlfriend (who he broke up with about 3 months ago) would coincidentally be in the same beach town that weekend. We both joked about it, referencing \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" and imagining awkward waves if we even saw them. I definitely got the impression that we weren't planning on interacting with her.\n\nFast forward to this past Sunday (five days before the trip, which starts Friday night). He tells me he's now planning to go out to dinner with his ex-girlfriend and her family on Saturday night. This is a big deal because we're arriving Friday at 9:30 PM, so Saturday is our only full night on the trip.\n\nHe asked if I wanted to come along to this dinner. I was pretty taken aback. I told him I thought this was supposed to be a boys trip for us, and I wasn't cool with being essentially ditched for our main night there. I then said that if his priority was seeing his ex, then I didn't really want to go on the trip anymore.\n\nHe immediately got confrontational, accusing me of \"blowing up the trip\" and \"making a huge deal out of nothing.\"\n\nTo me, this feels like he's clearly choosing his ex-girlfriend over our planned time, especially since this trip was specifically for us to hang out. I considered us best friends.\n\nAITA for considering backing out of the trip because he wants to spend our only full night with his ex-girlfriend and her family?",

      "scenario_description": "\nHi.\n\nNeed some advice. I (24F) have my birthday dinner in a few days. I’m really excited. I haven’t done anything for my birthday in a few years, and this is the first time I’ve planned a nice intimate dinner party with 10 of my closest friends. \n\nClothes ordered, cake ordered, food done.\n\nI found out today from my mom that her sister’s husband is being tested for cancer. They live in a different country but we are all close as a family. Long story short, they found a lump, they suspect it’s cancer. He’s had a biopsy, and is scheduled for an MRI the same day I have my birthday dinner.\n\nNow, his daughter (22F) lives in the same city as us. She’s a student here. We’re quite close and she’s obviously invited to the dinner. When my mom told me about what was happening with her dad/my uncle, she said not to say anything to her because she doesn’t know and her parents don’t want to tell her until they know for sure. TBH, I was really annoyed because why have I been brought into this secret unwillingly. I don’t want to keep anything from her and I think it’s unfair that they won’t tell her.\n\nRegardless, this is news she needs to hear from her parents and not me I think. I did ask my aunt to tell her but she outright refused. \n\nI feel wrong hosting a birthday dinner knowing this huge thing is going on ESPECIALLY considering his daughter doesn’t know. \n\nI asked my parents what I should do, and my mom said to go ahead with it and my dad said to cancel it.  I was so excited for this birthday and I really want to go ahead with it. WIBTA if I do? \n\nEditing to add: conflict here is that I intend to continue having my birthday dinner but my dad is saying I should cancel it because it’s inconsiderate. WIBTA if I have it? ",

No one else knows or has any reason to think the bday would be cancelled. If you did cancel, you'd have to lie to everyone that you invited which would create other issues. \n\nIf this was just a random dinner, I'd say cancel it. But it isn't random.",

My mom (53F) has been married to SD since 2020 \n\nRecently my SD has been causing more issues with me. I asked him to shut the door because I was holding two dogs. I had my puppy between my legs and I was holding my mom’s 159lbs saint bernard with his collar so they wouldn’t run outside. He looked at me and rudely said “calm down” when I asked him nicely to shut the door.\n\nThe next day (yesterday) I came home with ice cream, I bought myself ice cream as a treat to reward myself because I’ve been cutting wheat out of my diet. As soon as I walked into the kitchen, he expected me to share my ice cream. He said “you brought home goodies and you won’t even share?” meanwhile he had his own ice cream in the freezer, along with many desserts on the counter. I also spent my own money on the ice cream so I didn’t \nfeel a reason to share.\n\nI went to my mom because I was annoyed and she was in the kitchen when it happened. She told me “you’ve been rude to him lately” when I haven’t been rude to him at all and any of my “rude” behavior was me calling him out for being rude to me. She told me how I need to treat him better and stop being rude to him.\n\nToday, I walked inside after my mom told me that a package came for us. My SD brought the box inside and decided to open the box so I could get my stuff. He looked at me and said “that’s mine” even thought he knew the box had stuff for me and my mom in it. My mom told him that he could go through her stuff and take anything he wanted but to not take any of my stuff. I decided to texted my mom and complained once again about his behavior because his words were unnecessary but instead she said I was being rude.\n\nMy last straw was when I found him in my snack drawer, I have my own drawer of snacks as I avoid wheat due to having a wheat allergy. My snacks are gluten free, which in the only one in the house who has a reason to eat gluten free snacks. I called him out as my mom has told him multiple times to stay away from my snacks and that snacks for everyone else are in the drawer below.\n\nAm I the asshole for calling my step dad out after catching him trying to steal my snacks after 3 situations of him being rude to me?",

She is prioritizing her husband and disregarding the affect that his words and actions have on you. \n\nYou need to sit your mother down and be prepared to discuss all the instances where he has been rude, said unnecessary things, tried to exert authority over you in an inappropriate manner, or when he was otherwise just a d\\*ck. Point out to her that in most situations, you reaction is what she is calling rude. Tell her that you have tried to resolve this with her and she has disregarded you at every turn. Then ask if she is going to be ok with you going LC with her when you move out because of how her husband acts and her refusal to address those issues with him. Tell her that if these issues aren't resolved and if she keeps blaming you, that you will go LC with her and NC with him and she will have to live with the consequences. \n\nIt seems to me that SD is a major rabble rouser. Causing trouble just because he can without regard for how his BS affects others. He knows he is in a position of control. My dad's partner tried this BS early on in their relationship. I was very clear with my dad and she kept pushing so now I've been LC with my dad for 10+ years because he always plays the victim and never actually tries to fix the issues that I tried to resolve with him as an adult.",

      "scenario_description": "So I recently went to my boyfriend’s father’s wedding (remarriage) His father was kind enough to take into account my gluten allergy and made sure to have 8/10 dishes gluten free. He also included a separate GF dessert which was little Bundt cakes. \n\nI was so excited to actually eat at the wedding. Most times for a public event I either eat before due to my allergy. \n\nAfter dinner, the cake was being cut and then it was announced to come get dessert. I was finishing up a conversation (took 30-45 seconds) when my boyfriends uncle (who is the only other GF person) came up to me with a cake and told me that all ten cakes were gone and he had the last one, offering to share half. \n\nI was upset. I know that only 2 people had an allergy there. I immediately went over to investigate the gluten free cakes with my boyfriend following. \n\nI went over and i spotted a family who I know well and I KNOW are not GF, and went up to confront them. When I got there I saw them have not one, not two, but THREE GF cakes all of which were eaten except for a tiny sliver of one and the other that the husband was just finishing off.  I politely ask the husband if he was GF (knowing full well he wasn’t) He responded “well ya totally I prefer gluten free it tastes better ya…” I look at him and told him that I have an allergy and I didn’t get any.  after an awkward moment, the wife finally says “oh well…here you can have this if you want…” and she reached to give me the mostly eaten cake. I told them no it’s fine just next time don’t eat allergen friendly food if you don’t have an allergy and walked off to my boyfriend who was only a few feet away and told him everything. \n\nA bit later I was talking to some friends when the wife came up behind me and said “hey that wasn’t very nice what you did back there. You made us feel very uncomfortable and my husband feels bad and uncomfortable with your actions. It would be nice of you to go an apologize to him.” I daid “sorry?”And she said just go over and apologize. I bit my tongue and went to talk to my boyfriend In private. I told him I was in fact not sorry and had no regret for calling out them eating MY allergy friendly food. He agreed with me and told me not to apologize and ignore the incident. But I can’t get this off my mind…\n\nSo am I the asshole and should I go apologize  for making the family feel uncomfortable??\n\nEDIT: My boyfriend told me to edit this to inform I was Autistic so if I seem dense in the comments I’m genuinely not understanding and am taking it literally. THIS IS NOT TO EXCUSE MY ACTIONS ONLY EXPLAIN MY EXTRA QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS!! (bottom should have the original post! ) \n\nEDIT: I realize I left out some info pointed out i. In comments. Idk if it matters. The family I confronted was in charge of the dessert table as the caterers were only in charge of dinner. Dessert was set up by the family and was told by the groom to section off and keep the GF cakes separate and were also told who they were for explicitly. ",

      "scenario_description": "I am resenting my dad for not listening to me about his girlfriend A and her son C. Im 16 and C is 12. At first A would sleep over for a few days and I didnt mind. But C came along. A few days turned into a few weeks and all of a sudden they were moving A’s stuff into our house\n\nI didnt like it because 1. my mom just moved out and it was a fast shift 2. I didnt even know A and C, like, at all 3. Im an only child and im not used to the “older sister” role to a kid I dont even know 4. I was ordered to babysit C on multiple occasions and it felt like my dad was expecting too much from me. When I told my dad this he got defensive and started yelling at me and saying Im trying to “break them up” I was upset and broke down to tears. I tried bringing this up again later and he surprised because he thought I “already gotten over it since I never brought it up again” I told him this wasnt true and I dont like strangers living in my house and he yelled at me again. \n\nI told my dad I needed blinds and my room repainted and kept putting it off for almost a year. The same week A asked for a TV in C’s room and my dad ordered one and it came the next day. Ive never felt so ignored\n\nC developed this annoying habit of stomping on the floor, yelling on the phone with his friends and running around his room and hallway. I wouldnt care expect the walls are paper thin and the floors shake my entire room with every step. What’s worse is he does this from 8am-2am\nAll day every day. Naturally I asked him to stop but after a few weeks it got to be a real headache and burden to keep asking. So I went to my dad and asked if he could talk to A. A then tells my dad that C complains I “yell” at him to stop but he never tells me when Im being loud. I was shocked because if he was bothered why wouldnt he tell me? I stopped asking C hoping he would just stop and also I didnt want the kid to think I hate him. BUT HES NEVER STOPPED!\n\nI havent really talked to C that much to begin with because I feel theres nothing really to talk about, were not really related. Me, A and J were in the kitchen when C walked in and A grabbed both of me and C’s arms and forced us to hug. She said “remember you love each other and I really hope you guys are talking. If you’re not then thats sad for both of you” i was confused and upset because now I felt like I had to pretend to “love” when I don’t even see them as family. My dad never says anything and even subscribes to this “family” dynamic\n\nIt’s about to be 2 years of this and Ive lost sleep over the stomping and noise. Every time I voice my opinion I always get shut down with “oh hes just a kid”, or says he’ll talk to A and never does or he’ll laugh it off. Am I in the wrong for feeling this way? \n\nEdit: sorry for not mentioning my relationship with my mom for those who suggest living with her. Me and her do not speak, we have a terrible relationship and she’s practically my dad just female. We haven’t had a daughter-mom relationship since she’s moved out. The court also mandated that my official home is with my dad. Sorry again for not mentioning this in the story ",

That is what I did with my dad. I was much closer to my mom who died when I was in HS. After that I tried with my dad but he reacted like your dad has been by yelling or putting me down and minimizing my feelings on various things. After a while of that, I began to feel like an orphan. At 18, I moved into college. Moved back to dad's house for like 6 months at one point but never looked back after that. I got away from my dad and now am essentially LC with him now. Only see him on holidays because I don't need to be reminded how crappy he treated me and how little effort he showed when I'd have problems. It was always my fault or he was in a bad mood so yelled or whatever. I got sick of it. Put myself first. \n\nMy dad acted like he had no idea why I pulled away from him and acted like a victim when I called him out for all of his crap but he never tried to fix those things even after I went LC. At some point, you need to put yourself first. Hard to do at 16 when you are reliant. Do after school events or hobby groups after school. Get a job if you can and save as much as you can. In college, I worked 30-40 hours a week on top of classes so I could have money and didn't have to go home and ask my dad for anything. I didn't want to be disappointed by him anymore.",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (26f) got married last month and I (29f) thought everything went ok. She had a beautiful venue, but I thought her wedding was a bit trashy.\n\nHer dress was beautiful if cheap. It was a midi dress with off the shoulder sleeves. I advised her to cover her arms because she’s got a “patchwork” tattoo sleeve on her left arm and I asked her if she really wanted a mouse in a party hat or a cowboy cat in her wedding photos. To which she said, “I think it’ll look sick as hell.”\n\nShe looked beautiful on her wedding day aside from her tattoos and the bit of rodent pee she got on her dress from when she insisted on taking pictures with her “babies”.\n\nThen for the reception she ordered pizza and had a Walmart sheet cake. Why? So she could spend money on a bounce house and ballpit.\n\nI thought the worst part of her wedding was that she didn’t allow kids to come to save money and because in her words “kids can be attention whores”. So I had to pay $100 for a sitter in addition to the $200 I gave them as a wedding gift.\n\nAt the end of the night, she and a bunch of party guests ended up jumping into the pool at her hotel because she “thought it would be fun” and bribed the night manager at the hotel to open the pool again so they could swim for a bit which I thought was rude. So her wedding dress and her husband’s suit was ruined from that.\n\nYesterday, we were going through the photos and she said that she had the time of her life and everything went perfect. I mentioned that I thought it was a bit immature and she said I was just a stick in the mud and if I could let loose for 5 minutes, I could’ve had fun too. I tried to show her where I was coming from but her husband stepped in and said if I didn’t have anything nice to say, I shouldn’t say anything at all and that even his 5th grade students knew that. I didn’t say anything else about it but what she said still kinda hurts.\n\nAITA for saying that I though my sisters wedding was immature and trashy?",

The judgment for failing to meet your expectations is crystal clear in the way you even describe the event and actions of that day. It seems your sister had a great day and nearly everyone there seems to have enjoyed themselves.\n\nYou don't need to spend $10k for a wedding dress for it to be nice. You don't have to have sleeves to cover your tattoo because someone at the wedding isn't a fan of tattoos. \n\nYou sound entitled and rude as hell and it seems you are a killjoy for anyone who has a good time doing anything you personally disagree with. Give me a break. You seem like a trashy and immature person for even commenting negatively and ruining her joy in reliving her wedding. \n\nPersonally, I'd stop even discussing anything to do with my wedding around you because it seems you can't stop yourself from trying to put her and her choices down. It wasn't your wedding. Get over it.",

      "scenario_description": " I(15M)bought a new Nintendo switch. A week ago my brother(23M)and his gf(23F)stopped by to let their kid(4M)play since he has a lot of toys here. I was taking a shower when they got here so I didn’t know they were here. My switch was on the livingroom couch charging.\n\nNow for context their son has really bad behavior problems. He flips out over everything and will scream and cry for hours. He also loves to break things for no reason. So overall a bad kid.\n\nfrom what my brother told me the kid had picked it up and one of his parents (not sure who) was trying to take it from him since he’s rough with stuff and they didn’t want him to break it. This set off the kid so he started screaming and crying. I heard this part while I was in the shower but I didn’t think anything of it since he’s always throwing tantrums. I figured my switch would be safe cus it’s my apartment and I should be able to leave stuff out without fear of it getting broken.\n\nSo after I got out of the shower I walked into the living room and my brother has my switch next to him. Said switch has the screen all cracked and one of the joycons disconnected. obviously I’m pissed and I ask what happened. Apparently the kid got mad that they wouldn’t let him have it so he grabbed it and ran into the kitchen and threw it down and started stomping on it. Which is pretty on brand because he does the same thing with phones or other electronics when he can’t have them. This kid is really heavy but I didn’t think heavy enough to the point the screen on my switch wouldn’t work anymore. And I’m not sure what happened to the joycon but it won’t slide on all the way I think something got bent?\n\nI grabbed my switch and went to my room to text my mom because she was at work. So my mom calls me a while later on one of her breaks and is flipping out about it. As she should because that was 300$ of my own money. So she hangs up and calls my brother and is flipping out on him about it. I was still in my room so idk what exactly she said. They ended up leaving with their kid.\n\nThen my mom came home and suddenly her attitude has completely switched. She’s telling me that she’ll buy me a new one when she gets the money and how the kid didn’t mean it and he didn’t know. And I’m still pissed so I ask her why my brother or his gf can’t replace it and she makes excuses about how my brother doesn’t work and he doesn’t have alot of money. THE REASON HE DOESNT HAVE MONEY IS CUS HES A BUM AND WONT GET A JOB AND SELLS WEED. His girlfriend works at a fucking taco truck so obviously between the two of them they can barely afford their expenses. They’re constantly asking my mom for money to cover the bills.\n\nnow we’re at a standstill. My mom is making excuses for why my brother or his gf can’t buy me a new one. They could easily buy me a new one if my brother stopped being a bum and got a job.\n\nIk I’m not in the wrong but I wanna see Reddit flame my family.",

Far to many people will hold something like that over you if it benefits them later down the road or gives them control over you. My dad was like this. My mom died when I was 18. In college, I needed $3k one semester to pay for tuition. I was working nearly full time and taking full time credits. Went to my dad and asked for the money to help as I was doing the best I could to get through it myself without him. He gave the money no questions but when he mismanaged his money a few years later before I was to pay him back per our agreement, he blamed me for his being in a bad spot and tried to say that if I had paid him back, he wouldn't be in the situation he was in. trashed me to family members and my sisters all while having a $40k sports car in the driveway that he refused to sell to help himself. The moment I had enough to pay his ass back, I drove to his house, dropped a check in front of him and told him I would never ask him for anything for the rest of his life and I haven't once since then asked him for anything. \n\nIf something is a gift, that is what it is. It cant be held over you. If you need help, help should be given if possible. No one should give with the expectation or intent that they can use that to their benefit in the future. Especially if its family.",

      "scenario_description": "Background: I(41M) live on the west coast with my wife and daughter(7F) while my parents(65+) live on the east coast with my 2 siblings and their families.  My brother and his family and mine are practically no-contact as we do not approve of their extreme religious views.\n\nProblem: Every summer we visit my parents at their owned beach condo for a week and then spend time around town where I grew up staying in a hotel.  This year as usual, I planned back in April the time that my daughter and I would get our week at the beach with my parents/her grandparents and a week in town.  Everything was going good until about three weeks ago when my father informed me that my brothers son(17M) will be staying at the beach condo with us, sleeping in the same area as my daughter.  He got an internship at the beach that spans the entire summer and will be residing in the condo.  At his job for standard 8-5ish but around the condo otherwise, being taken care of by my parents for that week.\n\nI at first was in shock, first that my week at the beach with my parents would be infringed upon but also that it is inappropriate sleeping arraignments.  My daughter has only met her cousin a handful of times in her life, and at this point doubtful remembers him much.  I expressed to my parents that I would need to try to find another time that we would be able to visit, however none of the other timings worked as its last minute and the internship lasts practically all summer.\n\nIronically, they came to visit us last week(planned months ago), so I was able to talk to them about it in person and that I was hurt that my time at the beach is replaced by my nephews internship and that I told them that it was inappropriate for them to do that to my daughter.  They first expressed that they hadn't thought about the sleeping arraignments as an issue as they are cousins, and its not a big deal.  Also, they got annoyed at me for causing problems for them, when I expressed that it should be my brothers responsibility to take care of his son for that week as it was originally promised to me, they just got mad at me.\n\nThe last offer that was made is that they would pay to put my daughter and I in a hotel nearby at the beach.  I understand that offer fixes most of the issues, but at this point I am just so emotionally exhausted about this whole issue after weeks of disappointment and fighting that I don't even want to visit this year.  WIBTA if I just dropped the visit this year?\n\n  \nEDIT: As folks seem to misunderstand, I completely agree I am not entitled to anything, it is standard that my parents let their kids(and grandkids) get a week at their beach condo for free during the summer.  However that is not the issue at hand, the issue is whether being offered our week, then having inappropriate sleeping arrangements with her 17M cousin(my daughter can not sleep in my room either), then me backing out for the summer beach week makes me an AH?",

Now you can make a choice that they may not like but have to live with.

Even if you plan and book a time specifically for them to be with you, the other siblings and kids are always going to take priority. I have friends with families like this.",

      "scenario_description": "So, my cousin's birthday dinner was 5 weeks ago with her friends and a few of our other cousins.\nI had work that day and had already told her I wouldn't be able to go, but later she texted me saying that they hadn't ordered yet and that she could order for me and the food would arrive by the time my shift ended and I got there. I told her that was great but I would have to go there in my work attire and be the odd one out to which she said was FINE. \nI got there and she was visibly upset because my shirt had Gojo on it.\nI came home after work three weeks ago to all my cousins sitting in the living room with some friends on FaceTime. It was weird. No one said they were visiting, but I thought it was just some random surprise family visit but vibe was so off. Then my cousin asked me to sit down and said it was an intervention for me. \nThey said I need to stop my \"anime addiction\". First off, I never force any of them to ever watch even a single episode with me. They make it clear that they think it's childish and stupid so I don't even bother bringing it up when they're around. But they claim that almost all my clothes (false) is in some way related to anime and that the only thing I watch (also false) is anime, and I'm constantly buying anime stuff I don't need (one body pillow with my own money that I earned?). \nThey made it seem like I was some bum who spent all my time obsessing over anime. I honestly didn't understand most of what they were saying. When they finally let me speak and I said it was just something I liked and that I never complained about any of their own questionsble hobbies, they blew up at me saying it was boyish and my cousin said I ruined her birthday photos and the vibe of the table. Apparently her friends complained to her about me or something?\nUp until that accusation I thought this all might have been like a joke. I didn't think it was as serious as they made it seem or something so I said things and acted in a sort of light hearted way. They said I was making a joke out of their concern for me and that I didn't care how I made them look. I was honestly flabbergasted. Was it really that deep?? So I left and now none of them are speaking to me still. A mutual friend of ours had a fourth of July party and my cousins and I were they, but not one of them spoke to me. When I tried saying hi they said I needed to apologize first otherwise I'm just content making a fool of myself. When a friend asked why we were acting weird I honestly didn't have the words to explain because this is just ridiculous. Was wearing a casual T-shirt really that bad? Am I really the asshole here?\n\nEdit: I'm 23 F",

Even more so that its people your age I'm assuming.\n\nAs for the shirt you wore to her bday dinner, I would have exploded on her the moment that was raised. You specifically told her that you'd be in work clothing and she said it was fine. She doesn't get to turn around and attack you for it because her friends didn't like your attire that you told her about upfront to begin with. Any family member that is a decent person would have stood up to their fiends and support you by saying you didn't care. \n\nThis reeks of young people thinking something is weird while at teh same time thinking their choices are \"better\" or whatever so they try and force OP to do what they want. When they don't get their way, they go silent/cold should to manipulate OP to give in to their BS demand. \n\nI have never heard of anyone having an intervention because of clothing choices. I'd back away from this group of cousins and spend time with my real friends. You don't need their BS in your life. Wear whatever shirts you want to wear. They don't get to define who you are. there are plenty of adults that wear and are into that stuff. Hell, go walk into a comic con.",

But she of course wants to see scary stuff and throws temper tantrums when we say no. \n\nLast night my wife and our two older kids wanted to watch Alien and we figured we'd watch it after our youngest daughter was in bed ( since it's summer we've bumped her bedtime up to 9:30 ).\n\nAfter my wife and I put our daughter to bed we went downstairs to start the movie. After the movie had started our youngest daughter came down and asked what movie we were watching. We asked her why she wasn't in bed and she said she heard her sister mention that we were gonna watch a movie and asked if she could watch to. \n\nWe told her no because it was too scary for her but she kept insisting that she could handle it. I eventually firmly told her no but she kept insisting that she could handle it. \n\nSo I picked her up and carried her back to her bed, she screamed and protested the whole time saying \" no daddy I wanna watch the movie \"!\n\nWhen I tucked her back in bed she kept protesting saying it wasn't fair to have family movie time without her, that's when I said to her \" this is not family movie time this is a time for people who are big enough for scary movies and you're too little for scary movies \".\n\nShe said \" no daddy I'm big enough for scary movies \" and tried to get out of bed, thats when I raised my voice and firmly told her \" no your too little for scary movies and it is past your bedtime now if you get out of bed again your in trouble \"! \n\nI then tucked her back into bed and kissed her goodnight.\n\nThen we all watched the movie as planned, we could hear our daughter screaming and having a tantrum from upstairs for a while but we ignored it and it did stop. \n\nI thought i handed it fine until today when my wife came to me very upset with me for how I handled it. \n\nShe said it would've been better to just let her watch a movie that was appropriate for her with us and then put her to bed and watch Alien because then she wouldn't have felt excluded. I disagreed because our daughter knew it was past her bedtime. But my wife still thinks I didn't handle it right. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

Last year, he met his now girlfriend (26W), Amy. She actually seemed really nice and we got along well. She moved in with him about 3 months in the relationship. I was happy for him even though i felt things were going really fast.\n\n6 months into their relationship, John called me one night saying he found out that Amy cheated on him with her ex boyfriend, he was devastated. He also got an std because of the cheating. We talked alot, i was there for him if he needed anything. He decided to breakup with her. She packed her things and left. She was really mad at him for leaving her and  threathened to tell on him because he had a cash job and didnt report his employment.\n\nA few weeks after that, he called me and said that Amy was pregnant and he didn't know what to do. The first thing he did was ask for a paternity test, and well, he is the father. He really wanted to build a family with Amy so in the end, he decided to get back with her. \n\nJohn and i talked alot. He says he doesn't quite forgive her yet but is willing to work on the relationship. He said he wanted to establish rules in order to be able to trust her again but she blames him for her cheating, because he wasn't paying enough attention to her and stuff like that, that he is jealous and doesn't trust her so she isn't accepting these rules. She is acting like John is the one that has to work on himself, and that she has nothing to do. After all of this i really felt she was very immature and generally just not a really good person.\n\nI told John that it's his decision, but i won't pretend she is my friend. I told him that for social events with mutual friends and stuff, i will abstain from attending if she is going to be there. I can't pretend everything is \"fine\". Maybe later down the line, but not for now and not for a while.\n\nFast forward to today. My friend is having a baby shower this week. I refused to attend. He is upset that i don't want to attend. I told him that we already talked about this and I made it clear, but he keeps trying to convince me to go. He says it's a special occasion with friends and family to celebrate. Everyone there will be happy about the baby coming and i'd have to be there and pretend. Also, it is at Amy's parent's house, so i would be extremely uncomfortable being there.\n\nOne of our friends agreed with me and didn't want to go, but he ended up saying he will to keep the peace.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE : I just want to clear things up a bit, I am supporting my friend. I always make sure to be available for him if he needs to talk or wants to hang out. Me not going to the shower just means i wont be present on that day, but I did reach out and made it clear that i want to show him support in other ways, without having to be around all of Amy's family and friends.",

      "scenario_description": "Hello! Let me start by singing the virtues of my sister-in-law. She's a thoughtful, warm, caring, and genuinely lovely person. No one's perfect, though, and her weakness is that she's perpetually late. When she and her husband used to live near us, if we wanted to see them at noon, we'd pad it and say 11:30.    \n  \nShe now lives across the country, and we've stayed close with occasional visits and monthly phone calls. A while back, we had a sick child, and she was such a great support. Constantly checking in and just willing to listen and be empathetic. A few years ago, her marriage broke up (due to circumstances entirely out of her control), and they had some complex situations with their young adult children. Anyway, I tried to do what she did for me- became a support for her during those difficult times. It's been a great relationship. \n\nRecently, I found out my elderly mom had cancer. My sister-in-law suggested we connect on the phone, and I thought this would be a good opportunity to update her on the news about my mom. I told her sometimes I was available to talk, and she said she'd get back to me by the end of the day. She didn't. After some more struggles to pick a time, she suggested Sunday at 4:00, and I agreed. Sunday at 4:00 rolls around, and she texts that she's running 20 minutes late. Not a shock. At 4:30, she texts that she's home but has gotten involved in a conversation with her adult daughter, who lives with her. They can talk anytime they want, so I am annoyed. 5:00 rolls around and nothing. 5:05 I text her, \"Let's try this another time.\" She writes back, \"I can call now!\" But I'm pretty annoyed by that point - I feel bent that SHE picked this time and shows no urgency even though I've been waiting for her for over an hour. I'm in no mood to talk, and I text, \"Some other time, OK?\" And she texts back, \"OK, Sorry.\"   \n  \nMy mom often says, \"If you take a cat home, don't be surprised when they meow.\" It's my mom's way of saying we have to accommodate people's nature, even their flaws. And I have generally bent to my sister-in-law's habitual lateness. So, I am the a-hole for being mad this time? Or is it reasonable for me to set some boundaries? ",

Its why bullies get away with bullying while victims are demonized for standing up for themselves. \n\nWe should normalize respectful boundaries. Far to many people are like OP's mom and would rather deal with the ongoing annoying issue that address it mostly out of fear of drama. If you say 4pm, some grace can be given if you a late but if you are over an hour late, give me a break. That shows a complete lack of respect for the person you planned to talk to or go somewhere with. If it happens over and over again, someone needs to have a conversation with SIL and set a boundary. I get that people have lives but if you can't keep plans, don't make them. Its not fair to the people who maintain their lives and schedules as most people do.",

      "scenario_description": "I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. \n\nIn the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. \n\nI am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. \n\nThey’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. \n\nYesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. \n\nI had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. \n\nMy kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. \n\nBut afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. \n\nSo AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",

I got fed up and asked for more help and it led to that break up. \n\nYour husband should be stepping up. He should be corralling your kids to help out more. Kids can always help out more. No kid likes chores but at times, we have to support each other. You have been there for them. Now, they need to be there for you.\n\nYou were not to harsh.

      "scenario_description": "My family lost a dear friend and mentor/father figure of over 20 years to my husband. The services will be the same day as my brother’s 1st baby shower. Both of these events require travel. During the initial planning stages of the baby shower, my family was scheduled to help my mom prepare the food and decorations and obviously attend the celebration. I was always supposed to travel in a few days before everyone to help with preparations and spend time with my parents, brother and his wife as they also live out of state. When we got the news of the service times for our friend, I let my mom know that it was the same day as the shower and we wouldn’t be able to make it. My husband is giving the eulogy. But that I still wanted to come the week before and help her and spend time with them but would leave early so we could attend the funeral. She is mad at me. Told me not to come. That hardly no one was going to be at the baby shower and she’s hurt this was my choice. I spoke to my brother and told him of the situation he said I was making the right decision by going to the funeral. According to my mom, that was just lip service as “what was he supposed to say? The choice was already made.”. And they are all so hurt that we won’t be there. She won’t pick up the phone when I call and I got these details via a few short texts. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Background: My (31F) parents live overseas. They visit at least twice a year - one of those times being at Christmas.  While here, they stay with me an my husband (M31) and our 3 young kids. We love having them stay. \n\nToday however I got a call from my mum saying their friend ‘George’ (in his mid 20s I think) who is from their church (who they have known for a few years now says he thinks of them as second parents now) wants to visit Canada and stay at our house along with my parents for Christmas. My mum said they’d spoken about him visiting Canada in the past but she imagined this would happen when they had moved back here and had their own place - so always said she liked the idea. \n\nGeorge went to dinner at my parents house yesterday and brought up coming to Canada this Christmas, to stay with them at our house  and my mum didn’t have the heart to say no. She asked if this would be okay with us?\n\nMy husband and I have never met George and am due to have my 4 baby in a few months and it’s our year to host Christmas for our extended family - so Christmas is already going to be a bit hectic. \n\nI just don’t love the idea of someone I don’t know staying in our house and being around our family and tagging along and joining all our family traditions. Nothing specifically against George - I’m sure he is nice enough if my parents think so.\n\nSpace wise - we do have have a study that my husband uses to work from home. However my husband will still need to work some days before / after Christmas and I don’t know what kind of dates George is thinking of staying. \n\nI told my mum while I don’t really want George to stay here but if he gets his own accomodation - he can come for lunch at Christmas with the rest of the extended family. My mum was nice about it but I could tell she was a bit disappointed / sad and mentioned the trip would become a lot more expensive for him so he might not be able to do it. I can tell she felt awkward to have to tell him he can’t stay here.\n\nFor context my parents have always been people to open their home when others need it so I feel a bit bad saying no and now making my mum have to pass the message along. \n\nI think most people in my position would have said no but I do feel a bit bad so just wanting to know AITA here? Should I have thought about it more before giving an answer - I don’t think I’d change my mind though.",

      "scenario_description": "Sorry if this is disorganized english is not my first language.\n\nA bit of context, I (19m) am a college student pursuing a teaching degree, a part of my career includes some semesters in which I have to do actual teaching work at a school, school starts at 8am but to avoid traffic jam I'd wake up at 5 and leave at 5:30-5:40. My brother (23m) had recently gotten a job with similar starting hours as my practice and since we had to share half of the route anyway we decided that we'd leave the house together.\n\nSo queue the incident, one day I woke up half an hour late to what I'm used to, no big deal but he was already prepared, so I asked why he couldn't wake me up if he saw me oversleeping, he told me it wasn't his responsibility, and I answered that while that was true, I \"could not see any reason why he'd choose not to. We sleep on the same room, we wake up at the same hour, I'd understand if he had to go out of his way to shake me awake but that wasn't the case\" I wasn't angry, just confused but he responded very defensively, arguing that if I couldn't wake up on my own it was my problem, that I couldn't blame him for my own irresponsibility and that's he's not my alarm clock.\n\nThis stroked me as odd because I wasn't blaming him nor did I ask him to wake me as an obligation; waking eachother up when one of us overslept or had something to do early in the morning was just something that we had always done as part of sharing the room so I thought we were okay on that front.\n\nBy this point I was getting frustrated as the situation devolved into an argument, I told him that he was acting like saving me from oversleeping was something that he had to always; it had happened more than once, sure, but it was nowhere near as frequent or consistent as it'd have to be for him to justify acting like I was using him like a crutch. He denied this and told me that if I just \"slept earlier I'd not wake up late\" I've had problems with my sleeping for a couple years now as remnants of the pandemic, I don't sleep late but I wake up in the middle of the night, this is something that he knows. I told him that was unfair, he didn't hold this standard to anyone else on the family when they did oversleep, that he was taking a very corporate(?) approach to the entire situation and that if that was the hill he was going to die on I thought he was evil for choosing not to wake me up (plus, that if he tried to wake me up and I didn't, it'd no longer be his problem, but he didn't even try).\n\nWe would have continued to argue but the entire thing was aggressively shut down by my father who was overhearing the conversation and told me I was crazy; we brought it up again a couple days later where the same thing happened and recently my brother brought it up a third time as a part of a different argument to use as a claim that I always want to be right, but do I? I don't think I'm in the wrong but I don't want to be entitled. What do you guys think?",

Its common courtesy in families. Yes, you should wake up on your own but if this is a one time thing and he responds like that, he is the AH clearly. \n\nAt the same time, moving forward, you now know his thinking and rationale. If he is ever in a situation like this where you could help him, consciously choose not to and if he gets bent, laugh and tell him you are only giving him the energy that he gives you. \n\nLesson I learned in therapy is don't expect anything from people like your brother.

      "scenario_description": "Hello, 19f here and over the past few months I've restarted therapy through my university. It's every other week and completely free for students. I've liked the person they matched me with and it's been going well.\n\nI have a complicated relationship with my family and therapy. My parents put my sister and I in therapy when I was 14 in response to a traumatic event. My sister clicked with her therapist immediately but it took me five tries, as well as an unhelpful OCD diagnosis, to finally get diagnosed with PTSD and do EMDR that helped me. These five tries were all between the ages of 14-17.\n\nI have the feeling that my family judges me for not 'getting better' as quickly as my sister. There's a lot of \"It didn't work because you didn't try as hard as her,\" \"She's actually willing to put in the work,\" and \"Unlike her, you manipulate your therapists.\" I feel bitter about it because I told them early on that I wasn't ready to talk about what happened, they didn't listen when I said I didn't feel comfortable, and then they were surprised when it didn't work. They also said \"We put you in therapy so that you'll be upset there instead of with us.\"\n\nAt the end of every session, they would ask me what I talked about and then give me an agenda list of things to talk about the next week. Then, and this upset me the most, they would tell other people about it. Not just other family members, but randos like \"oh \\[my name\\] is in trauma therapy and they think she has PTSD but we'll see when she discusses this and that.\" The thing that happened was on the news against my family's wishes and then frequently brought up in the town council meetings and even in our schools, and I already hated feeling talked about, so having my parents share the treatment I was getting for it felt like more salt in the wound.\n\nWhen I went to college, I told my parents that I was very anxious and panicked a lot and it was interfering with my ability to function. They said \"We tried getting you help and you didn't want it so now you need to get it yourself. We're not helping you.\" I went and found my own therapist and didn't tell them. I didn't want them to tell every person I knew that I was feeling anxious/ask me what I discussed/look up the therapist and contact them themselves/tell me how I picked an incompetent person and would just fail again.\n\nRecently my sister and I had an argument and she told me it upset her that I wasn't in therapy, because she feels I don't value her enough to 'try to get better.' I told her that I have been in therapy for the past several months. She said that made her angrier because she felt like I was lying to her. Now my parents are angry too, they all say they feel lied to.\n\nI'm wondering if I'm TA? Initially I felt like I did nothing wrong, it's my own treatment and I'm facilitating it all myself. But my sister said \"My definition of true family includes being honest\" so now I'm worried I'm an awful sister who doesn't value her family enough.",

Deal with the issues with your therapist and keep those conversations private. No one else needs to be part of your therapy journey. My sister tried getting overly involved in my therapy process and always got mad at me when I didn't want to share with her. After trying to be respectful for a reasonable period and being up front that I wasn't going to be discussing those things, I eventually just made the decision not to discuss those issues with her anymore. Its none of her business unless I want it to be. \n\nPut yourself first. If you have to stay at school over a holiday to get a break, do it. Don't give in to their BS demands and expectations. Everyone deals with trauma differently. Took me nearly a decade to finally get my issues resolved because of difficulty finding a good therapist and having to change a few times.",

      "scenario_description": "I (27f) have been having ongoing issues with being excluded and not receiving invited to outings with my friends. For some backstory, we all used to be extremely close. Hung out every single weekend, and invited each other to everything we did. I also met a new friend from work that I invited to come hangout with all of us and now she’s invited to things, but not me. I also always planned airbnb trips every winter and summer and invited everyone, so I was never the one to exclude anyone from anything. To give them some credit, I was pretty flakly last year. There were a handful of times they would invite me out and I would say no/cancel the day of. But in my defense, it was mostly because I got diagnosed with endometriosis that year and had surgery. Which by the way they knew I was getting, and none of them checked on me to make sure I was okay. After I got better, I invited them to multiple events (a moutain house, a friendsgiving, and my ENGAGEMENT PARTY) that they all turned down. Now, I’m constantly seeing all of them hang out through instagram while never receiving invites. I decided that I didn’t want to see it anymore as it only upsets me. So, I decided to unfollow them. After I unfollowed them, my one friend reached out and told me it was petty to unfollow them and assume that they are purposefully not inviting me as they were all hanging out on a weekday and knew I had to work the next day. AITA? ",

I'd ask the friend why its ok for them to exclude you but its an issue when you back away? You can't have it both ways. Just gracefully continue separating yourself from that friend group. The fact they didn't check in at all when you had a medical problem is telling. The silent break up is telling. The reaction by the friend trying to make you the bad guy here is telling. These people have moved on and don't consider you a friend anymore. \n\nI would have done the same as you OP. I have this one friend. Close friend for 20 years. For quite awhile now, this friend is very busy by choice between work and hobbies. The problem comes in that every time I tried inviting him to a common hobby, he would always have a reason why he couldn't do it. He would still reach out but the invitation to hang out was always when it involved doing something he already had planned like working on his car so I'd have to help him if I wanted to hang or go rock climbing but he is training for specific climbs so wouldn't be able to hang out much so not really a good opportunity to hang out. I finally gave up and stopped inviting him places and now just wait for him to reach out. I still text him about stuff regularly but I decided to put myself first. If he wants to hang out with me and he has time, he will reach out. If not, we might go months without seeing each other. I accept that this is where our friendship is now.",

After diagnosis and related therapy, I've learned ways to help me not forget. It sounds redundant and crazy at times but I have reminders everywhere. \n\nFor birthdays and special occasions like friend's wedding anniversaries and the like, I have reminders in my phone and on my work calendar that are set to flash notify me the day of in the morning on one and evening in the other. For chores, I have a checklist on my fridge and focus on one chore per day most of the time. Heck, I even have to remind myself to communicate with people on a regular basis so I don't lose connection in those relationships. \n\nMy brain is out of sight out of mind and moves on very quickly. It was incredibly hard for me to start the new habits and routines that have and continue to help me today. I'd say it took 2-3 full years to get to a point where I could rely on myself completely.

      "scenario_description": "Hi Reddit, it's my first time posting and I'm sobbing as we speak while writing this. All though both my parents, Mom(F47) and Dad(M50) believe I have a misguided sense of anger and am projection my anger onto the boy who we'll call K.\n\nThis story starts at first when I, (F16), was 9, having just came home from school, my dad pulled me outside to have a chat (it is too be noted that me and my dad had and still do have a strained relationship bc of the way he acts and his inability to control his anger). It was then I was told I would have a younger sister R (F7) bc he impregnated his manager (Not my mom). At the time I was okay with it due to the fact all three of my older sibling are significantly older than me (M27, M22 and F21) and it would be my first time being an older sister. IT was HELL because her mom put my mom and me through hell all while being lovey-dovey with my dad. As well as my younger sister R has mental problems because of the hell she was put through and occasionally lashes out.\n\nNow back to current year, I am called by my dad and told I have a baby brother K (M1) and my dad wants to see him. I am HEAVILY against this because My life for the last 7 years has been centered around my little sister and her problems while I'm just here trying to adjust. I told my dad and mom \"I understand thats his son, but I only have 4 siblings, and he is and will not be my brother. Why is it okay for my mom to say she wont do anything for the baby but will for his first affair child?\" Why am I expected to be okay with someone who is another reminder my father doesn't give a shit about my mom or me. I was told that my anger was misguided but I don't think I am. AITA?",

      "comment_text": "NTA... the absolute worst thing your parents can do is force a relationship on you that you are not ready for or willing to partake in. \n\nYour half-siblings did nothing wrong. They didn't ask to be born to an affair. They don't exist to spite you. That said, their existence has caused expected problems. Your dad thinks you have to do whatever he says no matter how you feel about it. Your dad sounds like a truly awful human for his actions and treatment. \n\nYou need to put yourself first. At 16, that is hard but you don't have much longer before you can go out on your own. Seek out your school counselors to discuss these issues with. Sign up for after school activities or get a job if you can. They will keep you out of the house as much as possible. When you get home, you can focus on school work and separate yourself as much as possible. If you have a car or reliable transportation, use your school or local library to study. I used my local university library at times. When you turn 18, your options expand and you can decide when and where to move out. If you go to college, that will help because you can live on campus and get away from the toxic environment your father has created.\n\nPersonally, at 16-18, I would not have wanted a relationship with my father's affair children. they would be a constant reminder of how much of a crappy person my father was/is and how awful he has treated mom. Teenagers have a lot going on with growing up and school and life. Its not easy when you upend lives with BS crap like this. It creates mental health issues and the way they are trying to prevent you from protecting yourself from it is unhealthy. \n\nIf your parents aren't willing to help, just do what you can to avoid home life and isolate when you are home. Try and see if you can move in with a sibling that is living on their own. Otherwise, just foucs on improving yourself, minimize your availability and closeness to those you don't want to be around, and be patient for your options to expand.",
