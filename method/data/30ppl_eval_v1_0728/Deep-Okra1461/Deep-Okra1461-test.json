      "scenario_description": "AITA for refusing to help my sister with her baby every day after work?\n\nI (21F) work full-time, every day except Sundays. My sister (36F) recently had a baby, who is now five months old. I love my nephew and visit them whenever I can after work, but it’s usually a long trip and I get home around 9 p.m. when I go there.\n\nI live with my mom, and she doesn’t like me taking showers after 9 p.m. because of the noise. Even though I pay the water and electric bills, I try to avoid fights and respect that.\n\nMy sister just returned from maternity leave and asked me to come help with the baby every day after work so she can shower and get things done. I told her that it’s difficult for me because of how late I get home and the problems it causes at home. I also mentioned that I’m usually exhausted after work and that going there daily would be too much.\n\nShe said it was fine, but then got really upset and started yelling at me. She brought up personal things, saying I can’t keep a job and making me feel like I’m unreliable. I was just trying to explain my situation, but she seemed to take it as an attack.\n\nNow I don’t feel comfortable going to her house anymore, even though I care about her and the baby. She has a husband and in-laws who could help her too, so I don’t feel like it’s fair for her to expect this much from me.\n\nStill, I worry that my family will think I’m being selfish or uncaring.\nAITA?\n",

Since you have decided the answer is no, there is nothing more to discuss and that means there is no point in going over your reasons. If any family says anything then you tell them that they can go help your sister. Start standing up for yourself. Once people see that you won't take any s\\*\\*t they will stop trying to bother you.",

He has a Jeep that she bought him and he wanted to drive that to my house 190 miles away. His mom said he shouldn't drive it because it will break down and was recently out of the repair shop. I said I have AAA and can have it towed up to 200 miles and I would ride with him and my wife would follow us. Jeep made it fine. \n The next day we went for a ride and he was in an accident. No damage to the jeep but other persons car was damaged. We called the police and we can't find updated insurance and registration. We call his mom and find out she canceled the insurance and didn't renew the tags because it wasn't running. Now they are of course being sued by both the other parties insurance 9k for repairs and by the other driver for injuries etc. She claims I should pay for everything because he was in my care. I told her I am not paying a dime because she caused the problem by canceling the insurance and not telling anyone. I definitely would not have let him drive if I had known. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (26M) was at a crowded park recently where there were food trucks set up and people sitting around eating. Seating was pretty limited, and most people were sitting on this low concrete wall that runs along the edge of a parking lot. On the other side of the wall is a grassy area that's level with the top of the wall, so people sit with their backs toward the grass and legs facing the lot.\n\nI had just gotten my food when I noticed the only free spot left. At the same time, I saw a girl, well dressed for the park also walking toward it. She saw it first and was headed that way, but I was closer and got there before her despite her running when she saw me approaching it.\n\nAs I got to it, I looked down at the grass behind the wall and saw a big pile of dog poop right where someone’s lower back or clothes would land if they leaned or sat back. It was pretty gross, and I decided not to sit.\n\nRight then, she walked up and looked annoyed, saying, “Seriously? I was going to sit there.” I didn’t want to make a thing of it, so I just stepped aside and said, “Go ahead, you can have it.”\n\nShe immediately sat down without checking behind her and just a second later jumped up with a disgusted look on her face. The poop was stuck to the back of her skirt. She turned to me and snapped, “Why didn’t you say anything?”\n\nI told her, “I saw it, yeah, but I didn’t know how you were planning to sit. For all I knew you were just going to perch on the edge or sit upright. It’s a park — people walk their dogs here. You’ve got to check before sitting down.”\n\nShe kept insisting I should’ve warned her, but I told her I wasn’t trying to be petty, I genuinely didn’t know how far back she was going to lean or sit, and it wasn’t really my responsibility to check the ground for her. She could have sat only on the wall and not on the grass and would have been fine.\n\nShe eventually walked off frustrated, but now I’m wondering if I should’ve just said something anyway. But I feel like especially since she was so confrontational about the spot it wasn't really necessary.\n\nAITA?",

      "post_title": "AITA for Adjusting my In-Laws Thermostat while Dog Sitting?",
      "scenario_description": "Never thought I would be posting here, but I need some help on how much I should dig in here…\n\nMy in-laws, who live about a 30 minute drive away, left for a 3 week vacation and asked us to watch their 2 dogs (one of which is older and needs special diet/meds/attention). My wife and I have 3 dogs of our own and a smaller house and yard, so the wife and their parents decided on house sitting while they were gone and just relocating to the in-laws place as the better choice for all logistics.\n\nWe moved a ton of stuff over, my wife is 6 months pregnant and we have a 2-year-old, so staying for a few weeks involved more than just a small bag as you can imagine. I even decided to breakdown my home office and move equipment so I would be here for the remote work hours with the dogs. Been going well, lots of furries running round the yard, getting all the pets and treats they could want.\n\nThe conflict. They (father-in-law) has a smart thermostat for the HVAC/AirCon. It is set with a predetermined automatic schedule. During the day he has it programmed set at 77F/25C. We are a little warmer than preferred during the day, we have popped it down a few times to 74F/23C to take the edge off, but have left it alone.\n\nAt night, the program on the thermostat is set to 80F/26C!!! Thermometer in the bedrooms shows actual temperatures to be about 78F/25.5C.\n\nAfter laying down on the first night for a bit and both myself and my pregnant wife uncomfortable and having trouble falling asleep with it being warmer than how we sleep at our house, I did a manual adjustment down to 74F/23C. I continued and made a manual adjustment down to this temperature each night. I have adjusted it now for a week  down to this lower temperature just so my family could be more comfortable and get a better nights sleep.\n\nFather-in-Law texted this morning upset. Saying to leave it alone, he received an energy and usage report that there has been an increase in the last week, and that we can sleep in the basement at night (no bed in basement and 6-month pregnant wife).\n\nI responded that they should call us later today and we could discuss further, but the plan was to reimburse them the energy cost difference for while we were staying here. I didn’t tell him this, but I plugged in house size, current energy prices, and HVAC unit into ChatGPT to estimate energy cost difference and AI said maybe a $30 - $40 cost difference for the little lower temperature at night for the three weeks. I don’t know how accurate this estimate is, but I would gladly pay $100+ if it meant my wife could sleep in a bed at a reasonable temperature and have no more argument on the subject.\n\nJudge me Reddit, be brutal, any feedback to help me decide how much push-back to give. AITA for adjusting my father-in-laws thermostat?\n\nEdit for detail: The in-laws 3 week vacation is a river cruise in Europe, so trying to just handle most things rather than bug them with too many texts while they are abroad.\n\nEdit 2: Just heard back from them after I offered to pay. He said “it’s potential damage to the hvac system with multiple temperature changes daily.  Energy cost is secondary.”  Lowering the HVAC temperature once at bedtime to 74 degrees, does that really run a risk of damage? (US Central Air, Lennox Compressor from 2022)\n\nEdit 3: They ended up calling as I asked, though begrudgingly as he said he didn’t know what needed to be talked about when I kept asking we all talk. One of my texts in the back-and-forth was that the unnecessary conflict was stressing out the pregnant wife and that realigned them a bit. I was in the shower with the call timing sadly, but he is going to remotely reprogram it to schedule night temps down to 75. In hindsight, how in the world did this devolve into conflict!?! I appreciate all the genuine feedback and responses so I had an understanding how firm I need to be with the situation.",

That way we can figure out the difference between their average bill and the bill from when we were there. We can then reimburse them that amount. The one thing I would not allow is for him to think he can demand that we leave the system alone and just deal with the heat.",

Over the past six months, Kyah’s borrowed several things from me tools, a ladder, even my Wi-Fi password when her internet was down. I didn’t mind at first, but she’s terrible about returning stuff. My screwdriver set is still missing, she kept my ladder for weeks until I asked for it back, and she used my Wi-Fi for a month without offering to chip in for the bill. Each time, I’ve been polite and let it slide, thinking she’d get better about it. Last weekend, I ran into Kyah at the grocery store. She was at the checkout with a cart full of stuff but realized she’d forgotten her wallet. She asked if I could cover her $85 bill, promising to pay me back that evening. I hesitated because of her track record with my stuff and because I’m on a tight budget myself. I told her I could spot her $20 for essentials but couldn’t cover the whole bill, especially since it included things like expensive snacks and beer. She got frustrated, saying I was unneighborly and that she’d have done the same for me. She ended up leaving most of her items behind and only buying what she could with the cash she found in her pocket. Since then, Kyah’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and another neighbor said Kyah called me stingy. I feel bad because I know forgetting a wallet is stressful, and maybe I could’ve helped more since we’re neighbors. But I also feel like her pattern of borrowing without reciprocating made me wary. \n\nAITA for not covering her full grocery bill?",

Our mum has two small dogs, one of whom is unwell and needs to eat regularly, or she gets sick.\n\nFor context, I’m at university and also have a part-time job. My sister starts uni in a couple of months and works a temp job here and there. She’s very organised and she has a calendar on the fridge where we note down any plans. I had written that I’d be working from 10 AM to 6 PM on Saturday and 12 PM to 6 PM on Sunday and also noted that I’d be watching the football with friends on Sunday evening at the pub (I invited her and her boyfriend too).\n\nOn Saturday, she was out all day, and the dogs were alone—it happens sometimes and isn’t usually a huge deal. On Sunday, I walked the dogs before leaving for work. My sister and her boyfriend had already left to go to a local market. Around 2:30 PM, I texted her asking when she’d be home. She replied, saying she wasn’t going home at all.\n\nI reminded her I was working until 6 PM and heading straight to the pub after, so I wouldn’t be home to feed the dogs. She suddenly panicked, saying I never told her I wouldn’t be stopping at home first and that the dogs would be left alone and unfed for 12+ hours.\n\nI told her that my schedule was on the fridge, and it’s not reasonable to expect I’d go all the way home for 10 minutes just to turn around and head back into the city where the pub is—especially since I was already at work in the city. To me, it seemed obvious that I’d go straight from work. She said I was being rude and unhelpful and told me to figure something out.\n\nI told her there was nothing for me to figure out. She had no set plans that day and could’ve easily been home. She asked me to leave work, go home, sit with the dogs for 10 minutes, then head back out. I refused, and she claimed it was my fault for not explicitly telling her I wouldn't be coming home between work and the football. I told her to stop blaming me and to take responsibility, especially since she knew both my work and football plans.\n\nShe called me an asshole (along with a string of other things) and told me I had a bad attitude and that she wouldn’t be engaging with me any more. My mum is now involved and seems to be blaming me too.\n\nSo now, I have to miss the start of the football match with my friends and feed the dogs, and I’m really frustrated. I honestly don’t see how I’m at fault here—but my sister insists I am.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway also, English isn’t my first language, so sorry if anything sounds off. I just need an outside opinion.\n\nMy friend Beth recently turned 18 and had a birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant. There were about 15 or 20 of us. She is really close with two girls, Lia and Kat. They have been best friends for years and have this very intense, no-boundaries type of friendship. They go through each other’s phones, eat off each other’s plates, that kind of thing.\n\nI met them last year when uni started. I am not used to that. Even with friends I have known forever, I ask before I touch their stuff or try their food. \nThe trio teases me for this habit & they say I am too formal.\n\nAt dinner, Lia, told everyone to order whatever they wanted and that it was all covered. I asked if she was sure and she said, “Me saying it is the same as Beth saying it.” It felt a bit off, but I let it go.\n\nI just ordered a Coke and shared some of what was on the table. I asked Lia if I could get a beer and she gave me a weird look and said, “Idk” So I asked Beth, and she said I could but that her parents do not like alcohol, so I would need to pay for it myself. I said that was not a problem but still was getting dirty looks from Lia (maybe she wanted a beer too but didn’t want to pay idk) so ended up not ordering it to avoid more awkwardness.\n\nMeanwhile, Lia and Kat kept ordering a lot of sushi. I love sushi too, but for a group that size, it did not seem practical. I just ate whatever was already there.\n\nLater, I saw Beth sitting with my friend Millie and she looked really upset. Her mom had called and was angry because the bill was much higher than expected. Beth said Lia went overboard with the ordering and now she had to deal with it. I felt really bad said maybe next time she could plan a set menu or do the ordering herself. We stayed with her, comforted her, and tried to help her feel better. Lia was across the room laughing acting like nothing happened.\n\nThe bill got paid and we all left. Millie and I just gave each other that look like, “That was wild,” and moved on.\n\nA few days later, Lia sent me angry texts. She said Millie and I were stirring up drama and trying to come between her and Beth and ruined her rep infront of Beth’s parents. She also said that if we felt so bad for Beth, we should send her mom the money.\n\nI was honestly shocked. We did not say anything bad about Lia. We just tried to be kind when Beth was upset.\n\nI told her no. Respectfully, we are broke uni students & we were not the ones telling people to order freely.\n\nNow everything is awkward and tense and I hate it. I want to sort it out, but I do not think I should be blamed for all of it right? Sorry if this all sounds like petty high school drama.\n\nShould I have just paid to keep the peace?\n\nTL;DR: Friend’s birthday dinner got out of hand. I barely ordered anything, comforted her when she got upset, and now another friend says I caused drama and should help pay. I said no. AITA?",

My boyfriend’s always been uncomfortable with how clingy she is with me.\n\nWhen she finally showed back up, he told her she could ride with the guys she was with since she clearly wasn’t with us. She started crying, and he still told her she could ride back with us, but it’s not fair for her to disappear and treat us like a free ride. She chose to leave and turned her location off.

      "scenario_description": "My sister (31F) is staying with me temporarily after leaving her husband. I (30M) have a small apartment but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she’s six months pregnant. I wasn't very pleased about this situation but she is my sis afterall.\n\nThe main issue has been food. I’m pretty disciplined about what I eat because I am in bulk stage and hitting the gym regularly. I portion things, label them and plan for the entire week. But every other day something’s gone. Makes me crazy.\n\nShe’ll drink all my expensive shakes, polish off meals I’ve prepped for work, eat snacks I’ve saved for post run, and even finish leftovers I was planning to turn into new meals. When I bring it up, she shrugs and says things like “Cravings hit hard” or “Hormones” or \"You are being mean\".\n\nI asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. Or hell, manage her own food for god's sake. She refuses to do anything about it.\n\nSo last week I ordered a small mini fridge and set it up in my bedroom. It’s just big enough for my meal prep, snacks and drinks. I didn’t make a scene about it. I just quietly started putting all my stuff there.\n\nShe noticed two days later and got pissed. She said I was being “childish,” “dramatic” and “treating her like a thief.” I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights.\n\nNow she’s sulking and has told our parents after her failed marriage, her brother is also alienating her. And she is just a burden for everyone. My mom called and said I should “pregnancy isn’t easy” and especially for her situation.\n\nI don’t think I’m being cruel. I’m still letting her live here rent-free, and I’ve even offered to order food or cook together, but I just want my food to be left alone. A part of me understands she is going through trouble. But, at my expense?\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Obligatory: this is a throwaway, I’m on mobile, my formatting is probably shit, and I’m furious right now and also feeling a bit guilty so I apologize if this is a bit all over the place.  I’m gonna do my best. \n\nAdditionally, I was very wordy in my first post and accidentally went over 3k characters. (sorry mods 😭) I will provide additional context if requested.\n\n\nI (33F) go up to visit my brother (14m) about twice a year. He and I are really close, and I’m sad that he lives far away because he’s entering high school this year. I just went up for the weekend, and got back home last night. This trip, she found out that my husband and I bought a second vehicle so my husband and I didn’t have to share a single vehicle with conflicting work schedules (public transport isn’t reliable here).\n\nShe messages me as I’m getting ready to walk into work this morning and says that we need to have a conversation about “my student loans.” She can’t pay her $65/mo parent plus loan and that’s going to affect my brother.  I told her to apply for another forbearance, to call DepEd, to call a senator.  She immediately replied that she has been denied a forbearance extension, DepEd wouldn’t help her, and Senator couldn’t give any advice. (I’m not sure I believe she actually did any of these things.)\n\nI told her that the reason we have these things is that both adults in my household are working despite both of us being disabled (me with MS & my husband is a veteran), and then sent her a link to indeed. I then told her I had to go to work and to have a nice day.  She responded that she had to go to a food line to be able to feed my brother and to have a nice day.\n\nMy brother is old enough that he doesn’t need childcare. He can stay home alone if she and his dad are both at work. She would lose her Medicaid benefits and EBT if she got a job, but… if she got a job she wouldn’t need it?  Losing state-funded health insurance is the only con I can see to her getting her job, but with the recent news of Medicaid cuts, she might lose them anyway.\n\nSo… AITA for essentially telling her to get a fucking job???\n\nEdited to add: \n\nThis is quickly devolving into “JUST PAY THEM GOD YOU’RE SUCH AN AWFUL DAUGHTER. YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL.”  If I needed someone to tell me what an awful daughter I was, I would’ve just asked my mom.  I’m not grateful. I wish I would’ve taken out Sallie Mae loans instead of giving her yet another thing to hold over me and demand of me. \n\nMy question was if I was an asshole for telling her to get a job.  Because I did truly feel bad about it, and the way I went about telling her to get a job. \n\nI don’t care if I’m TA for not paying a loan she took out in her name to “save me” from Sallie Mae. That was her choice. I cared if I took it too far by implying “well if you’ve done all these things, I guess getting a job is your only other option.” ",

      "scenario_description": "Some context first: let’s call them “Team Priorities.”\n\nSince the beginning of our relationship, I learned my husband is the go-to person for family when it comes to money. Once we got serious and started a family of our own, we agreed to stop the handouts. We’re not wealthy by any means, but when we’re in a tight spot, we hustle and make it work without asking others for help.\n\nBut every now and then, “Team Priorities” sneaks back in and asks my husband to help cover a bill or some urgent expense. The frustrating part is the timing—shortly after asking for money, the fiancée is often posting about new outfits, day trips, or looking for tattoo artists. It’s hard not to feel taken advantage of.\n\nTheir latest visit really frustrated me. They said they wanted to come see us so the kids could spend time together (they’re close in age). We agreed and let them stay with us, thinking it was for quality family time. Wrong. They treated our house like a free Airbnb. We saw them one full day and briefly in the evenings—otherwise, they were off doing their own thing. Our daughter was really disappointed, which left me annoyed and honestly, a little sour.\n\nThen came the kicker.\n\nA week after they left, my husband got an alert that his credit score dropped 30 points. Turns out his cousin (the groom) missed a car payment. My husband co-signed that loan before we ever met. So they came to stay with us knowing they were in default—and didn’t say a word. Meanwhile, that missed payment affected our financial standing.\n\nI was livid. I wanted to message the fiancée and tell her to get their act together because it’s beyond disrespectful. My husband and I argued about it. He said I shouldn’t get involved and that the fiancée has nothing to do with the loan. But we’ve tried to get him removed from the loan and can’t—his cousin’s credit is too low. I even asked why the fiancée (soon to be wife!) couldn’t take over the loan, but my husband brushed it off, saying there’s only a year left.\n\nAfter sitting with it, I decided I’m not attending their wedding. My husband is still going—he’s the best man. But our daughter is starting kindergarten that same week, and I don’t want her missing those first days. Plus, she’s attending private school, so every penny counts, and I made it clear there will be no gift from us and he won’t be footing the entire bill for the bachelor trip either.\n\nIf it weren’t for the kids, I’d have stepped back from this relationship a long time ago. The fiancée gives off strong narcissistic/toxic vibes—but that’s another post.\n\nSo, AITA for skipping the wedding and refuse to gift them anything?",

      "scenario_description": "I (24M) have an identical twin. We're not close, but I thought we had basic mutual respect. That belief was tested.\n\nI grew up in a traditional Southern town & only began coming out in college, about five years ago. It's been slow, especially with family. But since moving to DC in '23 for school/work, I've felt more comfortable living authentically.\n\nAfter moving, I met my boyfriend (26M), & we've been together 2yrs. Over time, I've introduced him to friends and family when I felt safe.\n\nCut to Nov. '24: I was home for the holidays & told my twin & his fianceé about my bf. They seemed happy for me. While staying with them, wedding details arose, & they asked if I'd be bringing a date. I said yes, my bf. My twin had gone to bed, but his fianceé said, \"While there are pros and cons, it's up to you if you want to bring him.\" That felt like a green light. My twin constantly deferred to her on decisions, so I didn't think I needed to double-check.\n\n5 months passed, my bf & I had spent $1,300 on travel (flights, hotel, etc.). 3 weeks before the wedding, I mentioned on a call with my brother that we were all set. His tone shifted: \"Oh, is BF actually coming?\"\n\nI reminded him of the convo with his fianceé. He said she never gave me permission & accused me of making it up. Then said, \"We can't allow your bf to come. We worry how Dad's side will react.\"\n\nI offered to call Dad on the spot. He dodged, saying he'd check with his fianceé (despite just saying it was his decision.) An hour later, no change. I was still invited-ALONE, still expected to buy a groomsman-match suiting (even though I wasn't in the party), & show up smiling.\n\nThat's when I snapped. I asked, \"If I didn't invite your fianceé to my wedding, would you still come?\" He couldn't answer & ended the call after some harsh words. \n\nTrying to make things right, I came out to my dad (which I feared for years) to explain the situation. He was surprisingly indifferent & even said uninviting my bf was extreme. He offered to talk to extended family. I thought I was removing the main obstacle. \n\nWeeks later, my twin called again. He now claimed our friends would be \"weirded out\" (So the excuse shifted) I said, \"If my bf's not invited, I'm not coming.\" He didn't budge.\n\nHere's the kicker: days later, my dad told me the fianceé admitted she did give me permission but changed her mind when she remembered \"who would be there.\" She denied this to my twin. Also, one of her bridesmaids is openly gay and brought her gf, but, according to the fianceé, \"she's not part of the family,\" so it's different.\n\nSo I didn't go. I'm still wondering if I made the wrong call. My absence was noticed. I got texts asking where I was. My mom had to explain it repeatedly. So instead of avoiding attention, my absence became the story. My relationship with my twin is dead, & some family ties now feel fragile.\n\nPart of me wonders, should I have sucked it up & gone solo, just to preserve bonds that shaped my early life?\n\nSo, AITA for skipping the wedding?",

If you are true to yourself, suddenly those fake bonds are gone. I think you did gain ground with your dad. He didn't turn on you and actually seemed supportive. A lot of parents go out of their way to make sure that everything goes the way the wedding couple wants. Your dad didn't do that, he thought about what was right.",
