      "scenario_description": "I (29F) have a sibling that is 10 years older than me. We will call him Bob (39m). Bob and I have always had a strained relationship as he was always babied and favored by our mother. And there was alot of trauma he caused in my childhood for no reason at all. Few months back my mom tells me Bob is having a baby with his new gf of maybe 6 months to a year. \nMy response  was not what she apparently expected. \nI said “okay is he aware he cant just walk away from the kid when he decides he doesnt wanna be responsible anymore?” \nShe told me “its still a baby and we needed to get along for its sake”\nI responded “I don’t know that child, that child’s life wont be any different without me in it. Just like my children’s lives haven’t been any different without him in theirs” \nShe didnt like that. My dad has told me its not the babys fault my brother is an idiot. I agree but still im not changing my boundary. \n\nFor further explanation, ive had to carry the responsibilities in our family my entire life. Ive had to care for our mother on my own for years, ive always been the one our dad relies on. He(Bob) bullied me relentlessly growing up and is still a raging alcoholic. I have no desire to have that in my life or my kids life. \n\nBob knows why we dont have discussions. He was notified as to why we dont talk. \n\nIts caused my relationship with my mom to become once again strained because she thinks i need to “let things go”. \n\n\nEdit: im against him having a child because he walked out on two other children he helped raise from ages 6months & 3 years old. He told them repeatedly no matter what he would always be there because their bio dad wasnt around from birth. After 10 years he up and decided no more and went no contact for a girl he was cheating with. Kicked them out if his house to move his gf in. \n\nSo i refuse to give him the time of a day and acknowledge him as a “parent” after that. \n\n\nSECOND EDIT: \nMy mom has prev tried to force a relationship between my youngest and Bob. By trying to get her to speak to him, go to him, ect. \nWhere i always advocate that she doesnt know him and to stop or we will leave. \nShe doesnt mention it anymore but has started acting like she requires an invite to come see her grandkids. Like im just too busy or something for her to come over. When that has never been the case. \n So AITA here?\n",

      "post_title": "AITA for refusing to do the dishes after knee surgery even though my mom says I'm just being lazy?",
      "scenario_description": "I (23F) had major knee reconstruction surgery about 3.5 weeks ago. It’s been a rough recovery—I’m 50%-weight-bearing, using crutches, and following a 9-month rehab plan. I live at home while finishing grad school and, in exchange for no rent, I help out with groceries and chores.\n\nBefore surgery, I told my parents I wouldn’t be able to do much physically for a while. I even suggested we use paper plates to make dishes easier, and my mom was on board. They helped for a few days after surgery… then left for nearly two weeks to visit family (a trip they booked after knowing my surgery date). During that time, my brother, SIL, and their kids came to stay and were seriously amazing. They helped with meals, dishes, and errands, and I helped by watching the kids when needed. It was a good balance.\n\nWhen my parents got home, it took about three days before my mom expected me to go back to full chores—especially dishes. I told her I wasn’t comfortable doing them yet and said I’d double-check with my physical therapist. When I asked him, he looked horrified and said no way—it’s still too early and would risk injury. He even gave me a written note explaining it.\n\nWhen I told my mom, she got angry and called me a “lying weasel.” I offered a compromise: if she or someone else emptied the dishwasher, I’d fill it—since I can do that while leaning on my crutches. She refused, saying it was my turn and my problem. She let the sink pile up in 80º heat for over a week just to prove a point.\n\nI was honestly torn—do I break doctor’s orders, risk re-injury, or ask my SIL (who already did so much) for help again? Ultimately, I didn’t want to sacrifice my health just to avoid conflict.\n\nThen I found out my mom’s acting this way because last summer she was in a boot for a foot fracture and claims I didn’t help her with dishes. I don’t remember her asking, and she wasn’t on crutches or under strict medical restrictions like I am.\n\nToday my dad yelled at me too. I explained everything, and he agreed to empty the dishwasher if I filled it. It got done in 30 minutes. I told my mom the same deal still stood—and she snapped, saying I had no right to “remind her” and implied I’ve been avoiding my responsibilities.\n\nNow they’re both treating me like I’m being lazy and manipulative, but I don’t see how that’s fair. I planned ahead, offered realistic compromises, and followed medical advice. I’m not even allowed to drive yet.\n\nSo, AITA for not doing the dishes after surgery—even if it’s “my turn”?\n\n\nEdit to add:\n\nI just wanted to add a bit more context about the situation with my mom and the boot last summer. It’s not that we ignored her or left her to struggle—actually, we helped a lot. My dad and I spent the entire summer running errands, helping around the house, and making sure she was supported while she healed. She wasn’t neglected at all.\n\nThat said, the dishes specifically have always been a bit of a point of tension between us. My mom has strong opinions about how and when they should be done, and unfortunately, that’s been a recurring issue for years. So I’ll admit—I probably didn’t jump to take that particular task off her plate if she was still capable and willing to do it. At the time, I was working full-time, in school full-time, and already doing my share around the house. I didn’t need one more thing unless it was absolutely necessary.\n\nI’ll also own that last summer was emotionally rough for me. My grandma had just passed away, and I was struggling with undiagnosed depression. I was only just starting to get the help I needed, so maybe I missed some areas where I could have shown up more. I’m not perfect—but I did try my best.",

Here's the deal: If I have to ask you for your help, you get no extra credit for offering to help me. If you offer to help me, now I'm grateful for the help itself AND I'm also going to remember that you were thoughtful enough to offer help in the first place. This will pay off for you if you ever need my help in the future. In your case, earning good will from your mom by offering her help back then would be paying off right now. But you didn't offer the help so your mom is reminding you of that. It's like that part in Willy Wonka where he tells the guy \"So you lose. You get nothing! Good day sir!\"",

      "post_title": "AITA for Asking My Parents to Pay Me Back?",
      "scenario_description": "I (19F) was asked by my parents two years ago to give them a total of $4000. The reason they had asked me was because my mother had recently lost her job at the same time that we had just moved to a pricier house, so it was really bad timing. Just to preface, I was not the only one they asked to borrow money from, they asked for help from my older brothers (22M and 31M) as well. However, because my 22 year old brother didn’t have a job and my 31 year old brother was already moved out and paying his own bills they only borrowed a $1000 from each of them. \n\nWhen they asked me for money I didn’t hesitate at all to say yes because my parents have been really supportive and caring of me and my siblings, and so I wanted to do my best to help them during these tough times. Fast forward to nearly two years later, my mother has found a new job and our financial situation is much more stable. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes: My parents promised they would pay me back as soon as my mother found another job. And they did, they immediately paid $1000 to me and my siblings. So they fully paid off my brothers, while still owing me $3000. In any other situation this would be fine with me, because I understand that they still have expenses and debts to pay. I’m not currently using that money as I am still living with them and am taking out loans for my studies. However, while they still do owe me money, they’ve also started to add a bunch of features and upgrades to the new house. They’ve done things like put grass in our yard, built a patio and shed in the backyard, among other things. And I know for a fact that the cost of these things far surpasses the money they owe me. \n\nBecause of this, I have started to feel anxious because I still haven’t gotten my money back. The money they borrowed was about half of my total money from my first ever part-time job. And now that I am older I have plans to move out and I want to invest that money they owe me.\n\nOne day they told me they had plans to expand our drive way. This was kinda my breaking point and it lead me to bring up the money they owe me, because this was yet another upgrade they didn’t need and would cost a fortune. But when I asked, my parents suddenly got very defensive, and they said that I shouldn’t be acting selfish like this and allowing money to get in the way of family. They also said that because of them, I don’t have to pay rent while I’m studying and working, so this was the least I can do. \n\nI love my parents and they insisted that they’ll pay me back when they can, but I can’t help but feel weird when I see them spending all this money and still not keeping or acknowledging their promise of paying me back sooner. But I’m also starting to have doubts after my conversation with them because it did make me feel like I’m a selfish person who only cares about money. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My mum (56) has been dating a man (“Adam”) for 5 years. I’m 28F. They met online during COVID and said “I love you” within 3 weeks—before they’d even met in person. At the time, we had just gotten out of a 20+ year abusive home situation (our mum didn’t protect us—we got us all out), We’d encouraged her to date to stop her going back to dad, but the intensity of the relationship raised red flags.\n\nAdam is in his late 50s, never married, supposedly has a good job but nothing to show for it. I suspect he gambles, he watches every sport, every team, obsessively. He lives in England; we’re in Ireland.\n\nThere have always been red flags—subtle digs about my mum aging, calling her decisions “our” decisions but keeping his private. He makes no effort with family and isolates her. I think he’s using her and possibly planning to freeload off her divorce settlement.\n\nThe final straw was him watching football on his phone for 15+ minutes at my grandad’s funeral. I waited a few weeks to tell my mum. When I did, he denied it—she believed him over me.\n\nThings got tense. My sister 22F and I ended up in family therapy (without him) and agreed to one last conversation with Adam. We told our mum: if it went badly, she could keep seeing him, but she had to stop trying to involve us. It was a big deal—we were anxious and triggered by having to confront a man about his behaviour, given our past.\n\nThe conversation was awful. He said, “We’ll agree to disagree,” then admitted he “glanced” at his phone, then finally admitted to watching the match. Still—no apology.\n\nSince then (6 months ago), we’ve had no contact with him. I’ve told him I don’t want to speak to him again. Now my mum is saying we need to “fix things” and come for dinner to “sort it out.” She gets upset when we say no.\n\nI’m exhausted. I can’t control who she dates—but I won’t be around him. It’s stressful, triggering, and upsetting. Some people say we’re being “overly sensitive” due to cPTSD. But honestly, we’re too tolerant—we survived years of abuse. If we were fragile, we would’ve broken. We didn’t.\n\nNow I’m getting married next year. And I’m already heartbroken because my dad won’t walk me down the aisle—not because he’s gone, but because of what he did to us. That’s something I’ve had to grieve. But now it feels like another man in my mum’s life is going to ruin another major moment. My graduation, birthdays—those were all made miserable by my dad. And now it feels like my wedding could be overshadowed by another man she’s putting first. I just don’t understand how it’s unreasonable to want my wedding day to be about me—for once—not about managing someone else’s boyfriend.\n\nMy mum clearly thinks I’m the problem—that I’m being difficult and dramatic because of our past. And honestly, I’m starting to feel like I am the asshole. But deep down, I don’t think I am. I just feel like one for standing my ground.\n\nAITA for drawing this boundary and saying I don’t want to spend Christmas or my wedding with this man?\n\nEdit: my mum will definitely come to my wedding, we are actually really close and get on so well (apart from this drama) which is why it’s even more hurtful. When it’s not about men we have a really good relationship. It does feel more like a sister relationship - she’s honestly not a bad person, she is a great mum in lots of ways, she just makes really bad decisions with men that make it look that way. \n\nMy little sister has supported me and been there for me through everything - she’s who will walk me down the aisle we’ve been through everything together it’s only right ❤️ \n\nFurther edit: \nI have said to her about going No contact if she continues to force him on us and she feels this is me forcing her to break up with him and not letting her make her own decisions.

(we all like to get together for the fourth of July) when the party died down i was with my fiancé, sister and another close friend from home in my parents basement.  my sister sat in between me and my fiancé which i   didn’t mind because they are very close friends, however she made a joke saying “ what if i made out with your fiancé right now!” i was shocked but didn’t want to speak up right then and cause a fight in front of our freind. so i just said “oh. that would be so crazy… please don’t”. later i approached my sister about it and asked why she would say that and its a bit weird to talk about kissing my fiancé. she said that i was overreacting and it was all jokes going on about how i need to understand that’s just how she jokes with him. i understand that they have been friends for a long time but it made me very uncomfortable when she made that ‘joke’. i talked to my fiancé and he said that he also thought it was weird of her to say that.  but now i am fighting with my sister about this almost every day. \n\nam i the asshole for starting a fight with her about it?",

From now on I will consider anything like that to be a deliberate insult\". Then if she does it again you take whatever action you would take when someone is deliberately attacking you. There is no need to argue anything. My guess is that she is trying to show you that she has higher status than you. She 'jokes' like that right in front of you. If you do nothing, she proves she has the higher status. That's why you have to put a complete stop to it. Don't let your fiance stay out of it. He should be standing with you on this. If he's marrying you then their friendship automatically gets bumped down to a second tier relationship. If he's trying to keep her on the same tier as you, he's showing you who he really cares about.",

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

Amy says that Josh spends too much on drinking and betting on horse races, while he accuses her of buying many brand name accessories and only using them a few times each. Frequent arguments that have only gotten worse.\n\nYesterday I visited and found them in the middle of one. A shouting match, with insults like ‘degenerate gambler’ and ‘superficial bitch.’ So I said to them ‘You want me to take Tim to Henry’s restaurant?’ Amy said ‘Yes, please’ and Josh just nodded.\n\nWhen we got there and Tim got his dinner, I talked to Henry. We were standing away not too far away from the table, whispering. Henry told me Tim is old enough to understand what is going on with his parents and that adults can be mean to each other. He also said shielding children from the truth ends up hurting more than helping.",

      "scenario_description": "I live in a state that gets cold winters and hot, humid summers. I have never been lucky enough to live somewhere with central AC and my current house is no different. It gets very very hot. The only rooms with air conditioning are the bedrooms, one is for sleeping and the other is an office. We have lived here for 4 years now. \n\nEvery summer I have the same problem, it gets too hot for me to cook. Right now, my kitchen is 85°f (~29.5c) In the past summers, it gets up to 90°f (32c). It is so hot that when I cook, even quick meals like spaghetti, I overheat. I get dizzy, my head hurts, I feel weak. It is awful. My husband knows about this. \n\nI finally got fed up. After another episode of overheating while cooking, I broke down and ordered an air conditioner for the kitchen. It’s small and cheap, about $200 and it will keep the kitchen cool. My plan is to use it when I am cooking or cleaning in the kitchen. \n\nMy husband wasn’t home when I ordered it and I honestly forgot to tell him I ordered it until it arrived 2 days later. He saw me bring it inside and asked what it was and I told him it was an air conditioner for the kitchen. \n\nHe is mad that I didn’t consult him before buying it. That is true, I didn’t. And I forgot to tell him I did. He told me it was a waste of money, too expensive to run, and I can just use a fan when I cook or just not cook at all. He wanted me to return it. \n\nI don’t want to go the whole summer never being able to cook because the kitchen won’t cool off. I also paid for it with my own money, I don’t expect him to split the cost with me, and I pay the electric bill! I can afford the added cost of running it a few times per week to cool down the kitchen so I can cook without getting sick. \n\nI didn’t return it like he wanted and I installed the air conditioner myself and have used it twice since I got it, once to cook and once to do a deep clean in the kitchen. When it’s been on, he scoffs and rolls his eyes and acts all passive aggressive because he thinks it was a waste of money and frivolous spending. \n\nSo AITA for buying an air conditioner without consulting my husband?",

      "post_title": "AITA for not going to my In Laws house seven days after surgery?",
      "scenario_description": "So starting this of I (21F) have Pcos and was getting a laprascopy to check for endometriosis as it runs in my family. Luckily I didn't have it but still have the stitches and everything healing. So I got the surgery last Monday and first and second day was at my In Laws house as I have a bad habit of getting up and cleaning when I can't or shouldn't. The problem is while I was there I was given no help almost at all and expected to get up every hour to walk laps around the main area of the house twice. Not including getting up to go to the bathroom or getting myself food. I also wasn't allowed to stay in the guest bedroom past 9am I had to be on the couch. So while I was there my MIL was caring for my niece in the other room who is a year and a half but just left me to my own devices on caring for myself. Which I got jumped on by both the cat and their little dog who is about ten pounds. So by day two I just said I wanted to go home. Over the next few days I was getting better but day five I leaned down to pick up some of my husband's clothes cause I almost tripped over them. Causing me to later find my stitches having dried blood around them which is in my belly button so it wasn't hard to tell. They still have been bleeding but I'm not catching when but it really hurts to move too much and so I spent today laying down. Most days I get up amd pace cause it's my routine. The problem was today I was supposed to go to church but I didn't cause I wasn't able to sleep and the stitches kept hurting extremely bad. Later in the day after my husband got home my MIL texted this:\n\nMIL: Hey how are you doing?\n\nME:Still hurting but mostly just extremely tired. One of my stitches had dried blood so I didn't wanna accidentally open them or anything\n\nMIL:At this point, it shouldn't matter. Your insides should be practically healed. I've had similar procedures in the past and was up and doing everything that I needed to be doing within a day or two. It shouldn't be taking you this long to heal. Is it red, extremely hot around it or does it have puss coming out of it? \n\nME:No pus just and not hot just slightly bleeding for some reason\n\nMIL:It does not help to just lay around. You have to get up and get moving. I know you can do this. You are stronger than you know. When you feel weak, ask God to give you the strength and energy that you need in order to be the person that He created you to be. \n\nEND \n\nSo after my husband said that she was just worried that I'm not healing and that she is right and I need to get up and move but now I'm upset about it and have to go to work tomorrow as my first day back. I work at a gym but am not allowed by my doctor to pick up anything heavier than a jug of milk. I won't get my stitches out till a week from Tuesday so I need to be careful not to rip them. \n\nSo am I the asshole for getting upset and just not going cause I was hurting or is she right?\n\nUPDATE: So I returned to work today and had to go home after 3 hours as it felt like something was really hurting, and when I took the bandage off, there was more fresh dried blood. I called my surgeon's doctor's office, and they are scheduling a soon as possible complications follow up. As for my husband, he is 27, and before we married , he lived away from his parents to go to college. He and I have been married two years in August. To him, cleaning is a hassle he doesn't usually do since all of his off days he is usually doing yard work for his grandparents or parents. He works 9 hour shifts at a car dealership selling parts, but his drive got longer due to us moving, so it's an hour there and an hour back. I usually try to keep up with cleaning but have severe depression issues and drops that last for months at a time, so it gets dirty often. As for the reason for the surgery and why they did it is because I was having extreme abdominal pain on an almost daily basis and which was making me miserable and having difficulty finding a job and then working. My mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and great great aunt all had endo, and my mom had ovarian and endo cancer that spread up to her diaphragm. I also had been put on birth control that I didn't want as I really want kids and in my family die to complications you usually can't after 25 or it is incredibly difficult to the point of my cousin almost died giving birth to her son three months ago and she is 30. The reason for the birth control, as you can guess MIL. As my SIL just had my neice and they said not to have a baby till she was at least three. Which mostly translates to I need to be healthy beforehand, which I get. When I got married, I was 110 at 5'5 and had undiagnosed pcos, which I was having bi monthly cyst ruptures. They convinced me to take the birth control to help with the cyst. Which led to me getting ocular migraines and worst ruptures. I stopped the birth control almost four months ago and still no period even when they gave me the progesterone pills to try making me have one before surgery, which I just spotted for a day. I am now 127 pounds and am trying to get to at least 140 and hold it for at least four months, then start trying. My husband, yes, is a mama's boy but has gotten me out of my own shitty family, and we are trying to work on boundaries with his parents, but he is a little thick headed.\nDOCTOR UPDATE: saw a doctor who said I was fine as no fever or pus. Didn't check the internal stitches and my blood pressure was 100/50. At the moment I'm extremely tired and my mother is working hard to get a doctor who will check the internal stitches. I have stopped telling my MIL anything and my husband is worried but trying to get MIL involved ",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nSo I (34 f) have a little sister (28 f) that needed somewhere to go to get her and her 3 small kids away from her abusive boyfriend. My wife and I had just moved across the country, back to my hometown, to be closer to the family literally about two weeks prior to us giving her somewhere safe to stay. Shortly after that she made up a story about taking the kids camping with her two best friends. Later, we find out (from the kids) that they were actually with said ex boyfriend. I sat her down and explained to her that I knew the truth and that I knew she lied to me. She altered the story slightly to include him saying he “just showed up” yet none of the other friends were even there😐\n\nFast forward to this weekend and my wife and I are out of town. Sister is at the housing watching the dogs so she reaches out and says her and her best friend are taking a trip to Colorado. Cool. I tell her to have so much fun. We converse a bit about Colorado over the weekend and then I went to text her again and her location popped up (she had said a few days before that she was setting up Siri and it must have messed up her location settings when I asked why her location was off). Her location said she was in Arkansas (which she used to take a lot of trips to when she was dating the ex boyfriend) so I straight up ask her “hey why are you in Arkansas?” And she replies saying they changed the plan due to money and I said “Is that true? Cause I know you went to AR with *ex boyfriend” all the time and really hope you’re not lying to me again”. She went on to assure me she was telling the truth even adding in more detail about her friend and what they did.\n\nThat was yesterday. I got an unrelated call today from one of my best friends. We talked about things in our lives going on since I’d been out of state and then she asks if my sister was dating that guy again. I ask her why she’d ask and she says because they just went on a trip together and she saw it on facebook. He posted multiple pictures and even named the exact place my sister had claimed to be with her friend. \n\nI set a boundary, after the first lie, that if she wanted to live with us then she couldn’t also be with him. Now, if she wants to go date that loser then it’s her life and she absolutely can…just not while living with us. Also, that she can’t lie to me. We are trusting her with our home, our pets, and everything that comes with it. It’s supposed to be our safe space and this guy is OFF THE RAILS with alcohol, drugs, and violence. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to kick her out for lying to me and hanging out with him?",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nTl;dr: A mostly nice person has twice told me that my parents don't love me. I could have an adult conversation with her about this, but I'd rather wait to see if she says it again, and be a little hyperbolic and try to make her feel guilty.\n\nMy wife’s aunt Sally has twice told me that my parents don’t love me. I don’t think she meant to be hurtful, but I really hated hearing that. \n\nThe first time, she was upset with me, and lecturing me about how to be a better husband. She presented it as a way to make allowances for me and relate to me. It was basically, “I know what it’s like to grow up with parents who don’t give you unconditional love, but you’re an adult now, and you need to decide what type of person you’re going to be.”\n\nThe second time, she meant it as a compliment. A few months before my son was born, she said “I know you’re going to be a loving father, even though you didn’t get the love you needed growing up.” \n\nI have a complicated relationship with my father. He can be very obnoxious. Things have been tense between us for the past two years. It’s a very sensitive topic for me. I have difficulty talking about it even with close friends. If you were trying to hurt my feelings, it would be hard to find a better vulnerability to poke. \n\nI'm not good at thinking on my feet. I didn't know how to respond the first two times. If she says it again, I want to say “I know you're trying to be nice, but that's one of the most hurtful things anyone has ever said to me.”\n\nI realize that there’s a right way and a wrong way to address this, and my way is definitely somewhere in the middle. I'm just trying to find out which side of the asshole line it falls on. A well-adjusted adult would either have a heart-to-heart with Sally, about the lingering feelings from what she said, or just let it go and accept that she made a mistake. On the other end of the spectrum, some people would address this with yelling and name-calling.\n\nSally and I got along very well for several years before this happened. Now, I'm uneasy about sharing anything personal with her. I make chitchat with her, but I don't like to get into deep conversations, because I don't like the idea of her knowing about sensitive topics.\n\nI want her to feel ashamed of herself. I'm certainly being at least a little bit of an asshole by weaponizing her compassion against her. I just want to know if I'm going too far.\n",

      "post_title": "AITA for throwing out my friend’s couch after it sat in my garage for 3.5 years, even though I said she could only store it for two weeks?",
      "scenario_description": "In 2019, a friend asked if she could store a couch in my garage. It had belonged to her late father, and they were clearing out his house.\n\nI said no.\n\nMy garage is small. One car and barely any extra room. It isn’t insulated, it leaks, and squirrels basically have squatter rights. I don’t store anything there on purpose. I also told her that people always say they’ll “pick it up soon,” and then never do. Somehow the person doing the favor becomes the villain.\n\nShe kept pushing. I offered options:  \n– Rent a storage unit  \n– Get a U-Haul, take the couch home, and have her kids drive up and get her car  \n– Leave it at her dad’s and take the risk\n\nHer niece even borrowed a trailer to bring it to me. All that, just to keep it out of her siblings’ hands.\n\nI finally said yes, but I was crystal clear. Two weeks. After that, I could do whatever I wanted with it.  \nShe said absolutely. Her kids would be there that weekend to pick it up.\n\nThey never came.\n\nI called a few times that first year.  \n“Oh yeah, we’ll come get it.”  \nCrickets.  \nIn one of my “please get your couch” calls, she said, “I’m a Sagittarius. We’re not good at this stuff.”  \nI’m still not sure what that has to do with picking up your couch.\n\nI tried again in year two. Same story. After that, I gave up. She never once brought it up on her own.\n\nAround year three and a half, I had construction work happening. The crew backed a trailer into the garage and accidentally crushed the couch. When we looked closer, it was already moldy and torn apart by squirrels. The workers felt bad. I told them not to worry. It had been sitting there for years.\n\nWe even discussed whether I should tell her. Everyone agreed there wasn’t much point. She hadn’t mentioned it in over three years.\n\nSo I didn’t.\n\nFast forward to this year — now year six. I mention I’m cleaning out the garage and she casually says, “Oh, I need to come get that couch.”\n\nMe: “It’s gone. The squirrels got it.”  \nHer: “What?”  \nMe: “Yeah. The garage isn’t insulated. They love it in there.”  \nHer: “I had no idea.”  \nMe: “You did. You just forgot. And I said two weeks.”\n\nShe hasn’t spoken to me since. Unfriended. Full stop.\n\nMeanwhile, I lived around that couch. I broke my toe on it. I had to work around it constantly. I paid to have it hauled away. It took up space I didn’t have for three and a half years. The first time she brought it up was in year six.\n\nSo I’m really asking:  \nShould I have told her back when it got ruined, even though she hadn’t asked about it in years?  \nAt year six, should I have just said “sure, come get it” and played along, even though I doubt she would have?  \nOr was this always going to end the same way, no matter what I did?\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nFriend asked to store her dad’s couch “for two weeks.” I said no, then agreed with a firm limit. She left it for 3.5 years. Couch was destroyed. I tossed it and didn’t tell her. She finally mentioned it in year six. Now she’s upset. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "So here’s what happened. My friends, John and Jane, and I were supposed to meet in my town for a festival, but it got rained out. I offered to drive toward them instead (about an hour for me) so we could still hang out and get dinner. Everyone agreed, and we met at a restaurant John picked—not a bar, just a dinner spot—but it was super crowded and loud. None of us could really hear each other talking.\n\nWe had a great meal and finished up. While we were boxing up our leftovers, John (kindly) paid for dinner. Then he and Jane ordered another beer. I don’t drink, so I was just sitting there. About 45 minutes passed with them slowly sipping their beers—John was mostly on his phone—and I finally said, “Okay, you guys gotta chug those, let’s go for a walk or something.”\n\nTen more minutes passed and they still weren’t even halfway through. I finally said, “Alright, we’re leaving—you can leave the beers.” John walked downstairs to finish his at the bar, and Jane said, “Well, he paid for it—he wants to finish it.” I responded, “It’s been almost an hour. It’s loud, hot, and you’ve both been on your phones.”\n\nI left feeling like they were annoyed with me, but honestly, I was frustrated. They both know I don’t drink and that I have sensory issues—it’s hard for me to sit in chaotic environments like that, especially doing nothing and being ignored. When I first asked them to finish their beers, I suggested we walk around downtown so we could actually do something and still hang out, but they didn’t seem interested. I had driven an hour to meet them and tried to be flexible after our original plan got rained out, but it felt like they weren’t meeting me halfway.\n\nThis isn’t a one-time thing either. They regularly invite me to stay the night—even though they know I have two dogs and two cats at home, and I always tell them I can’t leave my animals overnight. Even on the Fourth of July, after I explained that I stay home because fireworks are hard on my pets, they kept asking me to come out again. It’s like my answers or boundaries aren’t enough, and they just ignore or push past them.\n\nAnother layer: whenever plans change—especially if I’m the one suggesting something different—John always makes little digs or sarcastic comments about how he doesn’t enjoy the new plan as much. It’s subtle, but it adds up and makes me feel like a bad friend just for asking for something different or more comfortable for me.\n\nI guess I’m just feeling weird right now. Like… am I reading too much into things? Am I being overly sensitive? Or are these red flags in a friendship that’s become kind of one-sided? I’m trying to be self-aware here, but I also feel kind of disrespected. So—AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi. So the title says it all. I’ll give a bit of a backstory…\n\nSo I used to have a lot of respect towards my sister, I tried helping her when she asked, was supporting her in any way I could, just did my best to be a good sibling. However. Recently I’ve been noticing that she has little to no respect towards me. She owes me some money, and she’s been promising for quite some time to pay it back, but it’s always empty promises, or just excuses why she can’t pay it back. She had money to go on a vacation abroad, she has money to buy useless stuff that she doesn’t need, but she’s doesn’t have money to return to me. And it’s not a huge sum. \n\nRecently she promised to pay me back when she gets paid, the day she should’ve gotten paid, she said that there was an issue with the bank, and told me that she’ll send it the next day, the next day - still nothing, and she told me that she spent it all. That was it, that was the last straw. \n\nWeek later I demanded that she pay it back right away, but she told me “oh I’m not gonna drop everything, just because you need something and run to help you, and I don’t have time for you. I will send it when I want to.” So I told her that she’d better send it, and not just the recent debt, but older one too, which of course she refused to do. Then I told her that I’ll wait for it until Friday morning, and of course, still nothing. I messaged her, told some harsh things, she told me some harsh things (I was super angry tbh) and then to mock me, sent me 10$. \n\nFew hours later she said “I don’t care, I was the only one supporting you (I’m trans btw) but no more! And at least I don’t have to remind everyone of my gender. And just so you know, you’re dead to me.” Then she blocked me. The funny thing is, she’s never been supportive, I’ve always asked her to use my preferred pronouns, and name, and she never did. The only one who needed reminding about my gender was her. And I’ve started to emotionally prepare for something like “you’re dead to me” situation. \n\nSo AITA for demanding my sister pays me money she owes me, because I understood that she had little to no respect towards me? \n\nP.S. I wanted to add that family life during my childhood wasn’t great, had little contact with my parents and siblings, was living with my grandma until I turned 18 and she kicked me out. And my sister added that mother is more interested in her life than mine, which I told her that I know that and that I’ve made peace with it. ",

A few years ago when they were entering HS I made a deal with them, if they kept a B average their entire time in high school I would buy them any car of their choosing, within reason of course. We added a clause that they got 1 semester forgiven, so they were able to mess up one semester and I wouldn't hold it against them, I felt like 7/8 semesters with a b average was pretty fair. \n\nSo my neice maintained her grades, she did mess up her sophomore year but otherwise was right on track. My nephew on the other hand pretty much never did right, we were lucky that he even passed every semester. I offered help, tutors, books, tried to make sure he was okay mentally, whatever he needed but turns out he just straight up was not doing his work. He was doing good on tests but would never do his actual work resulting in his grades being low. \n\nSo last week was when my neice got her car, she choose a 2025 Toyota camry. My nephew kept asking when he was going to get his, and I told him he didn't stick to his end of the agreement so he did not get a car. He still got a very nice gift back at graduation. Now, him and his mom are angry with me and saying im favoring my neice and now he is refusing to speak to me or his sister. I don't think I messed up but I'm starting to worry, AITA?\n",

      "scenario_description": "For added context, I (36F) don't have any pets because I don't want them and the added responsibility of having them - going for walks, medical needs or general trips to vet, grooming them, and cleaning up after their business, plus I am also away for work often. She (34F) knows this. She recently got pregnant, and as you know pregnant women should limit their intereaction with litter. We get along fairly well I would say. She and her bf (lives 40mins away) lightheartedly said that \"It's your (my) responsibility to clean the kitty litter now\". We live a block away from each other and I am excited about the baby and want to help and provide support as best as I can, just not with that. I feel like a shitty sister, but I also don't want to do it. AITA?\n\nUpdate -\nWow! I did not expect this many responses. Thank you everyone. To answer similar questions in the thread:\n1. This is a fairly new relationship (between sis and her bf). Despite that they did plan to get pregnant. I don't ask many questions regarding that - to each their own. \n2. I do not know their plans to cohabitate, for now, as far as I know, they will continue to live 40 mins apart. Though this question isn't about them.\n3. My sister moved a block away from me a year ago to be closer to me, and likes the area, which I've lived in for 5 years.\n4. The BF is not a terrible guy, he is very much involved and an intentional participant in this whole process, which makes their comment of me taking care of the kitty litter even more confusing. With his work schedule, he visits/stays over 1-3 per week, that I know of. \n5. Yes, their comment was light-hearted, in the way that you add an \"lol\" to a rather risky thing to say. \n6. The cat has been hers for 2 years, and is an indoor cat. ",

You really should take this opportunity to show your sister that you are NOT going to be the solution to her problems now that she is starting a family. You can offer to help, when and if you can, but never should she think she can demand that help. If they do have a bunch of cats then you definitely should not assume litter duty.

      "scenario_description": "Alt account so I don't doxx my main. \n\nMy ex and I split up about three years ago. No bad feelings, we just drifted apart until we realised that we were now co-parents not husband and wife any more. We have two kids, 13 and 10. My ex used to work as an infrastructure engineer and I was working as an owner driver with my own truck.\n\nAt around the time the kids were born we decided she was going to be a stay at home mum, the trucking was going well and I had brought a second truck and a van so I stayed home doing all the planning and admin, while I had the trucks and van out.\n \nWhen the smallest started school the ex went back to work part-time but her time out of the workforce had hit her really hard and she needed to learn lots of stuff and basically she couldn't get back in at her previous level and had to pretty much start over. Over the years the haulage firm had expanded and frankly it was getting a bit of a pain in the arse, we were too big for where we were and were needing to move to a new yard so I sold it off for a reasonable sum and set up freelancing as a dev. (Did Computer Science at Uni). \n\nWe both had relatives pass away leaving us property and money. So we were mortgage free on the family home. When we split, I moved into a house that I had inherited, we basically split the assets in half, split the costs of the kids activities in half. And when we were sat looking at the money she concluded that she would need to go back to work full time and she would miss time with the kids, as they were with me the three days she was at work and every other weekend I felt a bit bad for that, because if she hadn't  been out of work for so long then she would be in a better place career wise. \n\nSo I offered to cover half of her bills until the kids went off to uni. She didn't want to at first but I said to her that she helped me out and had now suffered as a result so it was only fair that I returned the favour, it's helping my kids out, and I didn't want her to be running down the savings that was essentially the kids inheritance. \n\nSo this situation has worked out about as well as it can, we co-parent happily, everything is all good. Until she met a new guy. He's someone we knew from way back but we lost touch with. They started dating, she's really happy and she's talking about him moving in. Which I'm ok with, the kids get on with him and I trust her judgement and know that she wouldn't put anything ahead of the kids.\n\nSo I said to her, if laddo is moving in you won't need the money towards the bills will you? She said no she wouldn't, but she was thinking of putting it into the kids accounts. Great idea says me. I'll put some on their cards for pocket money and the rest in their savings. So that was what we agreed. \n\nBut when new chap found out he went up the wall and accused me of being controlling and financial abuse. A few of our friends have also said that he's got a point and that it looks like jealousy. So AITA here?\n\n\nUPDATE:\nEDITS and clarification:\n\nWe have joint 50/50 custody of the kids so I have no actual obligation to be paying anything, but that said, I don't want my kids to miss out on their many and varied activities so I carry on paying for half of those. Likewise I offered the extra money to help with bills because I wanted my kids to benefit from time with both parents and also to not have to live in a house where money is a worry. \n\nSome have mentioned when division of assets from inheritance and selling my business, these are mostly locked away in long term investments so they aren't available. We were perhaps unwise in doing this, but we saw it as the kids' inheritance. My ex would rather have worked more than dipped into that money for living costs. \n\nThe ex has been round for a cup of tea and a chat, it seems that laddo was indeed thinking that she was his meal ticket, apparently he had suggested moving in but NOT told her that his landlord was ending his tenancy on a section 21 to sell the property. When she started discussing money and his contribution he asked why when I was paying for the kids. So she told him if he was living there he needed to chip in, and that if he moved in she couldn't keep asking for money from me.\n\nSo she's upset and I think that's going to be over, in the meantime he's ranting to anyone that'll listen that I'm the typical evil jealous ex and controlling her with money.

She constantly needs to be the center of attention — at birthdays, holidays, even funerals (not joking, she cried louder than the widow at our uncle’s😭).\n\nLast weekend we had a family BBQ at my grandparents’ house. My older brother just got accepted into his dream med school, so everyone was kind of celebrating him. We were all congratulating him, taking pictures, etc., and Emily kept interrupting with stuff like “Well I got all A’s this semester” and “Ill get into a better college soon just watch” Nobody was really reacting, and she kept pushing it.\n\nFinally, when she interrupted again while my grandma was trying to do a toast for my brother, I just said, “Emily, not everything is about you. You’re not the main character like you dumbly seem to think you are” or something along those lines.\n\nShe went totally silent, then got up and left. Her mom (my aunt) called me “cruel” and said I belittled her in front of the whole family. My parents think I could’ve worded it nicer, but they also say someone had to say it eventually(good to know someone agreed). My brother said I’m a legend. She hasn’t spoken to me since, and now some family on my mom’s side are acting weird toward me.\n\nSo Reddit… AITA for finally snapping and saying what I said?",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway for context.\n\nI (39F) have been an ER doctor in a small rural hospital for 6 years. \n\nOne of the ugly secrets not everyone knows about hospitals is that valuables often go missing. It's deplorable, but in a place with hundreds of workers and thousands of strangers constantly coming in and out, likely not everyone is gonna be honest. So since my first day here, my coworkers told me to hide my wallet cause cash tends to disappear around here.\n\nWhat kept changing was the alleged culprit. In my first year, everybody swore it was a health technician, who eventually quit for unrelated reasons. Then they switched the blame to an ER nurse, and now to another for the past 2-3 years (51F Amy).\n\nNow, I believe that where there's smoke there's fire. That said, my own experience in these years has always been very positive. I'm known to be very forgetful and careless about my stuff, yet nothing has ever disappeared.\n\nAs long as I've been here, I've always refused to take sides. I'm friendly with everyone and, although I enjoy innocent gossip (like who's sleeping with whom), I firmly refuse to judge anyone based on voices alone.\n\nAmy has always been a friend of mine, we exchange jokes and sometimes confidences. She's in a rough spot because of health concerns with her elderly parents and I try to be supportive.\n\nWhat drives me up the wall is the general attitude in the ward. At least 3 ER workers have told me they personally witnessed Amy rummaging through coworkers' and patients' purses, yet no one has ever stopped her in the act, or even called her to the side to ask what the f* she was doing, or filed a report.\n\nLately I've been unwillingly involved in this drama, although I always tried to stay out of it. A couple of colleagues have openly criticized me for continuing to be in good terms with Amy, implying that if I keep being friends with her then I must condone her behavior.\n\nYesterday I finally lost my cool. I bluntly stated that I have the right to talk to whomever I want, that I've never seen a sliver of proof that she's actually doing what she's accused of, that adult people should have the courage to speak up when they see someone committing a crime, and that this \"Mean Girls\" attitude is more worthy of a kindergarten than a professional setting. As so, I'm now shunned by a good portion of my coworkers.\n\nI couldn't care less about what my coworkers think, but I'm torn about how I handled the situation. If Amy's actually guilty, of course I won't shield her anymore, but I don't feel comfortable jumping on the band wagon with nothing more than whispers and gossip.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to take sides in this workplace feud?",

      "scenario_description": "I (late 20s F) have been getting irritated with my dad (56M) about something he does, and I want to know if I’m justified.\n\nWhen we are in public, my dad talks about people loudly, using their full names. It isn’t usually anything bad, just “my friend Jon Jackson bought a lake house up in Minnesota,” or “my neighbor Kelly Garcia just had her first grandchild.” I don’t see any reason to talk about people in public using their full, government names. He lives in a medium-sized town, and there’s a non-zero chance that someone who knows these people will overhear and assume it’s some kind of negative gossip.\n\nMy dad’s been like this for years, but his hearing has declined as he’s gotten older, and now he’s a super loud talker.\n\nThe other day, I went to my hometown to visit, and we were at the farmers market. He was talking super loud about his friend opening a bar, and he was using their friend’s full name. I told him he should probably either talk quieter or quit saying the full name, and I explained my reasoning.\n\nMy dad called me a sourpuss and said it was disrespectful to police him. AITA?\n\nEdit to add: my dad’s not a bad guy and he doesn’t have malicious intentions when he says people’s full names. The problem is if someone only hears part of the conversation, all they know is he’s talking loudly about Ben Smith in public. They don’t know the context of what’s being said.",

      "post_title": "AITA for not agreeing to send gift money for my husband’s niece’s wedding?",
      "scenario_description": "I(35F) and my husband(33M) are married. He has 3 sisters and 3 brothers. We live in the USA but both from a country in EU. His family always considers us rich because my family is a bit wealthier compared to his (not significantly on paper) and likes sharing gifts. A small background, since we got married his family almost didn’t get us anything including the wedding gift but expected from us. Their reasoning is that we have ability to buy those since we live in the USA. Well, I disagree bc we are barely getting by financially since we are paying student debts, moved to another state, my husband was unemployed for a few months, and his business got some problems which created extra financial stress. On top of that, we had a newborn. They did not send anything as a gift for our newborn. Not a single item, and what’s worse is they didn’t even bother to check. Besides these, my personal feeling is that if someone cannot bother doing something nice for me, then I don’t want to go above and beyond for them. But at the end, we ended up sending gifts or doing favors for his family with nothing in return. \n\nAnyway, My husband’s niece(the older sister’s daughter) is getting married in 2 weeks, and today I saw my husband was texting with his youngest sister about asking some bank info. When I asked him why, he said it was to send money for his niece’s wedding. I was taken aback and snapped that they didn’t even send something for our little baby and we agreed on how bad this was. He said he doesn’t care what they do, it was his responsibility for his niece. I didn’t make it a big deal at the moment since my mom was in the room and I didn’t want her to hear our conversation. \n\nNow, I feel betrayed. The reasons are first, he never asked for my permission since we always take financial decisions together even though it’s not a big amount. Second, we both agreed how hurt we were when they didn’t send us an even small gift for our baby. Considering that not only my close relatives but also distance relatives send us many gifts. Not all of them were expensive stuff. I am not asking something pricey at all, something heartfelt like a small toy or a nice clothes would do it for me. \n\nWe didn’t have a conversation yet but would I be AITA if I tell him I don’t agree with him for sending money for his niece’s wedding gift after we did not get anything for our wedding and baby?\n\nEdit: I wanted to provide a few things. First, I am not native in English so I may use some words in a different meaning. Second, by gift giving, I meant it’s in our culture. If there is a big life event such as wedding or having baby, we are expected to gift in terms of money. And culturally, it’s transactional. For example, if my cousin gets married, my parents and I need to gift some money, let’s say $100. Then, if I get married, my aunt and my cousin needs to gift something with the same value. His siblings except 2 of them did not gift anything for our wedding. They also didn’t buy a small gift such as blanket or some household items. But after the wedding, we sent them many things for their kids/themselves. When our baby arrived, they didn’t even bother sending a $10 toy or clothing item. Those are the things I would expect at bare minimum to think that they care about us. I am not behind huge amounts of money. \n\nOne his siblings, youngest sister, she doesn’t have means to give them even small gifts, but I always make sure she gets something bc she shows she cares about us by constantly calling or sending homemade items. My main argument was that why we would go above and beyond while they don’t show us they care about us. Just wanted to update.\n\nAlso, yes my husband is entitled to his own beliefs and feelings. But taking an action without a discussion was why I got mad. We both agreed that we would stop providing for them bc we don’t get anything in return emotionally. I don’t want a relationship with anyone where I am the only giver. ",

      "scenario_description": "I am posting this from my boyfriend's account. And just a heads-up — this will be a long read, with a lot of details I believe are important, because I genuinely want to know if I'm in the wrong here.\n\nI live with my sister “S” and my boyfriend “B” — we rent an apartment together in a city that’s considered expensive by our country’s standards. To be clear, we’re not struggling, but we mostly only have enough for basic needs: rent, food, and occasional new clothes from fast fashion stores. My boyfriend and I both work, but my sister lives off money from our parents. We split rent and utilities three ways, but most of the groceries and household goods are paid for by me and my boyfriend.\n\nWe often treat her to good food, and just recently I bought her a new phone for her birthday since her old one completely broke. I gave it to her a month and a half early so it’d be more convenient for her, and she’s still getting a small birthday gift on the actual day — a dinner and some things related to her interests.\n\nA few days ago, she told me that she and our mom are planning a short trip abroad (3–4 days) at the end of summer or early autumn. They want to visit a nearby country where our uncle lives and plan to stay with him. But here’s the thing — he’s not a good person. He’s never cared about us, and none of us talk to him except for our mom. So expecting him to cover any expenses beyond offering a place to sleep is pointless.\n\nThey haven’t shared all the details of the trip with me, but they plan to visit a few cities nearby, and just for the transport alone it’ll cost them about $150 for each one of them. I know that doesn’t sound like much, but that’s basically a week of work for me. Neither S nor our mom works — mom lives on government support, and S gets some money from our dad (alimony) and a bit from mom and grandma. She keeps saying she’ll find a part-time job but hasn’t done it yet.\n\nObviously, the trip will cost more than just $150 — they’ll need food, entertainment, and it's important to note that while it's a neighboring country, prices there are higher than ours. When my sister first told me about the plan, I was caught off guard and reacted a bit harshly. I said they can’t afford it, and that this trip could impact my financial stability too. I also told her she shouldn’t be traveling with mom because their relationship is tense, and they shouldn’t rely on our uncle because he’s always acted like he’s above us.\n\nS didn’t listen — she just dropped the subject. I talked to my boyfriend and to a close friend, and they both agreed with me, but I still don’t feel 100% confident that I’m in the right.",

She is foreign and very flirty kissing me all over my face. She tells me I look so young. I tell her how old I am and shes like ahh yeah youre a baby! And then asks me to guess her age. I usually don’t ever engage in that game with women. I genuinely thought she was in her 50s. Drinks had been flowing and I guess I lost my better judgment and I guess (what I think is lowballing) 41. She is shocked and grabs her friend to tell her oh my god she said 41!! She tells me her age. Shes 37. Im mortified. She says “Do I really look that old?!?? I know I have wrinkles!” And I said “Oh god Im so sorry no no youre beautiful” Her friend says “I always say 21 no matter what”. I walk away from that situation feeling uncomfortable and really horrified. The rest of the night that woman and I ignore each other. To be honest, she was a rough looking 37…  I didn’t even think it was that bad to have guessed within 5 years.. I also think like if you look old don’t ask people to play that game. But again, I shouldn’t have even engaged. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I’m at a crossroads and I honestly want to know if I’m being petty, or if anyone would feel the same in my shoes.  Someone has repeatedly remotely accessed my private conversations.  I've discovered the likely access source and I'm trying to decide if I should take the high road and secure everything and move on or choose the asshole road and try to prove it/fight.\n\nMy ex and I lived together for years. Since I moved out, I’ve discovered a disturbing pattern: he’s repeatedly found ways to access my private life remotely. He’s dropped in on my Alexa devices, I’ve caught him catfishing me on dating apps (he admitted it), and I strongly suspect he’s still intercepting my phone data. And the worst part? He never fully admits it but he hints enough to confirm. He’ll quote things I’ve said, flash this smug little grin, and make comments that tell me he knows way more than he should. Enough to leave me spiraling, but not enough that the police care.\n\nOne of the first big moments: I was on the phone with friend having a very private, funny, kind of scandalous girl talk moment (not involving him). I said something I never would have said in any other context.  The next day, he said the exact same words to me. He didn’t just drop the phrase, he repeated it word-for-word, looked me in the eye, smirked, and walked away.\n\nAt the time, I had no idea what was going on. I went down every possible rabbit hole — hidden mic? Is my phone hacked? Did someone overhear me? Eventually I discovered he had access to the Alexa app I barely used and was dropping in on my devices without my knowledge. When I finally I confronted him, he laughed. He paid to replace my Alexas with Apple HomePods, like it was a joke to him.\n\nWe didn’t speak much for a while. But a few months ago, it happened again. (We have children we share custody of, the only reason we EVER speak). Another private phone conversation, another phrase thrown back at me. When I asked him directly, he just smiled and said something along the lines of, “You won't figure it out.”\n\nHere’s where I’m stuck: I know how to secure myself now. I've confirmed the source of access is likely attached to my old device old Apple ID and phone number, and access to my current Wi-FI.  I could reset my router, hire pros to reconfigure everything, wipe my devices, get a completely clean Apple ID, and just… move on.  But part of me wants justice. Or at least proof.\n\nSo… AITA if I don’t just let it go and move on, even though I have a clear path to do so now? Am I the asshole for wanting to catch him, for wanting confirmation instead of simply escaping?\n\nWould you fight? Or would you let it go?",

      "scenario_description": "I (18F) live at home and split time between my divorced parents — about 3 weeks with each. Lately, my mom and I have been getting into frequent small arguments, and I’m starting to feel overwhelmed.\n\nWe’ve always clashed a bit. My mom can be really controlling: she wants to know every detail when I go out, constantly reminds me about things I already do (like flossing), and is really strict about money. When I had a children's bank account, she would literally check it daily and question me about any spending. She has a decent income, owns a nice apartment, and her parents (my grandparents) are wealthy, so I don’t fully understand why she’s so stressed about money all the time.\n\nOne recurring fight is over how long I shower. I wash my hair twice a week, which takes me around 25–30 minutes total. I even turn the water off while conditioner or a hair mask is sitting — a habit I actually learned from her! Still, she knocks on the door to complain, saying I take too long. Today it happened again, and we got into another fight. She thinks 2-minute showers (sometimes even without soap!) are fine, and worries about the water bill.\n\nI’ve told her that I’m not being wasteful and that I literally can’t shower faster given my routine. When I bring up how she’s being too controlling, she gets defensive and says she’s just being a normal parent. I’ve also told her that I’d rather live more with my dad since he’s much more relaxed and not so critical — but I can tell that hurts her feelings. She gets sad when I say stuff like that, and I don’t want to upset her, but I also feel like I have a right to speak up since I spend so much time living with her.\n\nSo... AITA for calling her controlling and saying I’d rather live with my dad?",

      "scenario_description": "Earlier this week I (40F) was on a flight from LA to San Francisco. After I boarded the flight and was comfortably settled into my window seat in premium economy I got a notification that my seat had been upgraded to first class — seat 4F, another window seat. \n\nI gathered my stuff and got up to move, trying to work quickly because I assumed it was an overbooked flight and someone had been given my original seat. As I made my way to the front, along with another guy who had been upgraded from coach, the flight attendant (35F or so) told us to take any open seat. The guy (65M or so), who had been upgraded from an aisle seat, took the window seat. \n\nI asked the flight attendant, in what I thought was a quiet voice, if I could have my assigned window seat. I explained that I’m a very nervous flyer and prone to nausea if I’m not next to a window. She said no because they were “about to close the door.” \n\n(For context: I don’t mean to be high maintenance, but I witnessed a small plane crash as a kid and I’ve been scared of flying ever since. I work with a therapist on how to deal with it, since I need to travel a couple times per month for my job, and my coping method is Xanax + a window seat. When I’m scared my stomach churns. I don’t love it. But it’s what happens.) \n\nThe guy in the window seat overhears and gets up to give me the seat, but instead of doing it with kindness he rolls his eyes and loudly sneers “I’ve never heard of anyone throwing up because they’re not in a window seat.”\n\nAt this point I’m super embarrassed, and don’t want to sit next to this guy, so I said “oh this is clearly going to be a thing, can I just have my original seat back?”\n\nLuckily the seat was still open, so I sat back down next to the window. I truly didn’t care about not sitting in first class. It’s a short flight. The interaction has been bothering me for days though. Was I the AH? Am I an entitled person in the eyes of the other passengers? Was the guy? The flight attendant for not just asking us to sit in our assigned seats?",

You have to remember that no one on that plane knows the issue you have and no one on that plane cares about your issues. So bringing up that you need a window seat will probably be pointless. Also, what you did was equivalent to someone in a checkout line leaving that line to move to what they think is a faster checkout line. It carries the risk of you leaving an acceptable situation for what is going to turn out to be a worse situation. If you have to have a window seat and you are sitting in one, think twice before you leave it.",

      "scenario_description": "When I was younger and still lived at home, my family would have an account on each streaming service with all of our separate profiles. \n\nMy dad would often change the passwords to them just for safety as it’s recommended you should change your passwords to things every few times. But when he would do this, he wouldn’t give me the password and when I would ask he would say things like “well are you going to pay for it?”. He would say things like this as a joke and then eventually give in but that wouldn’t be for a while. Eventually I got sick of this and decided I’ll just create and pay for my own account to save the hassle. \n\nThis is specific to my Disney + account. I’ve had this account that I created for years now and I have been moved out of home for about 2 years so I’ve had my own streaming accounts.\n\nNow fast forward to now. I must have logged in to my Disney + account at my parents house to watch something with them and forgot to log out so they’ve been using my account ever since and only told me until now. \n\nI was a bit annoyed that they’ve been using my account without telling me especially when I don’t feel very independent if we’re all just sharing streaming services together (is that weird? Idk). \n\nI was over at my parents house and dad was watching a documentary on my Disney + account. When I logged into my Disney + account, I saw that it had been logged in from multiple areas that I have never been nor my parents have been so for the account’s safety, I logged out and changed the password because who knows who’s logging in to my account. This then stopped the documentary my dad was watching and logged him out too. Before I was able to tell him sorry I’ve just changed my password because of all these unknown logins, he has this huge meltdown because he thinks I did it out of spite and that it’s “unfair”. But it’s my account and I pay for it…… \n\nWhen I told him that I was thinking of deleting my account cause I barely use it and it’s another expense I don’t need, he has even more of a meltdown and again says “that’s so unfair, we do so much for you”.\nAm I in the wrong here? This argument just seems so dumb over a stupid Disney + account.",

So the second his eyes are open he gets on instagram. He is hard of hearing and plays his videos at full volume. We wakes up early on his own and immediately opens instagram and starts watching videos. I have repeatedly expressed that it wakes me up before I’m ready and is a problem.  He always says it was a mistake I didn’t mean to do that and I have explained it’s not a mistake if it happens over and over again it’s a choice at this point. It is worth stating that I just started my period the day before at work without knowing. And he has his own office downstairs. I also suffer from insomnia so it’s hard for me to get to sleep. I’m tired of going round and round about the same issues. We’ve had break conversations earlier in the week and all he ever does is say sorry without changing a thing. So am I the asshole or is he?",

      "scenario_description": "I (24F) have been living with my roommate, Sarah (26F), for about a year. We generally get along, but lately, there’s been tension over her borrowing habits, and I need some perspective on whether I overreacted. Now here’s an interesting problem, I own a car, and Sarah doesn’t. I’m happy to help out occasionally, like driving her to the grocery store or giving her a lift to work if her ride falls through. I’ve always made it clear, though, that I need advance notice and that my car isn’t a free for all. It’s not just about gas or wear and tear, it’s my only way to get to my job (I’m a nurse with odd shifts), and I can’t risk it being unavailable or damaged.\nAbout three months ago, Sarah started asking to borrow my car more frequently which sometimes for small things like grabbing takeout or visiting friends. I let her borrow it a couple of times after she promised to be careful, but I noticed she wasn’t great about refilling the gas or cleaning up like leaving coffee cups or muddy footprints. I gently reminded her to respect my car, and she apologized, so I let it slide. Last month, things escalated. Sarah asked to borrow my car for a quick errand as usual but kept it for six hours without texting me. I had to cancel plans because I couldn’t get to them, and when she returned, the gas tank was nearly empty. I was frustrated and told her I wasn’t comfortable lending it out anymore unless it was an emergency. She got defensive, saying I was being petty and that roommates should share resources. I explained that my car isn’t a shared resource and this is my personal property, and I need it for work. She rolled her eyes but seemed to drop it. Last week, Sarah asked to borrow my car again to visit her sister, who lives an hour away. I said no, citing the previous issues and my upcoming 12 hour shift. She got upset, saying her sister was having a rough time and she really needed to see her. I felt bad, so I offered to drive her there myself on my day off, but she said that wasn’t convenient for her schedule. She then accused me of being selfish and said I was holding my car over her head to control her. I stood my ground and said I wasn’t comfortable lending it out after she disregarded my boundaries before.\nSince then, Sarah’s been cold, barely speaking to me, and she told a mutual friend I’m being unreasonable and unsupportive. Our friend thinks I should’ve just let her borrow the car since her sister’s situation sounds serious, but I feel like Sarah’s not respecting my needs or my property. I get that she’s stressed, and I don’t want to seem heartless, but I also don’t think I’m obligated to let her use my car, especially after she’s been careless.\n\nAITA for refusing to lend her my car? I want to be a good roommate, but I feel like my boundaries are being ignored.",
