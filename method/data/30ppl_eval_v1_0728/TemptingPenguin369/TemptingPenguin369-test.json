      "post_title": "AITA for asking my friend to drive earlier to the airport?",
      "scenario_description": "I (20F) have been visiting my friend (also 20F) for her birthday this past week. Today she was supposed to drive me to the airport for my flight with boarding at 10:30 AM-11:00 AM. Two days ago, I told her we should wake up at 6:00 and be on the road by 7:00 to be safe. I thought the drive would be an hour.\n\nShe dismissed me and said we’d leave at 8:00 instead. Well, today I found out it actually takes two hours to get to the airport due to traffic.\n\nAt 8:15, we finally got on the road, I started silently panicking when I got a notification that the flight was arriving early and boarding now started at 10:00 closing at 10:30 am. She got mad, drove faster, and I told her to calm down and that whatever happens will be okay.\n\nI had already accepted I wouldn’t make it. Sure enough, the front desk told me I had to reschedule when I got there at 10:01. I was upset with my friend at this point for ignoring me earlier. \n\nWe drove home in silence and later I brought up what we could do differently to avoid missing my flight tomorrow. I suggested we be on the road by 6:00 AM again so I could get there 3 hours early.\n\nShe got angry and said that wasn’t going to happen. She her driving hours are between 7:00 AM and 9:00 PM. I reminded her that last time we woke up at 7:00, we didn’t leave until 8:00, and I missed my flight.\n\nShe got mad and said it was the airline’s fault for arriving early and that I shouldn’t have to pay extra to reschedule. She said we were on time and I tried to explain that most airlines say to arrive 2–3 hours early for domestic flights especially for large airports.\n\nI told her I can’t board a flight in 30 minutes. She said experienced fliers do it all the time. I told her this was my second time flying.\n\nShe said flights are never early and her family always boards in 30 minutes… I said that’s nice but I’m still a NEW flier. Eventually she just got even angrier and told me to ask her dad to drive me instead since he’s always up early but he’s already driving 10 hours tomorrow to get her siblings.\n\nI asked her what happens if I miss my flight again cuz I don’t have a car and I’m 10 hours from home and I’m relying on her.\n\nShe stood up, said she’d drive me if I missed it again, and then locked herself in her dad’s room and hasn’t spoken to me since.\n\nI’m confused. The lady at the front desk even told me to arrive three hours early tomorrow. I don’t feel I’m being unreasonable. I already missed one flight and I can’t afford another delay. \n\nI know we’re both frustrated, but sheesh AITA here?? ",

      "scenario_description": "My (36, M) sister (34, F) moved into my house about 2 months ago with her 2 kids (7M, 4F) after she ended a really bad relationship\n\nI’ve always been an early-ish riser and like to get up and make myself some breakfast around 7 or 8am. Nothing spectacular, just whatever I felt like that day\n\nWhen my sister moved in, I realized quickly that she liked to sleep in. Some days she was up as late as 1pm…I gave her the benefit of the doubt since I knew how hard her break up was for her \n\n\nSince my sister slept so late daily, she wouldn’t get up and take care of her kids. I got into a routine with my niece and nephew that basically whatever I cooked myself for breakfast, I’d make enough for them as well until the other morning \n\nI woke up and had an urge to make huevos rancheros. The kids immediately started complaining that they didn’t want that and wanted something different\n\nI was nice and ended up making them pancakes since it’s not their fault that their mom is really struggling \n\nThe next morning, I was making breakfast potatoes and eggs but all I heard was “we don’t want that. We want something different” so again, I obliged…finally after 3 mornings of my unwanted food critics getting a separate meal, I finally told them “I’m no longer cooking 2 different meals for breakfast. If you don’t like what I’m making, go ask your mom to get up and do it”\n\nSo, they went upstairs to wake her up, but she still didn’t come downstairs until after 1pm. The kids immediately started complaining that I “refused to feed them” and my sister was PISSED\n\nShe started in about how they need to be fed by a certain time and a bunch of other things that she said to try and intentionally hurt me\n\nI snapped and told her “look I know you’re depressed, but wake up and take care of your fu**ing kids instead of expecting me to do it”\n\nShe got quiet after that and is still giving me the cold shoulder, but I know she’s expecting me to apologize.\n\nSorry this was long winded, but let me have it. AITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I'm from South America and I lead a small team of seven (six women and one man). My team members all earn the legal minimum wage (about 1400 pesos/month) plus a small performance-based commission.\n\nThe man on our team is turning 23. He's a huge Real Madrid fan. A teammate had the idea to chip in for his birthday gift: a high-quality counterfeit jersey for 200 pesos. The rest of the team loved the idea. To put the price in perspective, an official jersey here costs 600 pesos, which is nearly half a month's minimum wage. The plan was for the seven of us to split the 200 peso cost, making it about 29 pesos each.\n\nHowever, I have strong personal values against buying or gifting counterfeit goods. I told the team to wait, and that I might be able to get a discount on an authentic jersey through a contact at Adidas. I managed to get a 40% discount, bringing the price of an original down to 360 pesos. To make it work, I offered to contribute 100 pesos myself, leaving 260 for the other six team members to cover. This would have made their share about 43 pesos each.\n\nThey told me the extra 14 pesos was too much and voted to stick with the counterfeit one.\n\nI replied that if they were going with the fake, I was out. I couldn't contribute to it. Now, the six of them will pay about 33 pesos each. I plan to give him a separate, smaller, but authentic gift from me. My team seems a bit annoyed by my decision.\n\nWIBTA if I refuse to contribute to the group gift over my principles, even though my actions have made things slightly more expensive and complicated for them?",

      "scenario_description": "So, we have this thing where we’re super open with each other—like, everything goes. We talk about our thoughts, check out girls together (since I’m bi and he’s straight), etc.  Anyway, yesterday we went out for a movie and I got my period, and we couldn’t find a single place nearby that had any pads or tampons. I didn’t want to risk the whole “period mishap” at the theater, so we ended up missing part of the movie. I felt bad, apologized, and I could tell he was a little off, but he was like, “It’s okay, don’t worry about it.” So I thought it was fine.\n\nA stranger(guy) had complimented me in the morning . It was just a simple “you look beautiful ,” but it kind of made me feel good. I mean, it felt nice to be noticed, especially since it was just a straightforward compliment—nothing more. I shared it with him, and he didn’t really react much.\n\nFast forward to later that night... I had a bit to drink, and for some reason, I brought it up again. I thought, “Hey, we’re always open, I’ll just mention it.” It was nothing huge, just me sharing something that made me feel good. But then he flipped out.\n\nLike, full-on yelling. He starts going off about how we missed part of the movie because of me and then, he started talking about the compliment, saying how much it bothered him that I liked it. Like, it really upset him that someone else gave me attention. I was just trying to be transparent, like we agreed, but suddenly it was a huge issue. I told him that from now on if it bothers you I can not tell you small menial stuff like this. But he kept insisting that I should there won’t be transparency in the relationship. Not telling stuff is borderline cheating etc.\n\nHe also said that I should delete all my social media profiles because I should not be seeking attention if I’m in a relationship. And that he had a really bad day because of me ,missing the movie and then a fight. \n\nAITA? \n\nP.s we have had a very good relationship no history of straying or anything and have been together almost 2 years. He has had a history of being more controlling/ jealous compared to me even tho I have never given him a reason to. I quite literally always speak what’s on my mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He started bragging about how he got a lot more matches than me and told me to suck it up and stuff. I tried to let it slide telling myself it’s alright he’s just teasing me. However he started bragging to our mutual friends about our “competition” (mind you it was never supposed to be a literal competition)  \n\nI then told him well if you are such a catch why did you only put pictures above your shoulders? I jokingly said I guess you had to play it safe huh.\n\nHe asked me what I meant by that and I said you know exactly what I mean.\n\nMy friend is in a wheelchair, I never held that against him up until that point and I felt so bad afterwards for bringing that up but I had to because he kept bragging about his so-called victory and it started getting under my skin. \n\nI told him he basically manipulated the game because we both know he wouldn’t get half of those matches if he put full body pictures and those matches he got don’t translate into real world. (He tried other dating apps before and couldn’t really get matches, only times he could any get matches where when he didn’t put any pictures w his wheelchair and even then girls would ignore him when he disclosed he’s in a wheelchair) \n\nHe said fuck you and called me a pathetic loser of a friend. \n\nAITA? \n",

I give him this reasoning, and he says yes, I can have his share. Fastforwards to after dinner, I ask my mom if she'd like me to serve dessert, and she says yes (obviously, who doesn't want cheesecake?) my dad then chimes in and says he would like to be served, to which I reply to him that he didn't want it earlier because he is \"trying\" to be healthy. So I serve the cheesecake to everybody except for him, finishing the cheesecake completely. He then gets mad at me (for trying to protect his health I might add) and now I'm left wondering if what I did was unreasonable. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (21m) was hanging out with my closest friend group (5 guys total) I’ve had since high school when something odd happened. Suddenly, after years of using the word himself (and all of us regularly using it), one friend (D) was taken aback by another friend (N) saying the word “retarded.”\n\nHe made a big deal of it being a “slur” and shamed N for using it liberally. When N questioned this shift, D replied, “Why use a slur? It’s just not cool to say anymore.”\n\nFor context, we’ve been super close since freshman year of high school. Now, the summer before senior year of college, we’re still close but less so due to naturally attending different schools. We used to hang out every weekend—smoking weed, drinking beers, playing Super Smash Bros, DnD, etc. We’re not big “trash-talkers” either; growing up in a nice area with solid education instilled values of kindness and respect. We’re mostly just goofy nerds.\n\nThere’s an unspoken understanding that we’re generally left-wing. Growing up in progressive areas instilled these ideals. I’ve personally shifted slightly toward the center after finding my place in the world, but I remain a big proponent of basic human rights and equality. Same goes for everyone else in the group. When we made “edgy” jokes, it was always understood as satire—funny because it’s opposite of our real beliefs. For example, making Hitler jokes since 4 out of 5 of us are Jewish.\n\nNow, six years later, there’s a sudden shift in group vibe—not because N and I desperately need to say “oh that was retarded” during Smash, but because there’s now tension and authority in the group. D and another guy (R) are suddenly very anti-slur, while N and I (still quite left-wing in our beliefs) see no issue as long as these words aren’t used derogatorily. That just wouldn’t be cool. The last guy (J) seems neutral—probably doesn’t care about “slurs” and just wants to have fun.\n\nNo one even used “retard” specifically to be funny. Maybe in funny situations, sure, but it’s more synonymous with “stupid” than purely for shock value. The sudden contempt for this usage seems to give D and R an air of superiority, as if censoring these words makes them more mature. If it slips now, the vibe immediately feels off (though we avoid comments or lectures if lucky).\n\nAm I the asshole, or does D’s sudden judgment of “retard” stem more from conformist indulgence in censorship among modern leftists rather than a genuine push for good?\n\nI understand removing it from medical dictionaries since it’s antiquated. I’d never use it for someone with disabilities. But bringing woke rules into a chill night with the boys? Seems retarded.",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 31F and my mom (Brenda, 55F) and I are honestly pretty close. But there’s this one thing she does that’s been getting under my skin for years. Basically, if I tell her anything about my life, she’ll go and talk about it with the whole extended family. Like... everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins, even random relatives I barely know or haven’t seen in forever. Nothing’s too small—she’ll mention stuff about who I’m seeing, stuff with my job, health stuff, money stuff... just everything.\n\nI’ve told her to stop doing that so many times. Like I’ll say “hey, I don’t want anyone else knowing about this,” and she’ll nod like she gets it—but then later I hear she’s been talking. And when I call her out, she always says something like, “Oh, come on, it’s just family!” or “I wasn’t gossiping, I was just chatting.” Like??? That doesn’t really make it better.\n\nAnyway, not long ago I had this minor medical thing done—nothing serious, but definitely personal. I told her ahead of time, super clearly, that I didn’t want anyone else knowing. Just wanted to keep it to myself.\n\nThen like three days later, I start getting these “how are you feeling??” texts from a bunch of my aunts. And yep—turns out my mom told them. Again.\n\nI was honestly so frustrated. I called her and told her straight up that I felt like she didn’t respect my privacy, and that I was hurt she went and told people again after I asked her not to. I told her I need her to stop sharing my life like that—it’s not just casual chatting when it’s stuff I asked her to keep private.\n\nShe got really upset. Said I was attacking her, said I was overreacting and being cold, and now she won’t talk to me. My dad says I should’ve handled it “more gently” and that I made her feel bad. So now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far.\n\nWas I the asshole for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "I (17F) am a high school student taking college courses through an official program. That class is totally fine as I’m properly enrolled and everything.\n\nBut I’ve also been sitting in on another class at the same college just because I’m really interested in the subject. I’m **not** enrolled in that one, and technically the college rules say you’re not allowed to attend classes you’re not registered for. But it’s kind of an open secret that lots of students do it, and most professors either don’t notice or don’t care. So I figured it was harmless.\n\nThe class is large (maybe 50 people), and I sit in the front row, and I ended up becoming friends with the only other person in front. So I’m pretty visible to the professor.\n\nI sometimes use my phone during class—usually to look things up, but also occasionally just to scroll if the lecture gets slow or repetitive (e.g. when someone asks a stupid question or the professor is going over something I already know). Everyone else is on laptops or iPads, and I didn’t think using a phone was that different.\n\nBut the other day I had to miss class, and my friend told me the professor went on a **3-minute rant** about how phones aren’t allowed in class, how it’s in the syllabus, and how he wants to report the person using one. My friend said it was *definitely* about me because no one else uses a phone and he ranted just when I was gone.\n\nHere’s the thing: I never saw the syllabus because I’m not actually in the class. I didn’t realize phone use was such a big deal. I’m not earning credit or anything, I just wanted to learn.\n\nAITA?",

Like I said he wasn’t in the country and he wasn’t supposed to visit any time soon so I thought it would be fine since it’s not like he needed it at the time. He doesn’t see it the same way and thinks I should’ve asked first since it’s his office.\n\nWe’ve had a few arguments over this with neither of us budging. Admittedly in our last fight I did get angry and tell him he shouldn’t even have a home office since he’s barely home which did unfortunately escalate the fight. Part of the reason I said that is because my husband was never happy about my sister living here even though it’s had a very minimal impact on him and I feel like he’s using this office situation as an opening to send her back home.\n\nI've already bought a desk for her room so she can study in there but AITA?",

I have 2 German Shepards, Jameson & Guinness. My house is their house. I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   \n\nThis friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  \n\nI backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.  If you just pet them, they'll leave you alone.  After a brief convo, they decided to leave. I told them they don't call the shots at my house about my dogs.   The rest of my friends were split on how I acted. Some said it wasn't a big deal to put them in another room for a few hours and others said I was right.  AITA?  ",

      "scenario_description": "I kind of offended one of my friends the other day and it’s been bothering me. Most of our shared friends aren’t bothered, but his closest friend is definitely pissed off at me so I’m wondering if I was the asshole in this situation. \n\n\n\nOur friend group met through the local music scene and we all live within like ten minutes of each other. Last weekend, we all went out with a few other people (a bunch of guys who played the previous night and Taylor’s gf, Jade f26) for brunch after getting drunk the night before. This is normal for us.\n\n\n\nContext: a few of us have eating disorders. I (m22) do, Edward (m27) does, David (m20) does and we often talk about our disorders and other people’s together. If you’ve never had an ED, you won’t know this but we’re all obsessed with our disorders. It helps us cope, I guess. All of us, including Taylor, also have pretty dark senses of humor too. We joke about each other’s drug use, David’s dead dad, my health problems (related to my ED), each other’s body issues and more. Taylor’s never had a problem with it before.\n\n\n\nAt brunch, me and Edward just got iced coffee and Jade got a diet coke, so Taylor was one of the only people at our table actually eating. Everyone else we went with at the other tables were eating a lot, so it’s not like Taylor stood out that much or anything. After a while, I started talking about some celebrity’s weight loss to David because we both heard about it online. I was just talking to David but Jade kept giving me weird looks the whole time until she left for the bathroom.\n\n\n\nTaylor ate his food kind of fast and then said he was going out for a cigarette before leaving the diner. A few minutes later, I finished my coffee and I wanted to smoke too so I went outside and into the alley behind the restaurant. As soon as he heard me, Taylor looked up in a kind of panicked way and took his fingers out of his mouth, totally covered in vomit.\n\n\n\nThe moment was super uncomfy, since I just caught him purging, so I made a stupid kind of joke to lighten things up. I said that Edward and David each owe me twenty bucks, because Edward bet Taylor was orthorexic and David thought he wasn’t disordered at all but I was right that he was bulimic. It’s not out of place, considering our humor but Taylor looked upset and begged me not to tell Jade.\n\n\n\nLater, Edward said what I said to Taylor was really fucked up. He’s normally really close to Taylor but now Taylor isn’t talking to him and now he’s taking it out on me. David thinks everyone knows about our EDs now so he’s upset about that. If I did do something fucked up, I think Edward is just as guilty because he’s the one who started taking bets on Taylor’s disorder. So AITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nI’ve  been dating my boyfriend (27M) for 6 months (I’m 22F), and honestly, things between us are great. The only thing that’s been really bothering me is how his mom treats me.\n\nHe told me that back when he’d hang out with friends or stay out late, his mom never really called him or checked in. But now, whenever he’s  w  me, she constantly calls asking things like why aren’t you home?  did you move out?or saying I feel so alone. I’m not saying she can’t check in, but the timing makes it feel like it’s about me. Mind you I’m doing all this cause I really love my boyfriend also genuinely wane to be friends with her. I don’t really have many friends or family here. Just my boyfriend.\n\nI’ve tried to be kind and respectful. One time I was at their house for about 6 hours, and she barely said a word to me. It was really uncomfortable, but I stayed polite.\n\nLater, my boyfriend and I were going to a local event, and I suggested inviting his mom so we could all spend time together. She came, but again she barely spoke to me. I tried starting small conversations and even offered directions since I had been there before, but she ignored me and started asking strangers. Later that same day, she made two new friends and was really warm and chatty with them, so it kind of hurt.\n\nAfterwards, I told my boyfriend how I felt, and he spoke to her. She apparently said a lot’s been going on in her life and she just doesn’t want more stress or new people to deal with right now. I get thatI really do. But when I’m trying to connect and she’s clearly open with others, it feels personal.\n\nThen the other day she told my boyfriendI wish I had a daughter-in-law to help me out and he said“She’ll help” referring to me. She replied, Oh really? I know you’re  going to end up doing everything anyway. That comment really stuck with me. It just felt like she’s already made her mind up about me.\n\nI’ve never been rude or disrespectful to her. I’m not trying to take her son away. I just want to feel like I can be around them without feeling ignored or unwelcome. My boyfriend keeps saying she’s just overwhelmed or shy, and I’ve tried to be understanding, but it’s been bothering me a lot.\n\nAm I reading too much into this? Or is this something I should be more concerned about?",
