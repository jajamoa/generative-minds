      "scenario_description": "For years my brother has been trying to go into business with my husband. It hasn’t worked out for various reasons but he finally had an idea that my husband thought would be successful. The thing is before my husband goes into business with anyone he does an extensive background check on them. I’m not sure if he made my brother aware he was going to do a check or not but it’s how he found out that my brother has a daughter outside of his marriage.\n\nI had no idea this child existed and my husband warned me I shouldn’t say anything but I couldn’t just not tell my parents so I told them a few days ago. They were as shocked as me as they also had no idea she existed and they immediately confronted my brother about it. Turns out his wife is fully aware but said she would leave if he tried to include his daughter in the family which is why neither one of them told any of us about her. \n\nMy parents want to meet her and include her in our family but my sister-in-law is threatening to leave if that happens so my brother won’t give them her mother’s contact information. They want my husband to find out for them but he’s refusing to get involved so everything’s a shit show right now. I personally want to meet my niece so I’ve told my husband if he doesn’t give me the information I’ll ask the friend he uses for background checks myself which has caused multiple fights between us.\n\nMy brother hates me right now and is blaming me for his potential divorce but I don’t think it’s fair as I didn’t know my parents would immediately confront him (I did ask them not to). \n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (34M) just came back from visiting some friends in NYC. Over the long weekend, we went to maybe half a dozen bars/restaurants.\n\nPersonally, I love trying new beers. If I see a place has one I've never had, I'm definitely going to order it (and log it on Untappd)!\n\nSometimes a bar menu is out of date and they don't have that beer anymore. Thats never a problem for me, and I just order something else. I always make a point to be polite and lighthearted whenever ordered too. This weekend I ran into a string of bad luck though. \n\nOne place had to dig around for a while for a stout. That makes sense since thats more of a winter beer, and I thanked them profusely and tipped extra.\n\nA second place had a beer on tap that apparently few people order. They said they'd have to change the keg if I wanted a pint, but I said not to worry and ordered something else.\n\nAt the third place, I'm worried I took it too far. It was a sit-down restaurant with a server taking drink orders. On their menu they had two beers I hadn't seen before.\n\nI ordered one, and the server had to go and check with the bartender if they still had it. She came back saying they didn't carry it anymore, so I asked for the other one. Again, she had to check. She came back with the other drinks, and profusely apologized, but their menu was out of date and they didn't have that one either.\n\nI apologized too, and made a light joke about poor luck which she seemed to laugh at. I then ordered a Yuengling (pretty common beer in the northeast, but not available at every bar, and it was also on the menu). Once again, she checked, came back, and they didn't have it either.\n\nAt that point, my friend piped up and said \"he'll have a Bud Lite\". I said sure, and off she went. As soon as she left, that friend said \"Can you please not make her job any harder than it needs to be? She has other tables, you know.\"\n\nI apologized, and it was a bit awkward after that. I made sure to be extra nice to the server and to tip well, but now I'm worried that I took up so much of her time.\n\nAm I the AH here? If a venue says they have something, i think its fair game to try to order it. Maybe I should have gotten a more standard beer after they didn't have the first one though?",

      "scenario_description": "This is on a throwaway because this is so niche and dumb that I don’t want it on my main. \n\nI (23F) have been working at a small restaurant with about 35 staff members total for about 2 years now. I get along great with everyone who works there, except for 1 girl, Mara (19F) who started about 3 months ago. \n\nI do not like this girl. I have tried really hard to like this girl. Mara refuses to do the bare minimum parts of her job (ignores tables, won’t do side work, won’t run food, etc), will cry and break down into hysterical sobbing when asked to do her job, or literally have a foot stomping, item slamming tantrums when the sobbing doesn’t work. She will lie and say that she did do her job, and belligerently sob when you catch her in a lie as she isn’t a very good liar and they’re very easy lies to catch if you just go back and check her work. \n\nAll of the trouble she causes ends up COSTING me money because if I work a shift with her, I’m the one waiting her tables, running refills, etc or else the managers will get cross with me for “not putting the customer first.” I’ve done a spreadsheet and I make less tips on nights I work with her because my tables get slightly more neglected when I’m helping her, while she gets to pocket the full tip from what are technically her tables that I waited on. \n\nMy coworkers thought it would be fun to have a “Christmas in July” potluck like we do for the actual day of Christmas in December and Thanksgiving in November. For both of these things, I made a homemade baked Mac and cheese to bring to the potluck both times. I adore cooking, and I adore sharing my food with friends, who I consider many of my coworkers to be. \n\nI wrote down that I’d be bringing food to the potluck, but when they asked me if I’d be participating in “luau Santa” (it’s just secret Santa in July 🙄) I said no, that I don’t really have the money with it being July and all. We’re not a tourist town and we really slow down during the summer, and I still have 2 pets and my little brother to feed while he’s out for the summer. I made excuse after excuse to not sign up for this part. \n\nMy managers kept asking and asking and asking if that was the real reason, until I finally told them that it’s not just that I don’t have the money, it’s that I don’t want to risk getting paired with Mara and having to buy her something, so I won’t sign up at all. I just can’t justify spending money on her in my head when I know that she already costs me money every time I work with her. My managers think I’m the AH for refusing to play, because we need an even amount of people, I told them to stop bothering me about it or I wouldn’t bring anything at all to the potluck. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I have a friend who I'll call Dave.  He has a limited social circle, has a speech impediment and a low paying job.  He isn't on disability but probably could be if he tried.  Recently for his birthday he said on Facebook that all he wants for his birthday is an Amazon gift card.  \n\nNow I don't normally get my guy friends birthday gifts, but I decided to for Dave.  He said to ke he just wanted like a 15 dollar gift card, for like a game or something, but I decided to be generous and get him a 50 dollar card.\n\nThe card came in the mail on Friday.  I had taken him to lunch at his suggestion (I paid) but forgot the card.  When I got home that night I took a picture of the card code and texted it to him.  \n\nA few minutes later he messaged me saying, \"whoa!, thanks!\". Followed by, did you mean to send me that much?  I told him I sent him 50 dollars and he corrected me.  I frantically checked my credit card and discovered that I had paid for a $500 Amazon card.  \n\nDave was ecstatic and stated listing off the things he wanted to buy with the money, even as I told him it was a mistake.  He offered to pay me back the difference 20 dollars a month.  \n\nLong story short I got him to purchase a couple of power tools for me that I've been putting off buying (one of which was recently stolen), leaving him about 150 dollars.\n\nHe wasn't exactly thrilled with this but I believe him when he said he ordered these things for me.  That being said, he's a little upset, and I feel bad for this situation.  \n\nI'm definitely better off than he is financially, but I'm not wealthy.  I've got a mortgage, car payment, medical debt, young children at home etc.  I don't think I've ever bought someone a 500 dollar gift before, maybe my wife, but even her engagement ring cost less than that.  \n\nWas I am asshole for insisting he make it up to me?  \n\nEdit:  this Amazon card was purchased with rewards points on my business credit card.  We usually save the points to go towards a family vacation.",

      "scenario_description": "I (F17) am my Mother’s (F42 almost 43) Chocolate dealer. She is severely addicted to chocolate (no I am not kidding) so earlier this year we devised a plan, I would keep all of her chocolate in my room and give one bag or bar to her daily. For extra context, she is severely Bipolar and is going through Peri-menopause. She also was diagnosed with high cholesterol (one of the reasons why myself and the rest of my family don’t want her eating too much chocolate, along with the doctor)\n\nOccasionally she sneaks into my room at night to steal her chocolate, waking me up with the sound of her rustling through the bags. \n\nOne night she woke me up begging for a second bag of chocolate because she searched my room and couldn’t find it (I hid it in a different place since she did the same thing the night before) I obviously refused to give it to her and told her to wait until tomorrow since she had already had her chocolate for the day, not to mention I was trying to sleep (I have pretty bad insomnia and sometimes get no sleep at all) so, she threw a tantrum. Literally whining and kicking her feet on the floor. She then sat on my bed and refused to leave until I gave her the chocolate. I eventually gave in since I was so fucking tired and she left.\n\nNow, I’ve been on a diet for the past year or so and since she can’t control herself I keep all of my chocolate & sweet stuff in my room for when I do eventually want to eat it. \n\nShe once ate some of my chocolate that gave me as a gift for my birthday, without asking me. Eventually giving it back once she had enough money (she is a single mother, unemployed on benefits)\n\nLast night she came into my room again and asked if she could have some of my chocolate, stating that she would give it back. I said no and that she should wait until tomorrow, also telling her that she shouldn’t have ate all of her chocolate, otherwise she wouldn’t be in this position. She then started whining before going over and searching through my bags of stuff, I told her no and that she was being dramatic, deciding not to give in this time. She then started yelling at me saying ‘I have no respect for her’ and that I am ‘selfish’. Also stating that she gives me whatever I want and wouldn’t do this to me. She gets up off my bed and says ‘that’s it I’m falling out with you. Don’t talk to me’ and ‘You treat me terribly, I am your mother, it’s the least you could do’. Am I the asshole for not giving in and letting her eat my chocolate? Am I in the wrong here (and or an Asshole) or is this completely ridiculous?",

They are staying at my place since I live alone, and it has been fine other than one issue.\n\nI like to have the AC on while I'm asleep. I just like to wake up to a cool room instead of being possibly sweaty and hot. My dad wakes up every night around 3-4 am to go to the bathroom, and when he does, he also comes into my room and turns off my AC. I have told him multiple times not to do it, as I leave it running on purpose, but he just does it anyway. So found a solution. I put the remote on top of my wardrobe, as he can't reach that high. I did this yesterday, went to sleep, and I got woken up by my dad searching for the remote in the middle of the night. When he saw me, he asked me where the remote was, and I just told him to go back to sleep, and he left.\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, he told me not to hide the remote, so I told him not to turn off the AC, and there was a back and forth, but we quickly dropped it so that mom could eat in peace. So like I said, this is silly, but AITA for hiding the remote.\n\nEDIT: My English is kinda bad, sorry",

      "scenario_description": "For some reason this keeps happening to me where I find dogs on the side of the road. Thankfully, I have never been bitten or hurt but it stresses my parents out a lot. Recently this weekend, I was on my way to go antiquing and while on a road, there were two Amish drivers on either side of the road with a dog running between them.\n\nI thought that the dog was one of theirs just running alongside his owner but when I tried to pass to go around the horses and the dog, the dog darted out in front of me. I slowed back down and went behind the buggy again and saw the dog again dart in front of a car coming the opposite direction.\n\nFinally I shouted and asked the Amish guy if it was his dog and he said no so I got the dog in my car and took him to the nearest police station (they have microchip scanners there). From there he told me to take the dog to a humane society 30 minutes away as he was alone on duty and most likely the dog was Amish.\n\nMy parents told me I was an asshole because I should have left the dog alone and it would have found its way home eventually and now because the dog was nearly 45 minutes away they might not know to contact that shelter to find it. They said I essentially kidnapped this dog and he would never go back to his family.\n\nThe dog was also really scared when he went into the shelter and I feel bad that he's going to be potentially stuck in there a while alone. He was a very sweet boy and while in the car kept trying to snuggle, give kisses and loved lots of pets.\n\nHe had no collar on and it was about 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33.3 Celsius) and again he was running in traffic so I wanted to make sure he was safe but now I'm worried I should done more to find his owners ASAP.\n\nI did put some flyers in mailboxes along the road but I still feel guilty over the fact I may have potentially separated this dog from this family forever.",

That drama was forever ago.” She called me “dramatic” and said I was “holding grudges,” like I’m the problem for not wanting to hang with someone who trashed me.

I have a zero hour contract job which doesn’t offer me a lot of hours (yes I’ve applied for many other jobs for months but keep getting rejected due to lack of experience) so I unfortunately don’t have a lot of money and my student finance only allows me £12 a week for food after paying my rent. My boyfriend on the other hand makes a lot of money from different sources (he makes beats and sells them to rappers for lots of money, plays tennis at a level where there’s monetary prizes and as silly as it sounds he is good at betting so had made money from that). He’s mentioned before we went LD that he has lots of money and almost everyday he goes out to restaurants, cafes and goes shopping with his friends so is constantly spending money. He claims he loves and misses me sooooo much and that he can’t wait to see me again yet has never offered to pay for my flight (London to Turkey). He now claims he’s got no money and is in debt due to starting up 2 companies, he’s shown me his expenses which check out I guess, but like I mentioned before he’ll still buy things such as a new electric guitar, new designer clothes and shoes etc despite having no money when it comes to me visiting. I think a part of it might be that I feel unimportant since he always seems to have money for things other than seeing me despite saying how much he misses me and hates being away from me and wishes there was something he could do. I have never asked for him to pay and have explained my financial situation to him so he is aware of that, but also if I had the money to pay I’d be happy to because I miss him so much and just want to go see him. \nMy friends say if he loves me as much as he claims and he misses me loads like he says he does he should pay for my flight to go see him, I shouldn’t have to and I’m not sure if I 100% agree. I guess maybe a factor could be the relationship is still in its early days so paying for my flight would seem like a “big commitment” this early on(?) or that he might not want to spend that much on me right now. He’s paid for things for me before when we were together in person such as food out so it’s not like he’s a stranger in that department. Also for more context he’s Italian and grew up in Italy then Turkey for a bit so I’m not sure on their cultural norms regarding relationships as if that’s an important factor I’ll need to take it into consideration. \nI guess my main point is my friends are constantly telling me if he loves me and wants to see me he’d pay for me so I’m left questioning if that’s true, and if it is then that means he doesn’t really love me and miss me as much as he says he does. Or is that the wrong way to approach it. \nPls help a girl out, if I’m wrong just tell me politely no need to be rude I’m open to criticism if wrong x\nEDIT: Sorry forgot to mention he said for visa reasons he can’t visit me in the UK. He was only allowed here for 6 months I believe. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (21F) live next door to a family with 9 cats. These cats roam into my backyard and some of them spend basically all of their time in my yard. \n\nOne of her cats is very old, has cataracts and is very thin. She used to be very scared of me but I fed her and eventually she began to really like me. Now almost every day, she comes over, rubs herself on me and I pet her and feed her.\n\nI found out a couple months ago that this cat belongs to my neighbor since she told me. I didn’t tell her that I knew her cat previously. I thought this cat was a stray since she’s so thin and has vision problems. I thought it was awful that my neighbors let her outside since she’s literally going blind and ever since I’ve continued to feed her and pet her whenever I see her. \n\nA few days ago there was a bad storm in my area and the cat happened to be in my yard. I let her in to my catio and brought my cat that doesn’t like her inside. My neighbor’s cat was very scared from the rain and I pet her for an hour until she calmed down. She stayed in my catio the entire night even after the rain stopped, sleeping on an old pillow I gave her. I left the door open so she could leave when she was ready. The next morning I woke up to pounding on my door. \n\nI checked my ring doorbell and it was the cat’s owner. Before answering, I checked the camera I have in the catio to see if her cat was still there. She wasn’t. The camera showed she had jumped the fence back to her house at around 4 AM (it was now 10 AM). \n\nI answered the door and my neighbor asked me if I had her cat last night. I told her that I let her cat in my catio because of the storm, but the door was open the whole time so she could leave. The cat’s owner began yelling at me that I was stealing her cat and to never interact with her cats again. I told her I didn’t want her cats, I have two of my own, and that she could keep them inside because a few of her cats are massacring the bird population, and the cat I befriended is literally going blind. She got pissed at me and said I shouldn’t tell her how to “parent” her cats and called me a “pendeja” under her breath as she left. For the non-Spanish speakers here, calling someone a pendeja is like calling them an asshole. I found out later in the day from another neighbor that she went door to door telling the whole neighborhood that I tried to steal her cat. \n\n\nI think I could be the asshole because I befriended a cat without asking the owner, and I may have overstepped by telling her to keep her cats inside.

      "scenario_description": "So me (26M) and my girlfriend (25F) were making her cake for her birthday party tomorrow and I said that's too much sugar its disgusting I cant eat that (I was even disgusted to touch it). She almost cried telling me that's not nice her sister was in front and said the same too.\n\nFor context she nows I workout and I dont eat sugar and avoid procesed foods and carbs apart from sometimes fruit and honey in general while she eats everything.\n\nI had told her I would eat a small slice for her but after seeing the amount of sugar she put I rather eat my sole shoe than that and its not about the calories but the whole idea of putting that food in my mouth disgusts me. I guess she should have made a cake I could eat with fruit honey and almond floor for example.\n\n-edit: so I wanted to make update.\nIm never critical of my girlfriend eating \"unhealthy\" even i usually get her a desert she has one almost every day. I will occasionally when I feel she needs it try to encourage her to eat healthier but not with a negative attitude like it happened here. And I apologize and thanks for pointing it out and I hope you do better than me in similar circumstances. I will definitely won't repeat this again.\n\nAbout the comments telling me I have orthorexia I think you are right although it doesnt sound bad to me I'm just different? Recently I made some changes to my diet I primarily eat raw animal organs like brain liver heart eyes etc. Now even cooked meat somehow disgusts me and upsets and bloats my stomach when I eat it it even tastes tasteless. So I can say very few foods I feel nice when I eat them and raw organs are one of those.",

      "scenario_description": "For some backstory I am a twin. We share the same friend group as I go to a small school and by everyone we're referred to as the twins. This year I am turning 16, a big deal for me and recently my one \"friend\" has been making snide comments about how I should just be normal and share a birthday party with my twin. For some more context there are two birthdays in August. Mine and my sister's and my friend's. And since COVID happened me and my sister have had separate parties, due to us originally not having the same friend group. There has only been one year where all of our friends came to both, now they just can't come to mine but they can come to my sister's due to scheduling. This year it looks like there will be three weekends in a row where the same friend group is going to a party and unfortunately, mine is last. And I already know that this means people will cancel or my \"friend\" will continue her passive aggresive comments. While COVID has passed and it does seem a bit silly to have separate parties, it makes me feel like I can have one moment where I'm not just the twin. Now I totally understand where my friends are coming from but WIBTA for still having a separate party?\n\nEdit: I feel like I should clarify what the party would be for my friend group. It's literally just us hang out in my backyard, swimming, and eating some cake ",

      "scenario_description": "I 30f got married way at 18 to my high school sweetheart Danny 31m. We were happy before marriage but being married made us grow up fast. We were living on our own and fighting all the time because we were both in college and working, then I got pregnant with our son, now 12 DJ and he dropped out because we need full time income, so it made it worse between us. After giving birth, I was an emotional mess and felt he didn't love anymore and didn't desire me, so we split up. We were married but both moving like single people, mutually cheating was involved.  \n\nAnd as a result I cheated with his brother,Joe then 25 and now 37. I got pregnant again and felt so guilty that I told Danny and his parents. He forgave me and we decided to reconcile and raise the baby, our daughter Daisy now 10 as his and tell her when she's eighteen. Danny and Joe's parents sat Joe down and explained everything to him, that's he will be uncle not daddy. He agreed and we moved on. Danny and I stayed together and we have 2 more kids Rose 7 and Tommy 4. \n\nIn March of 2024, Danny hit a pole on a dirtbike and died right in front of us. And honestly we're still grieving, it has been a year but sometimes we still have hard days. We did grief therapy until insurance stopped paying but I try to keep up with some of the techniques we learnt. We talk about him and celebrated Danny's birthday and our anniversary this year at his graveside. \n\nNow Joe wants to tell Daisy that he's her bio-dad because he feels she needs a dad. I told him no way because my kids are going through the worst thing that has ever happened to them. Telling her now that Danny's gone will only hurt his memory. I spoke to Danny's mom, hoping she'll tell Joe to back off but she told me that he told them and they agree with him. I feel they are betraying Danny's trust now that he's gone because we agreed on the best option. Danny and Joe's mom is telling me that this can be a blessing from a tragedy and that I'm being selfish by keeping it a secret and depriving Daisy of her bio dad.\n\nI can't talk to my family or friends because this has been a secret so long. I'm just lost at this point. AITA?\n",

She got home about an hour or so before I got home from work, we were chatting about what we got up to, she said she hopes I didn't live off takeaway. I said no I made a spicy curry on one night and I put another couple of portions in the freezer, she burst out laughing and saying \"oh no is that what that was, I threw it away\" I thought she was joking at first but from the way she carried on laughing I started to think she meant it, I checked the freezer and it was gone. \n\nI got really angry I called her a b*tch and a c*nt (context, here in the UK that word is thrown around a lot more casually than the US) I kept throwing snide remarks at her over the following hours. She kept saying I should have told her that was mine. Even though I'd told her before she left I was planning on making a spicy curry as she can't handle spicy food and that was my opportunity to have it. And she'd just got home not long before me and found time to do that. I left her really upset and she refused to eat dinner and has been giving me the silent treatment since.",

      "scenario_description": "__Quick note - I already know I'm the asshole, this is more about how salvageable this is, if at all.__\n\nSo I might as well mention a couple things about myself.\n\nI feel most at peace doing small favors or thoughtful things for others, without caring about credit or recognition. I do it as much for myself as for them. Also, my head is a mess — I’m probably living with an undiagnosed mental disorder. The same thing that makes me \"thoughtful\" also makes my mind difficult to live in.\n\nI’m also someone who’s curious and often checks public info about people online, not to use against anyone, but just out of curiosity. I don’t apologize for that — I don’t think it’s inherently wrong.\n\nYesterday, while chatting with one of my colleagues (we’re usually just three in the office), I saw her throwing out some dead flowers. I thought it’d be nice to quietly replace them today. (For context: she’s gay, I’m straight, and I have zero romantic interest — this is purely a kindness thing.)\n\nWhen she came in today, I was in the break room. She noticed the new flowers, thanked me, and that was it for the morning.\n\nAround noon, when the attorney stepped out, she brought it up again, expressing appreciation but also a bit of concern about my intentions. __Here’s where I really screwed up: while trying to reassure her, I mentioned that I knew she was gay from things she’d posted online. Before my brain caught up, my mouth had already said it.__\n\nShe was clearly uncomfortable. She told me she never looks up colleagues’ social media, and that was the end of the conversation. (Yes, I know exactly how bad that sounds — no need to hammer that point home.)\n\nI sent her an email apologizing: \"It was never an intention to create discomfort, and I’ll try to be more mindful in the future. I apologize for any discomforts or problems I’ve caused.\"\n\nLater, I went to her office to see if she wanted to discuss more (publicly, to avoid seeming like I was cornering her), but she wasn’t interested. I didn’t speak with her again for the rest of the day.\n\nWhen the attorney returned, I explained everything, wanting him to hear my side first in case she brought it up. He seemed understanding, thanked me for my honesty, and thought things would be fine — though of course, that’s not his call to make.\n\nShe replied to my email a couple hours later: \"Thanks for your message. I appreciate your apology and your willingness to be mindful moving forward.\" I didn’t reply, and didn’t draw further attention to myself.\n\nI left work a few minutes early without saying goodbye — didn’t want to create more awkwardness.\n\nI do hope this resolves over time, but I’m also prepared for the possibility that it might not. I’ve already drafted a resignation letter in case she feels too uncomfortable or I decide I can’t keep working there without it being weird.\n\n__tl;dr: Tried to do a nice gesture, but overshared private info I’d seen online, violated a colleague’s trust, and now I feel awful.__",

      "scenario_description": "hey yall. for context.\n\n ive been talking to this boy for awhile and we started dating recently, like really recently. i havent dated in years and my mom was so excited to she ended up meeting him along with some other family members. \n\neverything was okay until he got kicked out. i obviously said he could stay w me (i have a 1 bedroom apt and live alone) bc i didnt want him to be homeless and i genuinely liked the boy. (i’m 21f and he’s 19m, little gap but not too bad.) since he’s been staying with me id have to what seems like force him to do basic things for himself or around the house, even taking showers everyday. he had no job first moving in, i have plenty experience in different places so i offered a referral to places i could get him in. took two/two and half weeks for him to get it together with a job bc he wasn’t applying or would apply to places who dont typically respond (i know they don’t respond from experience, i applied to a few of those places months prior). he finally got a job after being content with being broke. \n\nafter that, he kinda just.. did nothing?\nhe was living out of a backpack and i kept telling him to get his stuff, get documents for interviews, even just get his car. he wouldn’t until one day we got into a mild argument and i had to cut into him and “mom” him a little bit. a few days later he got his stuff but no car because his dad needed his car (he crashed his dads) so yk, understandable. but since then i’ve heard no talk of getting a new car or saving for one, what his goal is, if he’s saving for a place. i haven’t brought it up bc i shouldn’t have to, he should want better for himself. \n\nnow he has a job and stuff but a bucket of dirty laundry has been sitting on the floor for a week or so, like he refuses to wash them or expects me to. he keeps leaving crumbs and stains in the kitchen when making food and will let dishes pile up in the sink. he hasn’t contributed to the house at all and i’m starting to feel like he’s taking advantage. when i try talking to him about these things the conversation typically goes like this. \n\n“what did i do? why are you upset?”\n“i’m upset ab x, y, & z” \n“what do you mean? why?”\nor i’ll get an “i’m sorry” with no change. \n\nthese last few days we haven’t spoke and i texted him yesterday when i came home to a messy house. i told him i’m not living in a dirty space and if he wants to he can go elsewhere and that i’m tired of this conversation. he pretty much gave me an excuse as to why it’s no his fault and reverted back to the “why’s” and “what’s”. he didn’t respond to my last message and came home ignoring me. then responded to the message after i fell asleep on the couch. ignored me this morning and texted me again when i left for work saying that he doesn’t know what to do or what he’s doing wrong smh. \ni’m tired yall. \n\npretty much i’m asking would i be wrong for breaking up so soon and sending him on his way? \n\nEDIT:\n\ni made this post while being at work and i’m seeing that i missed some context. \n\ni let him live with me because ive been kicked out before and felt bad he had nowhere to go. he is friends weren’t helping him at all, so me being kind (now i realize, too kind) i let him stay with me so he knew that i’m here for him. \n\nwe also have previous history which i should have mentioned. i have known him since highschool, so this guy isn’t completely a stranger.\n\nand yes i was kicked out and me and my parents are on great terms now. i was kicked out in hs years ago.\n\nthe car crash wasn’t his fault either i should mention, a drunk driver slammed into the back of the car.\n\nlack of hygiene was never an issue before moving in, i never noticed that he stunk before. he also had a job before moving in and a car. his shit seemed together and he seemed like he genuinely had goals and was responsible. \n\nalso, when i say everything was fine before moving in, it really was. i don’t take red flag lightly & didn’t see any beside maybe some communication that could be worked on & was being worked on. i wouldn’t have agreed for him to move in or date him if i knew he was like this then.

      "scenario_description": "So Monday my aunt (26f) was complaining about a meeting that she had to attend online today (Wednesday) because she had no one to watch her daughter (5 months).  \n\nI volunteered because I’m (21f)  still very much on the fence with having children, and wanted to see how I could take care of one.  Ofcourse I told my aunt my reasoning and she agreed some the meeting was only gonna be about four- five hours. \n\nSo I get to her house and everything goes well. Until about two hours in, my baby cousin had a horrible blow out. To spear the detail there was poop all over her back and bed.\n\nThe smell hit me just as hard as the panic did. However I quickly composed myself and started looking for towels and baby wash? Baby body wash? What it’s called.\n\nI could find the wash or the blastic tub. So I leaned her against body as I tired washing her in the sink with dawn dish soap. \n\nI understand it’s not the greatest set up but it’s what I could find. \n\nIt wasn’t until her sink was slightly red/pink did I realize the water was hotter than it should’ve been. It wasn’t scolding but wasn’t room temp either. So I turned the temp down and washed her until the poop was all off. \n\nI then dressed her and placed her on the floor before changing her sheets. \n\nI threw them into the washing machine with a tide pod. \n\nThat’s what my aunt came out of her office because she heard me running, mind you all of this was about 20-30 minutes. I told her everything and she was furious. \n\nNot just because I used slightly to hot water or dawn soap. No she was mad about everything I did.\n\nApparently the baby tub and wash was in the kitchen in a cabinet under the microwave. And that the sheets was supposed to be pre soaked before being thrown into the washer because she does want baby poop in her Washington machine.\n\nMy aunt kicked me out and called one of my other cousins. \n\nWhen I got home my mom told me not to worry and my aunt is just being high strung due to stress. However I fell like that maybe I did do everything wrong and should’ve just asked her for help.\n\nSo Reddit AITA? \n\n",

Run it over the back of your hand to make sure it's warm, not hot). Your aunt should have showed you where everything was (diapers, wipes, bottles (and how to prep them), baby wash, basin, clean sheets etc.) and she should have told you to put any soiled sheets in a basket so she can clean them later (or show you where the soaking pail is). She left you very unprepared. Don't let this experience make you think you can't handle your own child eventually; you'll know where everything is kept and have your own routines for cleaning.",

I looked down, sighed \"fuck me\" because I really needed the caffeine, and started walking to the bathroom to grab some paper towels. A friend (24F) from my lab was walking in at the same time and she also darted off to grab some paper towels, but the second that I dropped it another older woman (\\~55F) from a different lab who was on her way out for the night started loudly yelling \"OP you need to clean that up!\" in a condescending tone down a hallway of private offices. \n\nI kind of raised my eyebrow and kept walking to the men's room to grab the paper towels, but a couple seconds later when she got to the doorway she yelled \"OP! OP come back and clean this up right now!\" and I turned around and yelled \"with fucking what, Kim?! Did you want me plop down and sit on it? I'm getting paper towels!\" She started yelling back \"oh yeah well you better be!\" but I cut her off and loudly said \"BYYYEEE!\" with a hand wave and all of the energy of \"fuck right off to hell!\" and she went on her way.\n\nThis was when my friend popped back out with some paper towels and asked \"what the fuck is her problem?\" She laughed when I told her about the exchange and said it was wild behavior on her part, but I still felt pretty embarrassed that I snapped at an older lady and childishly yelled \"BYYYEEE!\" in a singsong tone and waved her off.

      "scenario_description": "  \nThrowaway because my brother may have my main reddit. I (15F) have been drinking a lot of lemonade. Like. A lot. I use one of those big Stanley cups and go through a container of Simply Lemonade every 5 days. I know it’s a lot, but I genuinely love it sm.\n\nSemi-important context: two years ago, I fell pretty deep into a restrictive eating disorder. It was a scary time for my family, and we really try hard to avoid talking about it. However, I took the steps towards recovery, and now I can proudly say I'm basically 100% over anorexia. I’ve gained weight, sure, but I’m not unhealthy or overweight, and I'd rather be round than miserable.\n\nAnyways, yesterday, I was sitting on the couch, drinking lemonade, when my dad came home. I just said hi like I always do, and he greeted me back, then sat down next to me. He questioned what I was drinking, and when I told him it was lemonade he looked so weirdly upset. Then, he basically said I needed to stop drinking lemonade because it was expensive and that I needed to drink more water (sure). However, he then poked me in the stomach, and said, \"If you keep drinking it, you're probably also gonna get fatter. I can already see a lemonade belly starting to form\", and then he laughed like he said something funny.\n\nI told him that wasn’t funny and asked him not to talk about my body like that. To this, he joked, \"can't be mean if it's the truth.\"\n\nThis is where I probably became the asshole, but I got really upset. Once again, I may be chubby, but I'm not overweight, and while I'm not actively battling with an ED, I'm still pretty insecure. My dad is overweight himself, so I ended up saying, \"Not sure how my lemonade belly stacks up to your thirty-year-old beer belly, but okay.\"\n\nHe was taken aback by this and said I shouldn't talk about my father like that. I told him he shouldn't talk about his daughter like that. He ended up going upstairs and leaving me alone on the couch. A few hours later, he made dinner, and we didn't talk about it again.\n\nThis morning, I relayed the convo to my brother. I was still kinda mad at my dad and thought my response was funny, but he didn’t. He said our dad was wrong for calling me fat when I wasn’t, but that I shouldn’t have made fun of his body either. I said that if he took something a 15-year-old said seriously, then he shouldn't talk to kids again. My brother said I should still apologize. I just went back to my room.\n\nHowever, I've been thinking about that for the past few hours, and now I'm starting to worry I was genuinely being an asshole. Sure, I was offended, but you don't fight fire with fire. Another part of me thinks that it wasn't that serious. I mean, I just like lemonade, and 210 calories a day doesn’t feel crazy, especially because it’s usually my lunch.\n\nI don't know. Am I the asshole for making fun of my dad, or was I reacting correctly to the situation? Any help is appreciated. hhhhhh",

We baked brownies, played volleyball and just casually chatted about work and other stuff, but we always had some disagreements in between those activities. \n\nAt like 6:15 pm I needed to call my boss to tell him that my computer broke and the paper work I needed to send in 15 minutes as all gone and I will rewrite them tomorrow morning, but my phone was at one percent. I couldn't find my charger, so I asked my cousin where it was since she was the last one who used it. Well she kept making this teasing comments that she'll give it to me when my phone dies and why do I need it so bad. I DID told her about the situation that I was in but she laughed if off like it was nothing. After going back and forth for a few minutes before I exploded and told her to act serious for one time in the not so polite way. I know I might not been the nicest in this, but  we've had tension building up and this was my breaking point. She was stunned for a moment before looking at me like I just ate a spoonful of ants and telling that I had anger issues and I needed to check my mental state. After that day interactions were weird. I kept apologizing and giving small gifts to ease the tension, but she was extremely hostile and kept making mean comments about me. So am I the asshole for snapping at her? ",

Back in November, my girlfriend and I got into an argument about why I had two of my (female) friends pinned. I said I pin for convenience, I get a-lot of spam messages or messages from people I don’t talk to often, so I pin the people I talk to the most. My girlfriend only pins people extremely close to her, Me, and her two best friends. At the time, I didn’t want to argue further so after explaining myself, I unpinned them though I didn’t feel as if it was necessary, and reassured her that they aren’t on the same “level” as her. More recently, I made up with one of my old best friends (girl) and repined her because, again, convenience. GF noticed this when she went through my phone one day and was upset due to past conversations about this. This time, I reexplained myself, reassuring her again that she is obviously more important than her and that I shouldn’t have to adopt the same logic as her. \n\nI’m not sure if im in the right here but it doesn’t make sense to me for something as simple as pinning on iMessage to have to mean so much to both of us.",

      "scenario_description": "I had my second daughter a few weeks ago and named her Gabriella. My cousin's daughter, who is 1 year older, is also named Gabriella. For context, this is my grandmother's name (unrelated to my cousin) so last year when abuela heard about my cousin's Gabriella, she was so delighted to have a baby with her name. Seeing this, we thought my abuela would be even happier if her great granddaughter was named after her.\n\nNow, at the most recent family dinner I overheard a couple family members talking about how it was weird that I named my daughter Gabriella, because my cousin's daughter is already named that. As far as I know it's just a name that they like and bears no special significance/family name. I also saw my cousin and she was acting a bit weird/cold towards me.\n\nSince we have a big Latino family all in the same city (9 babies/toddlers in total) we all see each other quite a bit at holidays, birthdays, etc. I wonder if they're upset that it'll be awkward with the same name.\n\nI feel like 1) no one should have a \"claim\" to a name and 2) if anything, my abuela had the name first on my side of the family, so \"Gabriella\" has much more meaning to us. Another relative also suggested using nicknames to differentiate them, but my grandmother goes by \"Gabby\" so that's what we would want to use too; however, my cousin already calls her baby Gabby.\n\nAITA for naming my baby after my abuela?\n \n\n",

Now they’re mad saying I’m “creating distance” in the family and being rude for not keeping the door open all the time. My sibling literally tried to shut the door on me, trying to enter my house! I don’t see how wanting basic privacy makes me the bad guy here. AITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "Context: Been dating for 3 months. During graduation day, she would later meet her parents, and it was decided for me not to go there since I had an important meeting overlapping with her graduation plus there was all this fuss about whether I would meet her parents there or not, since if I would, I would have to sit next to them without even proper introduction. \n\n  \nAnyways, I somehow managed to get to the end of the meeting early and went there to surprise her, my thought was that my presence would be much more valued than the thought of her getting flowers at all, so I thought I need to get there ASAP until she goes out to see her parents. Basically if I took any detour to get to a flower shop, choose some bouqet, go back, etc, a lot of time would be lost. Also, if I wouldn't meet her parents, and if I had gotten her flowers, then they would know that I (as a concept of her boyfriend) exist and didn't go to meet them. I thought me and her had a mutual agreement on this. \n\nAnyways, once I get there shes not in her best mood (basically shes pissed but trying to hide it), and I found out that she would stay for a few minutes and thought to go and buy flowers from a local shop (found out about the existence of it right at that time), but then thought that since I am getting her flowers then I have to meet her parents. The meeting went very well, but she still argues with me, saying that I didn't do the right thing, and if I were to meet her parents anyway then me choosing to come to the ceremony either way was fully up to my hands, and thus by extension so was me showing up late and not bringing flowers as I welcomed/met her.\n\nI dont know whether this is toxic/delusional behavior or I am the asshole.",

      "scenario_description": "Throughout our relationship, she (18F) and I (18M) have had our fair share of differences when it comes to jokes. In the past there have been quite a few times where I have been in the wrong whilst defending jokes I have made, or jokes we have seen in movies and TV. She has helped me to think more about jokes and make sure they have actual substance to them, instead of just using people's struggles as punchlines, but today I am truly at a loss for what was wrong. I was showing her the Gallon of PCP Sketch from Whitest Kids U Know, where two old friends run into eachother and talk about their lives. One of them works at an office supply, while the other casually talks about how his girlfriend just got murdered because he put her up as collateral to a drug dealer. I thought it was a funny concept, to tell that to a person you havent seen in years, very casually like it wasnt a big deal, but my girlfriend didnt agree. She talked about how it happens in real life and affects a lot of women, and I said that it was a sketch, and that the concept of women being taken as collateral wasnt where the humor came from, but rather how casual the man was about it. Do I need to learn better empathy skills, and was I an asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "Posting from an alt to stay anon. My(F26) boyfriend(M24) Todd likes to make me cute videos for when I go on trips for work or vacation with friends, basically any time we're away from each other for more than a couple days. Recently I had to go on a business trip for like a week so he went all out and made a handful of vids for me. One video in particular was him interpretive dancing to Lady Gaga's Bad Romance, one of my fav songs. It is actually funnier than it sounds believe it or not. Little context, he was teasing me for how I go full stan when listening to og gaga. It really helped me get through the week and some very boring conferences I had to sit through as well. Anyways I get back home and I'm hanging out with my friends and they're asking me about the trip, and without thinking I tell them it kinda sucked to be away for so long but Todd helped me get through it. \"How?\" they ask. I felt kinda cornered so I starting explaining to them that he makes these videos for me, he made one special one for me etc etc. and it all sorta unraveled into me describing the gaga video. You can prob tell where this is heading. They insist on seeing the video. They give me shit until I just say fuck it and told them they couldn't tell him that I showed them. So I show them the video and they started making fun of him. They weren't just like laughing at it or enjoying the silliness of it but they're like meangirling the shit out of it and honestly making me upset. A week later me and Todd go to dinner with one of my best friends Grace(who saw the video) and her husband Mark who is also close with Todd, and I could tell they were both treating him differently. They seemed demeaning. Worse than that, so could Todd, and he was clearly he was pretty upset when we got home. Now I feel like I've at the same time violated my partners trust and atltered my friends perception of him, all while he has no idea of any of it. We've been talking about marriage and I feel like this could be something that could actually stand in the way of that, which would make this like the dumbest fucking thing to break up a healthy relationship over. I'n searching for ways to justify just moving forward without addressing this but it makes me feel more guilty than I already do.\n\nSo AITA for showing my friends his video?",

      "scenario_description": "Last night my friends and I (all 16-17F) basically had a sleepover at one of their houses, there were five of us in total. My friend has a queen size bed I think, so it was really cramped in there with not much arm or leg space. At one point everyone got tired of trying to make it work, so my friend Amanda (whose house we were sleeping at) suggested that someone sleep on the floor. She said she'll get some extra pillows and blankets for that person. If I'm being honest, I know that comment was made towards me because I am on the bigger side compared to my friends. I kinda just brushed it off because although no one said \"You're fat, sleep on the floor\" it kinda felt like they were implying that. Like soon as Amanda says someone should sleep on the floor, they all started talking about how small they were and they weren't taking up any space so it shouldn't be them.\n\nI knew they expected me to say i'll sleep on the floor, but I never did. Since no one offered, eventually Amanda slept on the floor herself and acted like it wasn’t a big deal. My friend Taylor said something like \"you shouldn't sleep on the floor in your own house, I think the person who takes up the most space should\". After that we wall just laid down and there was still little comments like \"its still not enough room, someone else should've gotten on the floor\" and \"I feel bad for Amanda\".\n\nEveryone did eventually go to sleep, and the topic was over. I couldn't stop thinking about it. The whole night everyone was throwing indirect insults at me and making me feel like i'm at fault for Amanda having to sleep on the floor at her own house. I do understand that Im the bigger one and it would've been more spacious without me on the bed, but they were making me feel really bad. I feel like they went about it the wrong way and once Amanda got on the floor they should've let It go. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My (late 20s) little sister (mid 20s) “Ellie” has an intellectual disability. She’s independent for the most part, but needs assistance for things like finances. She works, but has a maximum she can earn due to her benefits situation that I won’t be getting into here. \n\nBecause of that, she has extremely little leftover money each month. And by extremely little I mean none. If she does have an extra $10, she uses it to buy things for her cat. Ellie is incredibly thoughtful and kind as a human being. \n\nMy husband (also late 20s) and I have a little extra money each month, and we decided we would give some of that to Ellie so she can have a little fun. We give the money to her in the form of a gift card, usually to her grocery store, a coffee shop, or something else she likes to go to and do, like the movies. Unfortunately we don’t live close to each other so we can’t take her to do these things in person. \n\nWe chose to do this without telling our parents because we’re all adults and, we confirmed, it wouldn’t impact her benefits situation. This has been going on for about 8 months now. \n\nMy mom (my parents are divorced) found out about it somehow, however, and went ballistic. She called to say she was extremely insulted we would go behind her back to “parent” Ellie. She said we were implying she was a bad mom, and that we had no right to involve ourselves in Ellie’s financial life. We were shocked to say the least, and tried to explain it was just a little money ($50-$100 a month at most) because we love Ellie, not because we were trying to undermine her. For the record, my mom is not very heavily involved in Ellie’s life. She does help with some logistical needs around her benefits, but my dad does most of the work, and my mom doesn’t support her financially at all. She obviously loves Ellie, but since they also live far apart she’s a bit less involved than my dad.\n\nSo, AITA for this? Should I have spoken to my mom or dad first, before giving Ellie money?",
