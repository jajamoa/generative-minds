      "scenario_description": "Hi Reddit! I (F20) have been dating my girlfriend, let’s call her Angie (F21), for about nine months now, and I genuinely adore her. She’s kind, smart, funny, and just overall a wonderful person. I really do feel lucky to have her in my life. That said… she *loves* to sing. Like, all the time, but especially in the car. And to be clear, she’s incredibly talented. She’s done choir throughout school, she’s a musical theatre major, and she truly has an amazing voice. Most of the time, I love hearing her sing and perform. It’s something I admire about her cause god know I cant hold a tune to save my life. \n\nHowever, when we’re driving together, it honestly gets on my nerves. I don’t mean every now and then, it’s constant. For example, the other night we were driving home from a mutual friend’s place. I put on some music in the background and started talking asking her about her day. As soon as there was a lull in the conversation, she turned the music up and started singing. I let it go for a song or two, but when turned it back down and tried to resume the conversation, she gave me a one-word answer, turned it up and went right back to singing. This kind of thing happens all the time. I try not to be overly sensitive about it, but it makes me feel like she’s not interested in talking to me. I’ve brought it up a couple of times, but she usually brushes it off and tells me that it just passes the time, which it does, for her…meanwhile I’m driving next to what feels like a brick wall. Sometimes I try to sing along, but she’ll say something like “It’s not a duet”  in a joking way but I know she means it. \n\nI really do love her, and I don’t want to make her feel like she can’t be herself around me but I also don’t want to feel ignored every time we’re in the car together. So am I the asshole for wanting her to dial it back a bit in the car?\n\n",

Don’t let her off with a glib answer. She needs to really consider it and give you an honest response. Then fill in with your own words Joe it makes you feel.\n\nAsk her what she expects you to do while she’s singing in the car. Nonstop. Ask her if she has any idea what you would LIKE to be doing when you both are in the car and if what you want matters to her at all.\n\nAnd ask her why her singing solo in the car is so important to her that it is the only thing she wants to do.\n\nIf she engages with you honestly, the you two will be able to figure things out and find a mutually acceptable approach to meeting both of your needs/wants.\n\nIf she deflects, defends, minimizes, blames you, etc. Then she is not as great a gf as you think.",

      "scenario_description": "Apologies in advance, this is long — but I feel like I’m going to go crazy if I don’t get some outside perspective.\n\nI (26F) have a younger brother (18M) who’s about to start his undergrad in the US. He’s really excited, and I'm happy for him — but I’m also struggling with a lot of complicated feelings. \n\nWhen I finished school, I too had dreams of studying abroad. I went to an international school where almost everyone went on to study in the States. I applied to universities in the US and UK, got a few admits, and was starting to plan my next steps.\n\nRight as everything was coming together, my dad pulled the rug out from under me.\n\nOut of nowhere, he decided I wouldn’t be going abroad — and instead, I’d be going back to our home country. He sent out my applications himself, got me admitted to one of the top engineering schools there, and just told me that’s where I’d be going. End of discussion.\n\nThe thing is I never wanted to study engineering. I told him *so many times*, but it didn’t matter. His reasoning was that I needed to “get in touch with my roots.” For context, I’m a third culture kid — spent my entire life abroad, grew up in a different country, and studied in a predominantly American system. His decision felt like exile.\n\nThose four years of university were the worst years of my life. I was stuck in a country I didn’t feel at home in, studying something I had no interest in. I was numb the whole time, and I’ve spent years trying to block it all out. It still fucks me up to this day. My parents know how I feel, but they believe I should be “grateful” to have graduated from such a prestigious university.\n\nAfter graduating, COVID hit. I was stuck with a degree I didn’t want and no idea what to do. Eventually, I decided I would pursue a Master’s, but this time on my terms. Fast forward three years: I’ve built a life I love, I live in a great country, I have a job I actually care about, and I’m happy.\n\nBut now my brother is going to university in the US — the exact path I wanted to take. He said he wanted to study there, and they supported him without hesitation. And I’m finding it impossible to process.\n\nI feel so fucking angry. I feel like I was robbed of a future I could’ve had. Every time someone brings up his college plans, I feel like I’m choking. And so I stay out of family discussions. My parents have noticed, and when I tried to explain why, they called me jealous, fake, and ungrateful. They told me I have no right to be upset since “everything worked out in the end.” They said, I should be supportive and present during this important phase in my brother's life.\n\nBut it’s true, I am jealous. Not because I don’t want my brother to have this opportunity — I do. I’m glad he gets to live out his dream. But I’m angry that I didn’t get the same chance. That I was given no choice. I just resent my parents, and the unfairness of it all. And so I stay away.\n\nQuestion is: AITA for still being upset about this, even though things have worked out for me now?\n\n ",

TA are your parents (led by your dad, but your mom is one in her own right).\n\nContinue to stay out of any family discussions about brother's college. You may privately tell your brother that you truly are happy for him, but that this is hard for you and you need a little space. I hope he can understand. If he can't, then you can wish him well and still give yourself the space you need.\n\n(OP, this is similar to a person who's been trying to get pregnant or has recently lost a child, then a loved one gets pregnant. Being happy for the pregnant friend but needing some space to manage one's own complex emotions is perfectly understandable.)\n\nAs for your parents, limit your conversations with them as much as you need. Every time they try to judge you or complain, shut the conversation down. Either your parents (especially your dad) will learn to change how they talk to you, or you will continue to give yourself the space you need from your dad's backward, misogynistic, controlling view of you (enabled by your mom).",

      "scenario_description": "I (m37) have 3 daughter’s ages 15, 6, and 5. We’ll call my 15 year old  “Taylor”. I had Taylor with my College GF, we broke up when Taylor was just a baby (under a year old). We coparented well together. Now that Taylor is older, she comes here when she wants but primarily stays with her mom since she's closer to her school/ friends. I got married to my now wife 8 years ago, we now have 2 daughters together. Taylor’s always gotten along great with my wife and her little sisters. \n\nMe, my wife and all 3 girls went to Disney world for a few days. Taylor has always been a huge Belle fan. First day at Disney I had some work to do so I got up early and got ready and went to the lobby while the girls got ready. When I went back up to the room my youngest 2 were dressed in princess dresses and crowns. While my oldest had on a very what I would call belle themed outfit. When I saw the younger 2 I said you two look just like princesses. My youngest asked what about Taylor, Taylor in the last few years has been over the cute pet names. So I said I think Taylor is a little too old to be a princess but she's very pretty. Taylor said thanks but sounded a little off. I didnt think anything of it. \n\nWe had a good day, Taylor was distant with me but having fun with my wife and her sisters. I figured I would ask her when we got back to the hotel. Well I got a long angry text from my ex wife, saying Taylor had texted her that I called her sisters princesses but not her and said she was too old to be a princess and that really hurt her feelings I guess. I reminded my ex that Taylor has hated cute pet names for years now. My ex said considering we’re at Disney and Taylor was in a Belle themed outfit I should have thought that she might have wanted to be a princess for the day. My ex said I was being a oblivious AH, I tried talking to Taylor but she doesn't want to talk about it and hasnt talked to me much. My wife thinks I could have handled the situation better and made it up to Taylor. I don't think assuming my teen daughter wouldn't want to be called a princess is being an AH. ",

I have to believe you are a pretty good guy and dad to have the generally good family dynamics you describe.\n\nSo please just focus on telling your daughter:\n\nyou are so sorry that you didn’t see the princess in her in that moment. You have been trying so hard to prepare yourself for your first-born becoming a young adult, that you missed the joy of her being a princess. The truth is, she can be your little girl, a beautiful princess, and a capable young adult all at the same time. And you are sorry you hadn’t realized that until now.",

      "scenario_description": "So, I 25 years old live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Jake 26. We’ve been friends since college and split rent, utilities, and chores evenly. Our lease is month-to-month, and we’ve always had bills get paid, place stays clean, no drama. About two months ago, Jake started dating Sarah 24, and she’s been spending a lot of time at our place. Like, a lot. She’s here 5-6 nights a week, uses our kitchen, bathroom, Netflix, you name it. I didn’t mind at first because she’s nice enough, and I figured it was just the honeymoon phase. Last week, Jake sat me down and said Sarah’s lease is ending soon, and he wants her to move in with us. I was caught off guard but asked how we’d handle rent and bills. He said Sarah’s between jobs and can’t afford to chip in right now, but she’d “help out with chores” really?. I pointed out that we already split chores evenly, and adding a third person means more mess, more utilities, and more strain on our small space. I suggested Sarah pay a third of the rent and utilities once she’s employed, but Jake got defensive and said I was being petty and unsupportive, He argued that since she’s his girlfriend, it’s not like she’s a stranger, and I should be cool with it because we’re all friends here.\n\nHere’s my side: I get that Sarah’s in a tough spot, and I don’t want to seem heartless. I’ve been unemployed before, and it sucks. But our apartment is tiny shared bathroom, small kitchen, thin walls. Having a third person full-time would change the vibe, and I don’t think it’s fair for me to subsidize her living here. I pay $800/month for my half of the rent, plus utilities, and I budget carefully. If Sarah moves in without contributing, I’m essentially covering part of her costs, which doesn’t sit right with me. I also feel like Jake’s dismissing my concerns by framing it as me being unfriendly rather than practical.\nJake’s side, as he explained it: He says Sarah’s only temporarily jobless and will make it up later. He thinks I’m overreacting because she’s not some random tenant but his girlfriend, and I should trust she won’t mooch forever. He also said I’m making a big deal out of nothing since she’s already here most of the time anyway. He pointed out that she’s cooked dinner for us a couple of times, so she’s contributing in her own way. The conversation ended with Jake saying I’m being unreasonable and that I’m making Sarah feel unwelcome. Now things are tense, and Sarah’s been avoiding me when she’s over. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Jake, but I also don’t think I should have to pay for someone else to live here. AITA for putting my foot down?",

Having a third person to share the tiny space of your apartment\n\nOh wait, he is already imposing that on you at least 60-70% of the time, without ever asking what you were comfortable/ok with.\n\n2. Covering the increase in expenses from having a third person\n\nHmmm. Again, he is already imposing some extra costs (with the utilities, maybe food?, etc.)\n\nAll this for a person he has only been dating (known?) for two months.\n\nIn two months, He believes he knows her well enough in this time to know that she “won’t mooch forever”. Based on … what? I’m guessing his trust comes from the honeymoon feelings/ physicality. And he wants you to trust in his trust.\n\nI———\n\nPoint out to Jake the two impositions.\n\nIf you don’t want a third roommate, period. Then tell him that and discuss the terms and limits to having a frequent guest (like a gf) over for either of you. Keep in mind, your lease may also have some restrictions.\n\nYou can also point out to Jake that he can help Sarah out in other ways, that don’t involve making her a third roommate. E.g., loaning her enough for her to cover a month’s rent. \n\n[Sarah should have a little money, (or if she doesn’t) should take any job she can start immediately, can look for her own shared lease with her own roommate… She should be taking steps to help herself, not relying on Jake to give her free housing]\n\nI don’t think you want a third roommate, but IF, IF you are willing to consider one, some requirements you can insist on:\n\n1. She has to sign a lease and agree to split costs. He and her can have their own private agreement that he covers her share of costs until….\n\n2. A written update to house rules on shared chores, groceries, guests, use of common space, etc. Remind Jake that he is presuming that he and Sarah are going to be a long term couple.\n\nRules would be needed for a new ‘permanent’ situation AND rules would be needed in case Jake and Sarah’s relationship isn’t so permanent.\n\nYou aren’t being heartless. You just aren’t letting Jake’s heart and penis override all reason.",

      "scenario_description": "Alt account so I don't doxx my main. \n\nMy ex and I split up about three years ago. No bad feelings, we just drifted apart until we realised that we were now co-parents not husband and wife any more. We have two kids, 13 and 10. My ex used to work as an infrastructure engineer and I was working as an owner driver with my own truck.\n\nAt around the time the kids were born we decided she was going to be a stay at home mum, the trucking was going well and I had brought a second truck and a van so I stayed home doing all the planning and admin, while I had the trucks and van out.\n \nWhen the smallest started school the ex went back to work part-time but her time out of the workforce had hit her really hard and she needed to learn lots of stuff and basically she couldn't get back in at her previous level and had to pretty much start over. Over the years the haulage firm had expanded and frankly it was getting a bit of a pain in the arse, we were too big for where we were and were needing to move to a new yard so I sold it off for a reasonable sum and set up freelancing as a dev. (Did Computer Science at Uni). \n\nWe both had relatives pass away leaving us property and money. So we were mortgage free on the family home. When we split, I moved into a house that I had inherited, we basically split the assets in half, split the costs of the kids activities in half. And when we were sat looking at the money she concluded that she would need to go back to work full time and she would miss time with the kids, as they were with me the three days she was at work and every other weekend I felt a bit bad for that, because if she hadn't  been out of work for so long then she would be in a better place career wise. \n\nSo I offered to cover half of her bills until the kids went off to uni. She didn't want to at first but I said to her that she helped me out and had now suffered as a result so it was only fair that I returned the favour, it's helping my kids out, and I didn't want her to be running down the savings that was essentially the kids inheritance. \n\nSo this situation has worked out about as well as it can, we co-parent happily, everything is all good. Until she met a new guy. He's someone we knew from way back but we lost touch with. They started dating, she's really happy and she's talking about him moving in. Which I'm ok with, the kids get on with him and I trust her judgement and know that she wouldn't put anything ahead of the kids.\n\nSo I said to her, if laddo is moving in you won't need the money towards the bills will you? She said no she wouldn't, but she was thinking of putting it into the kids accounts. Great idea says me. I'll put some on their cards for pocket money and the rest in their savings. So that was what we agreed. \n\nBut when new chap found out he went up the wall and accused me of being controlling and financial abuse. A few of our friends have also said that he's got a point and that it looks like jealousy. So AITA here?\n\n\nUPDATE:\nEDITS and clarification:\n\nWe have joint 50/50 custody of the kids so I have no actual obligation to be paying anything, but that said, I don't want my kids to miss out on their many and varied activities so I carry on paying for half of those. Likewise I offered the extra money to help with bills because I wanted my kids to benefit from time with both parents and also to not have to live in a house where money is a worry. \n\nSome have mentioned when division of assets from inheritance and selling my business, these are mostly locked away in long term investments so they aren't available. We were perhaps unwise in doing this, but we saw it as the kids' inheritance. My ex would rather have worked more than dipped into that money for living costs. \n\nThe ex has been round for a cup of tea and a chat, it seems that laddo was indeed thinking that she was his meal ticket, apparently he had suggested moving in but NOT told her that his landlord was ending his tenancy on a section 21 to sell the property. When she started discussing money and his contribution he asked why when I was paying for the kids. So she told him if he was living there he needed to chip in, and that if he moved in she couldn't keep asking for money from me.\n\nSo she's upset and I think that's going to be over, in the meantime he's ranting to anyone that'll listen that I'm the typical evil jealous ex and controlling her with money.

Smell nothing but mutual respect, reasonableness and exemplary co-parenting.\n\nIF the bf is a decent chap, he will\n(1) calm down\n(2) realize that he has no standing to insert his opinion and that he needs to respect and trust your ex’s judgment and her decisions regarding her kids. and\n(3) see how wrong his judgement is.\n\nIf he was counting on that extra money to subsidize his lifestyle, then your ex may want to rethink how great a guy he really is.",

I had my baby shower last weekend and it was a great event, but there was one interaction that I may be the asshole for.  \n\nMy husband showed up for the gift portion.  When opening gifts, one gift was a baby care package and a onesie to the rival college my husband and I went to. It was given to us by a friend who went to said rival college.   My Husband has a pretty deep hatred of the rival school. I follow along with that since fall saturdays at football games is our thing.    \n\nWhen we opened this gift, my husband audibly said \"oh\". I could see the \"what the fuck \" look on his face.   I said, I hope a gift receipt came with this!  I thought it was a gag gift.  My friend says \"oh no gift receipt\".  I was like, oh well, \"Sons Name\" is never going to wear this. Then moved on to the next gift.  Little awkward, but whatever.  After the party, my husband threw the onesie in the trash.  \n\nA few days ago someone asked what happened with the onesie and I told them.  Well that made it around to a few people and I get a text from the friend saying that i'm a huge asshole.  I should have just given it back to her.  I was like thats what the gift receipt comment was for and told her my husband would never allow our son to be dressed like that.  I never thought it was supposed to be a legitimate gift, but apparently it was.  AITA?",

Your posted question is disingenuous.\n\nif you are serious about wanting to know if the consensus here is whether you are (versus defending your actions), here is a rebuttal to your excuses:\n\n1. You asked for a gift receipt, and she said ‘no’.\n\nDo you think you and your husband are the only people who ever got a gift they didn’t particularly want and no gift receipt?\n\nPeople who receive thoughtless or useless gifts quietly donate them. People who receive true gag gifts, usually have a sense of humor about it. Those people use the gag gift to share some laughs with their loved ones. Or if they don’t have a sense of humor, they… donate it.\n\nYes, your friend could have included a gift receipt so that you and your husband could return it and get something else. Maybe you felt she was giving you no gift if you couldn’t replace that onesie with something you liked more.\n\nBut it was not a cruel gift from a toxic person or a repetitive unwanted gift that you are sick of dealing with. You treated your friend and her gift as if they were, when you had better options for your reaction to someone you consider a friend.\n\n2. Your husband is the person with the fierce hatred of the rival. He is the one who threw it in the trash. You just ‘go along.’ Yes, he is co-AH with you. You were rude in your own right and had no problem with his actions, and you are still defending both of you.\n\n3. You ‘told one person in private.’ if you can’t keep this rude behavior secret, why do you expect anyone else to? And honestly, your whole friend group may have been shocked by your rudeness at the shower and this one friend, even more shocked by you calmly sharing that you and your husband threw the gift in the trash. Whether or not that person was an AH for sharing the information, that does not absolve you of your own aholery.\n\n4. The gift giver is supposed to be your friend. If you were offended by the gift, you could have been at least low-key gracious at the shower and then followed up with her to ask if it was meant to be a gag gift. You could have confirmed that neither you nor your husband have a sense of humor and wee truly offended by it (You did indicate that with your rude comment at the shower. She may have meant the gift to be humorous, but even here you are crystal clear that you did not respond with humor.) She might have then responded by agreeing to take back the gift and give you something else.\n\nAt best, this could have been a moment of friendly teasing. It could have at least been a moment of resolving a difference among friends. You and your husband are the ones who turned this into a moment for a rudeness.",

      "scenario_description": "My wife (32f) and I (35m) were recently on vacation over the 4th of July, which also happens to be my wife's birthday. We had all the normal traditions for our family, including cake. We all had a piece day-of but almost nobody ate cake the entire rest of the trip. When the time came to return home, in-laws (MIL made the cake) offered to send the whole thing with us because they \"didn't need all that and we will probably just throw it away.\" My wife hates food waste, so she brought it. The journey home was two days by car. It has since been two additional days since we got back. Each night after dinner, I've had a reasonably sized piece of the cake for desert. I used to be a bigger guy and while I have much better habbits now, I still have a soft spot for baked goods...the cake was \"budgeted for\" though and I had been looking forward to eating a little. Well today my wife saw that there was only one slice left and was irate... Saying I was completely selfish and had eaten almost all of HER cake. I told her the cake had been available to all for nearly a week (counting days it sat on the counter before we took it home with us) and that nobody had bothered to touch it but me. I did apologize after she finished explaining to me that it upset her but I dont understand why it's such a big deal to begin with. The cake was right there...she never even had a bite.\n\nFor additional context, in the past she has requested that certain foods be saved for her as leftovers etc. Ive obliged, only for that food to sit until it had become moldy and she claims she \"forgot it was in there, oops.\" For someone who hates food waste, allegedly, I find this behavior doubly puzzling... Was I wrong here?\n\nEdit to answer some recurring questions:\n\nIt isn't, nor has ever been a \"my cake\" or \"your cake\" situation in our family. Its just THE cake, to be shared. There has never been an expectation beyond making sure the birthday person gets the first slice. After that, its just a regular old cake.\n\nThe courtesy some are relaying is to simply ask if she wanted a slice while im serving myself. In our home, this has never really been a consistent thing. It does happen, but its not an expectation and doesnt happen every time. Desserts are just understood to be periodically available and if you want some, its there. Different rules for small children notwithstanding...\n\nFinally...we ate on the drive. Idk why people exclude those two days from when the cake was available. Obviously we didn't drive 48 hours straight without sustenance... and the first night we obviously had to park and rest somewhere. And besides that we were home for dinner on the second day as well.\n\nUpdate: I have decided to simply bake her the exact same cake, in a smaller tin just for her. It will be her cake and nobody else will touch it. If it gets wasted, so be it. I hate the waste but its not worth the division.\n\nUpdate 2: the remade cake was much appreciated. She has yet to take a single bite. Not going to track progress. The cake was made as an apology, not to test the theory. This is the final update. ",

      "comment_text": "NTA\n\nUnfortunately I do t think appealing to logic is going to work this time with your wife. She is stuck on an emotional reaction to food. And I’m going to guess it is deep, going back to childhood - maybe connected to her mom’s attitude toward food.\n\nKnow for yourself that you are not TA here.\n\nMaybe at a later date you can initiate a more general conversation with your wife:\n\nYou know she hates to waste food, but she also likes to know she has the ability to eat food she considers hers… but she doesn’t always remember it’s there. If you are enjoying something, you don’t mind asking if she’d like some, too (but do not offer or be willing to be responsible for reminding her about food).\n\nWhen the food isn’t getting eaten, would she be happier if you left the food left alone, even if it ends up wasted; or would she be happier if you ate the food so that it didn’t get wasted. Again, you don’t mind offering some to her if she is around when you take some, but you aren’t going to become responsible for reminding her to eat food.\n\nIf it is possible, you may gently bring up the idea of her talking to a counselor about her relationship with food. It’s not a marriage-breaking issue; but she might develop a happier, healthier dynamic around food.\n\nETA\n1. It may help to flip the question around: what would upset her less - the food going to waste or being eaten by you?\n\n2. I forgot about your own history with food. While it seems to me that your wife struggles with the beliefs that wasting/ enjoying food is bad, she may also have an emotional response to any prior history you may have of eating up food before she had a reasonable chance to have some.\n\nHere, you clearly waited a more than reasonable amount of time, but you may ask her how many days she thinks her earmarked food she wants you to consider her food untouchable.\n\nOr if she just has a flashback reaction any time you eat food that she planned on eating… eventually.",

      "scenario_description": "Hey im an old guy who has never posted on reddit, but at the urging of my neice and nephew I'm going to attempt to post this here :)\n\nSo I (50M) have a neice and a nephew who are both 18 and just graduated. A few years ago when they were entering HS I made a deal with them, if they kept a B average their entire time in high school I would buy them any car of their choosing, within reason of course. We added a clause that they got 1 semester forgiven, so they were able to mess up one semester and I wouldn't hold it against them, I felt like 7/8 semesters with a b average was pretty fair. \n\nSo my neice maintained her grades, she did mess up her sophomore year but otherwise was right on track. My nephew on the other hand pretty much never did right, we were lucky that he even passed every semester. I offered help, tutors, books, tried to make sure he was okay mentally, whatever he needed but turns out he just straight up was not doing his work. He was doing good on tests but would never do his actual work resulting in his grades being low. \n\nSo last week was when my neice got her car, she choose a 2025 Toyota camry. My nephew kept asking when he was going to get his, and I told him he didn't stick to his end of the agreement so he did not get a car. He still got a very nice gift back at graduation. Now, him and his mom are angry with me and saying im favoring my neice and now he is refusing to speak to me or his sister. I don't think I messed up but I'm starting to worry, AITA?\n",

      "scenario_description": "My wedding is in two weeks. Earlier today, I got a call from my mom asking if my older brother could attend with his partner’s 7-year-old daughter.\n\nFor context: my fiancée and I sent out save-the-dates 7 months ago, and formal invitations 5 months ago. RSVPs were due 5 weeks before the wedding to allow enough time to finalize headcounts for food, seating, etc.\n\nWhen I spoke with my brother, he originally RSVP’d \"no\" because his first child is due right around the time of our wedding. I told him I completely understood. He mentioned he might be able to make it later in the week, possibly bringing his partner’s 7-year-old with him (they live across the country).\n\nHere’s the issue: our wedding has had a clearly communicated 21+ only policy for nearly a year. We’ve already had tough conversations with family, including my future in-laws, to reinforce that this applies across the board — no kids, no exceptions — even for newborns. My brother already RSVP’d no and now says he can make it.\n\nNow, my mom and sister are pressuring me to \"be more welcoming\" and let my brother bring the child. But my fiancée and I feel like our boundaries aren't being respected on what’s supposed to be our day. We put this rule in place intentionally to give guests an adults-only atmosphere and to avoid exactly this kind of last-minute stress.\n\nTo be fair, I understand how this could seem rigid or even unfair. My brother lives far away, and this might have been a rare chance for him to come — and I get that traveling with a 7-year-old complicates things. Letting them come might feel like a compassionate exception. But if we allow this one child after telling others — including close friends and immediate family — that no children are allowed, it undermines the rule we’ve held everyone to and could cause resentment or confusion.\n\nSo… AITA for sticking to the no-kids rule and saying no to this request?\n\nEdit: Appreciate the feedback. Since my brother is going to lengths to attend we’ll try to figure something out either babysitter at the venue or catch up with them after/day before wedding if possible. We’re trying to maintain the rule while still involving my brother and make sure the children are taken care of. Sounds like his partner has some family coming to help if needed around the house while my brother and niece travel. Sounds like my brothers partner thinks this might be a little break to bond with the baby and allow my brother to visit/niece to meet everyone since we live so far away. We’ll see how the cards fall from here. ",

But the impact on your guests (and you!) after others wanted and didn’t get exceptions of their own is too high a cost.\n\nI do believe your decision is appropriate.

      "scenario_description": "Posting for a friend who wishes to stay anonymous.\n\nHi, my name is Lois. My husband Bryan and I adopted our son James through a private adoption. He’s nine months old now, but at the time of this story, he was six months and had just come home from the ER after a couple of nights due to low oxygen levels (he’s fine now, just has minor non-life-threatening health issues).\nBefore we knew we’d be adopting James, we had a trip to NYC booked for our anniversary. When the time came, I was torn—do we take him or leave him with my mom and sister (both RNs who watch him often)? Ultimately, we decided it was safer and more stable for James to stay with them, where he had doctors familiar with his history. It broke my heart to leave him, but we felt it was best. My best friend Harper, who watches James every other Friday (only twice a month), agreed to help on one of the days we were gone. I was really grateful. Two weeks later was her regularly scheduled Friday. She hadn’t watched James in a while because she’s been backing out a lot last-minute, so my brother-in-law has had to fill in. On this Friday, I mistakenly thought James was with my brother-in-law and not Harper. After work, I stopped by the store when Harper called asking if I was late to pick up James. I was mortified and apologized, saying I was 10 minutes away and had mixed up who had him. She said nothing then, but I didn’t hear from her for weeks. I finally texted asking if we were okay, and she asked me to call her. When I did, she told me I was a bad mom, that I adopted James for the wrong reasons, and said it seemed like I just wanted an accessory, like a pet. I was devastated. We’ve been best friends for 20 years. My husband and I tried to conceive for over five years before turning to adoption. We chose private adoption specifically to avoid agencies that pressure birth moms—we personally knew James’s birth mom and offered her support if she wanted to raise him herself. It was a decision made with love and care. I told Harper her words deeply hurt me and that leaving James behind on the trip and being late to pick him up once didn’t make me a bad mom. But those were the two things she cited. It’s been weeks. She hasn’t apologized, but two days ago she texted asking if I needed her to watch James next Friday. I responded that I’d rather focus on repairing our friendship and that I didn’t want to strain things further by asking her to babysit. I asked where we stood, but she’s since ghosted me. I’ve always supported her through her journey as a young mom without judgment. I’m trying to figure out if I’m in the wrong here, or if it’s time to walk away after 20 years. I’m open to honest feedback.",

I think you are absolutely right that it's best to take out the element of her babysitting your son and figure out what is going on in your relationship with her.\n\nI think you tell her that you don't understand what she's feeling or thinking and would like to because you value her friendship.

      "scenario_description": "This is on a throwaway because this is so niche and dumb that I don’t want it on my main. \n\nI (23F) have been working at a small restaurant with about 35 staff members total for about 2 years now. I get along great with everyone who works there, except for 1 girl, Mara (19F) who started about 3 months ago. \n\nI do not like this girl. I have tried really hard to like this girl. Mara refuses to do the bare minimum parts of her job (ignores tables, won’t do side work, won’t run food, etc), will cry and break down into hysterical sobbing when asked to do her job, or literally have a foot stomping, item slamming tantrums when the sobbing doesn’t work. She will lie and say that she did do her job, and belligerently sob when you catch her in a lie as she isn’t a very good liar and they’re very easy lies to catch if you just go back and check her work. \n\nAll of the trouble she causes ends up COSTING me money because if I work a shift with her, I’m the one waiting her tables, running refills, etc or else the managers will get cross with me for “not putting the customer first.” I’ve done a spreadsheet and I make less tips on nights I work with her because my tables get slightly more neglected when I’m helping her, while she gets to pocket the full tip from what are technically her tables that I waited on. \n\nMy coworkers thought it would be fun to have a “Christmas in July” potluck like we do for the actual day of Christmas in December and Thanksgiving in November. For both of these things, I made a homemade baked Mac and cheese to bring to the potluck both times. I adore cooking, and I adore sharing my food with friends, who I consider many of my coworkers to be. \n\nI wrote down that I’d be bringing food to the potluck, but when they asked me if I’d be participating in “luau Santa” (it’s just secret Santa in July 🙄) I said no, that I don’t really have the money with it being July and all. We’re not a tourist town and we really slow down during the summer, and I still have 2 pets and my little brother to feed while he’s out for the summer. I made excuse after excuse to not sign up for this part. \n\nMy managers kept asking and asking and asking if that was the real reason, until I finally told them that it’s not just that I don’t have the money, it’s that I don’t want to risk getting paired with Mara and having to buy her something, so I won’t sign up at all. I just can’t justify spending money on her in my head when I know that she already costs me money every time I work with her. My managers think I’m the AH for refusing to play, because we need an even amount of people, I told them to stop bothering me about it or I wouldn’t bring anything at all to the potluck. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

They HARASS you to participate in a voluntary, non-work activity and QUESTION the veracity of your word.\n\n3. They don't seem to understand how Secret Santas work. X people sign up and draw a name from a pool of X names. It doesn't matter if X is odd or even because you don't PAIR off the people!!!.\n\n  \nTwo separate issues going on here. I'm not in your shoes, and you are carrying responsibilities on your shoulders... so I only offer suggestions for you to consider:\n\n1. Take care of YOUR tables during your shift. If there is something you can easily do for one of Mara's tables, do it - but don't do anything that takes you away from your tables for several minutes. Instead, you can tell the floor manager, \"*Table X is looking for Mara.*\" If your manager tells you to take care of her customer, reply, \"*I have already helped her, and my customers don't want their service to suffer.*\"\n\nIf you feel you can say more at a time outside actual dinner service, it would be great to tell the general manager, \"*My first responsibility is to serve my customers well, and my second is to support other team members on occasion - when they are learning, have a large group, are having a bad day, etc. It is the managers' responsibility to hire staff who are able and willing to do the job as required, to ensure the staff are properly trained and supervised/instructed/re-trained as needed until they actually fulfill their responsibilities, AND to let go of staff who repeatedly fail to do their jobs. Mara doesn't need an occasional hand of support. She refuses to do tasks she doesn't want to do and fails to fulfill her responsibilities. If management does not address this, customers will continue to be dissatisfied with their service and your good staff will be dissatisfied with the negative impact on them from having to do her work for her.*\"\n\nOP, I know you probably can't say all that. I just wanted to put it all into words just for you to have - if it gives you some moral support, and if you ever can use a bit of it to call your managers out on their failure to address her poor work.\n\n2. As for the potluck/secret santa, I'm already so offended by the managers prodding you about signing up for Santa that I think it would be fine for you to say, \"*I look forward to the potluck. Secret Santas actually work with any number of people, so I'm sure you can figure out how that's done. This is supposed to be a fun, social gathering; so please stop pushing as if it is a requirement. Thank you.*\"",

During the meal, she kept making comments implying that she wanted another cocktail, but wouldn't order it. The waitress even came by and asked if we needed anything, but she didn't order a drink even when we all did. I could tell she was agitated at that point, but it was my birthday so I just ignored her. \n\nWhen we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we \"let\" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying \"no\" to the waitress because her family should've \"taken care of her\" (her words, not mine). \n\nThe three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.

      "scenario_description": "I (23F) live at home with my twin sister (23F) and our mum (52F), who is currently away for two weeks. Our mum has two small dogs, one of whom is unwell and needs to eat regularly, or she gets sick.\n\nFor context, I’m at university and also have a part-time job. My sister starts uni in a couple of months and works a temp job here and there. She’s very organised and she has a calendar on the fridge where we note down any plans. I had written that I’d be working from 10 AM to 6 PM on Saturday and 12 PM to 6 PM on Sunday and also noted that I’d be watching the football with friends on Sunday evening at the pub (I invited her and her boyfriend too).\n\nOn Saturday, she was out all day, and the dogs were alone—it happens sometimes and isn’t usually a huge deal. On Sunday, I walked the dogs before leaving for work. My sister and her boyfriend had already left to go to a local market. Around 2:30 PM, I texted her asking when she’d be home. She replied, saying she wasn’t going home at all.\n\nI reminded her I was working until 6 PM and heading straight to the pub after, so I wouldn’t be home to feed the dogs. She suddenly panicked, saying I never told her I wouldn’t be stopping at home first and that the dogs would be left alone and unfed for 12+ hours.\n\nI told her that my schedule was on the fridge, and it’s not reasonable to expect I’d go all the way home for 10 minutes just to turn around and head back into the city where the pub is—especially since I was already at work in the city. To me, it seemed obvious that I’d go straight from work. She said I was being rude and unhelpful and told me to figure something out.\n\nI told her there was nothing for me to figure out. She had no set plans that day and could’ve easily been home. She asked me to leave work, go home, sit with the dogs for 10 minutes, then head back out. I refused, and she claimed it was my fault for not explicitly telling her I wouldn't be coming home between work and the football. I told her to stop blaming me and to take responsibility, especially since she knew both my work and football plans.\n\nShe called me an asshole (along with a string of other things) and told me I had a bad attitude and that she wouldn’t be engaging with me any more. My mum is now involved and seems to be blaming me too.\n\nSo now, I have to miss the start of the football match with my friends and feed the dogs, and I’m really frustrated. I honestly don’t see how I’m at fault here—but my sister insists I am.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My brother might see and recognize this but it is what is is. \n\n\nMy mom passed away last summer. I (24M) was the only one of my siblings (F, M, M, all a couple of years older) interested in her car, so I handled everything with my sister since she was the authorized representative. I waited through probate, paid the fee, and had it titled, registered, and insured under my name this April. No one had issues at the time. I now drive that car (call it the yellow car).\n\nI’ve also had my own car (the green car) since 2021. Both cars are worth ~$3-4k.\n\nA couple months ago, one of my brothers asked to borrow my green car for the summer. I agreed but told him up front I might try to sell it and would need it back for that. He said fine.\n\nFast forward to early July: a coworker was interested in buying it. On July 9, I texted my brother that a buyer might be coming. No reply. I texted again on the 11th to say I’d need it Monday or Tuesday. Again, no reply.\n\nToday, I texted him I’d come get it, and he blew up—saying the siblings need to be involved because I “got Mom’s car for free” and shouldn’t be selling my own car. He also claimed he didn’t see my texts because he was at a music festival Fri-Sun… but my first texts were from the Tues and Thurs before that, and he still managed to post to Instagram.\n\nHe sent some texts insulting my character, calling me selfish and saying I’d ruin my relationship with him and my sister “over money.” When I pointed out I warned him from the start I might need my car back, he went off with:\n\n“I’m literally offering you money to use your car, can you not read? If you think I’m guilt tripping you then you’re actually [r-word]. You clearly only care about yourself, hope ruining this relationship is worth it. Don’t talk to me ever again.”\n\n(Also—he only mentioned possibly buying when we first talked 7 weeks ago, never responded about it again until today, after he was already insulting me.)\n\nI went and picked up my car from my other brother’s place (where brother in question is staying after quitting his job last year to travel). Found three empty weed pens in it—so apparently he was driving my car high.\n\nNow I’m planning to go low/no contact for a while and not let him borrow anything of mine again.\n\nAITA?",

I didn't want a gender reveal party, but I still wanted to be able to tell everyone on my own terms. \n  She didn't care for my answer and told everyone in our church (we have a VERY small town/community) the gender this morning when I wasn't around.

      "scenario_description": "I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. \n\nIn the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. \n\nI am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. \n\nThey’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. \n\nYesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. \n\nI had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. \n\nMy kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. \n\nBut afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. \n\nSo AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",

And that you need everyone to pick up some additional chores and also take care of something if they see a need.\n\nHowever, the complete lack of ANYONE stepping up even a little - AND then having the gall to complain about things they could take care of but choose to act as if anything not already specifically assigned to them MUST be your responsibility. Well, I can't blame you for blowing your fuse.\n\nI think you can reasonably apologize for not discussing this with them under calmer circumstances, but saying you still need the whole family to problem-solve together and take on more responsibility. In a few years, your teens will have to take care of all their responsibilities solo - while they are in school/work a full-time job - so they might as well get skilled at balancing their time. Then (in this calmer atmosphere) go ahead and ask folks to pick up a few weekly chores AND a few monthly chores.\n\nIt's also a chance for everyone to practice and model looking beyond their personal needs to the bigger needs of the group they are a member of (whether it's family or work...).",

      "scenario_description": "I (24F) have been living with my roommate, Sarah (26F), for about a year. We generally get along, but lately, there’s been tension over her borrowing habits, and I need some perspective on whether I overreacted. Now here’s an interesting problem, I own a car, and Sarah doesn’t. I’m happy to help out occasionally, like driving her to the grocery store or giving her a lift to work if her ride falls through. I’ve always made it clear, though, that I need advance notice and that my car isn’t a free for all. It’s not just about gas or wear and tear, it’s my only way to get to my job (I’m a nurse with odd shifts), and I can’t risk it being unavailable or damaged.\nAbout three months ago, Sarah started asking to borrow my car more frequently which sometimes for small things like grabbing takeout or visiting friends. I let her borrow it a couple of times after she promised to be careful, but I noticed she wasn’t great about refilling the gas or cleaning up like leaving coffee cups or muddy footprints. I gently reminded her to respect my car, and she apologized, so I let it slide. Last month, things escalated. Sarah asked to borrow my car for a quick errand as usual but kept it for six hours without texting me. I had to cancel plans because I couldn’t get to them, and when she returned, the gas tank was nearly empty. I was frustrated and told her I wasn’t comfortable lending it out anymore unless it was an emergency. She got defensive, saying I was being petty and that roommates should share resources. I explained that my car isn’t a shared resource and this is my personal property, and I need it for work. She rolled her eyes but seemed to drop it. Last week, Sarah asked to borrow my car again to visit her sister, who lives an hour away. I said no, citing the previous issues and my upcoming 12 hour shift. She got upset, saying her sister was having a rough time and she really needed to see her. I felt bad, so I offered to drive her there myself on my day off, but she said that wasn’t convenient for her schedule. She then accused me of being selfish and said I was holding my car over her head to control her. I stood my ground and said I wasn’t comfortable lending it out after she disregarded my boundaries before.\nSince then, Sarah’s been cold, barely speaking to me, and she told a mutual friend I’m being unreasonable and unsupportive. Our friend thinks I should’ve just let her borrow the car since her sister’s situation sounds serious, but I feel like Sarah’s not respecting my needs or my property. I get that she’s stressed, and I don’t want to seem heartless, but I also don’t think I’m obligated to let her use my car, especially after she’s been careless.\n\nAITA for refusing to lend her my car? I want to be a good roommate, but I feel like my boundaries are being ignored.",

Nor does she appreciate your generosity to date. She has made it abundantly clear:\n\nEye rolling, accusing you of being petty, and her dismissiveness.\n\nHer initial niceness was to get you to say yes. Now she can’t even bother to pretend to respect your property/time/money or appreciate it as a favor - that’s how entitled she feels.\n\nHer needs and wants are not your concern or your responsibility to satisfy.\n\nBased on her attitude - especially her not keeping her word and keeping the car for hours extra AND her response afterward - you shouldn’t allow her use of your car ever again. I’d even be uninclined to do favors.\n\nTell her she enjoyed your goodwill and generosity and abused it. That is now over. She can figure out other ways to get where she wants to go.",

      "scenario_description": "My son has just had his 2nd birthday and we had a party for his friends from playgroup, my neighbour messaged me after the party saying 'the cherry on the cake' to all the shit going on in her life was that I didn't invite her autistic 8 year old son to his toddler party. \n\nShe's made me feel really guilty like I'm the reason for her upset.\n\nHer son is non verbal and smacks himself in the face if over stimulated. I didn't invite as it was a toddler party with only 5 2-3 year olds. \n\nMy living room isn't very big and I know her son is sensitive to loud noises and thought with all the screaming and fighting it wouldn't be a good idea. He also has to blow out candles even if its not his birthday, which, in my opinion isn't fair and would take focus off my boy.\n\nHe doesn't share toys and, in previous experiences, not even let my son play with his own toys in his own home, and even though the other children were fighting over toys, the parents, including mysel, were stopping snatching and inforcing sharing, even if it caused a tantrum.\n\nI am getting mixed reviews from people around me and I still personally didn't think it would be a good idea but she's made me feel like I was wrong for it.\n\nThank you for all or insights.. \n\nUpdate:-\nSince the party we had a little get together and the 2 toddlers were fighting and screaming about sharing his new toys, constantly trying to stop arguments and the neighbours son came along aswell, when ever the screaming started, it was as I feared the loud noises were too much, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere for the neighbours boy, covering his ears,  sprinting out into the communal gardens, as if he was trying to escape. It started off quietly, but then, as the toddlers got tired, it leveled up gradually. \n",

      "comment_text": "NTA. Pure and simple.\n\nNo question; no ‘on the other hand…’\n\nHeck, the answer would be the same even if you had never even thought about the neighbor’s child.\n\n1 why would anyone assume you would include an 8yo in a party for a few 2 yos?\n\n2. Even if her son were 2 yo, you are having a small party, and her son isn’t in the top 5 closest friends. He doesn’t get invited, and it is perfectly normal.\n\nOur old next door neighbor had two girls the same age as mine. The older two were close friends and always attended\nEach other’s parties (still do, in their twenties). The younger attended each others parties for a few years, but they never became friends and stopped including each other in elementary school. There was no obligation just because we lived next door to each other.\n\n3. Your neighbor was quite rude in her call. I can understand that she may be desperate for her son to feel included and frustrated at the challenge of trying to make that happen. You can choose to be gracious and not make a big deal about her rudeness, but make no mistake. She was rude.\n\n4. Based on what you know of the child, it does definitely seem to have been very wise to not have him over. Your neighbor seems to be so focused on wanting her child included that she is forgetting having him at a noisy crowded party would probably be very upsetting to him.\n\nYour friends who think you should have included the child may want to try inviting him to their house. Not even for their child’s birthday party; just an afternoon play date.\n\nI don’t know how friendly you are in general with this neighbor or how entitled/rude she may generally be to you. You can simply ignore her comments and be at peace with your decision. If you have more of a relationship, you may try having a calm conversation with her at a later date. You can be clear that your two sons are not the same age. You are sympathetic to her challenges and would happily look for appropriate moments to share - maybe popsicles in the front yard one sunny day; but your son cannot be her son’s de facto friend simply because you two are neighbors.",

      "scenario_description": "So, I (30M) have been dating my girlfriend (27F) for 2.5 years. We’ve talked about marriage for a while, and a few months ago, we even went to a jeweler together to design her dream ring. She was really excited, and I knew how much the surprise element of the proposal meant to her—she’s mentioned how important the surprise was since we started ring shopping and that it has been a childhood dream for her. \n\nA few days ago, her car needed maintenance, so I offered to take it to the dealership for her. They told me it would take about 1.5–2 hours, and I realized this was the perfect opportunity to go pick up the ring, which had just been finished.\n\nI didn’t want to ruin the surprise, so I tried to be sneaky. I turned off my location services (or at least I thought I did), called an Uber, and headed to the jeweler. It took about 45 minutes total. I picked up the ring—and for what it’s worth, I went WAY over budget to make sure it was exactly what she wanted—and then turned my phone service back on.\n\nThat’s when I saw several missed messages from her.\n\nTurns out, I didn’t fully disable my location and she had checked it when I wasn’t answering her texts. She saw I was at the jewelry store and put two and two together. She confronted me immediately. I tried to cover it by saying I was still shopping around and negotiating prices at different jewelers.\n\nShe didn’t buy it.\n\nI eventually came clean and told her the truth—that I had gone to pick up the ring. She flipped. She got really upset and said I “ruined” the entire proposal ( I have yet to propose). She said it felt like I didn’t care about her dream and that I was selfish for not trying harder to keep it a surprise. At one point, she even demanded I buy her a new ring\n\nNow, I already felt awful. I knew how important the surprise was to her, and my stomach dropped when I saw those texts saying she knew where I was. But I never expected her to react with that much anger. She’s said some things that really hurt—like that I ruined the moment on purpose, and that I don’t listen or care about her feelings. I listened, apologize profusely, and tried hard to convince her to look at the bigger picture of our future. She didn’t appear to care about that or my feelings on the matter as this would have been a special moment for me as well. \n\nI just wanted to surprise her with the ring she designed herself, and now I feel like I can’t win. She keeps asking “how are you going to fix this?” \n\nI need help, what do I do. AITA for accidentally ruining the proposal surprise?",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for lying to my parents (M&F 50s) about how much money I (F23) make so I don't have to pay them as much for rent?\n\nTo give context after college I moved back into my parents and have been here for 8 months. Since graduating college my parents have taken a sum of my income starting at 20%. After a couples months I was expected to pay the Parent Plus Loan ($510 monthly). A couple more months my car payment was added ($300 monthly). All of this I think is fair and I have no issue with except for the fact I had to quit my job in March.\n\nI was expecting to live in the college area after I graduated but due to outside circumstances I could not get a place. This led to me living home and having a 2 hour commute. After a few months I had to toss in the towel and quit because it was nearly costing money to have the job. During this time my parents had slowly increased my rent to 40% of my income for more expenses. When I was unemployed my parents instead took $200 as well as the loan money (car money was added once I got a new job). This absolutely destroyed my savings to the point I've gained thousands in credit card debt to keep up with life and expenses needed to apply for jobs.\n\nEventually I got a job! This is where I may be an AH but I lied to my parents and hide 40% of my income in an account they can't see. If they question why there's a lack of money I may say I had 20-30% automatically put in savings. I just need to leave this living situation. It's a family of 5 with 2.5 bath, living with family 24/7, limited freedoms, but most importantly feeling a crushing sensation of being trapped here. I understand that my parents have had lives that made them not great with money and there are debts to be paid. In reality paying for loans and my car payment isn't horrible and I expect it. I just keep doing math and see how if I lived with someone I could have a 2 bed 1 bath for the same price. The rent they also say goes to food and electricity (we don't pay for water), so that makes sense a bit. Am I being an AH for hiding the full amount I earn so I can save up to move out?\n\nEDIT: Just adding extra information to clear up some common questions.\n* The total monthly payment is $750 (rent) + $300 (car) + $510 (PPL)\n* I asked for an itemized list of the 40% but I was told it wasn't needed and they said it's what they felt was right.\n* With that I can only assume basic rent, electric, food, and some smaller stuff.\n* I pay for 1/3 of my meals by myself, I pay for my own gas, and car maintenance.\n\nI also can't move out right now due to having very little savings.",

      "scenario_description": "I am 63 years old. I am moving to a different state to improve my income and better my health. I have asked my brother and sister to help care for my elderly mom who is 83 and lives in my home. She does not want to move.  My monthly living expenses, not including personal debt other than the mortgage is $3,485.00. My mother contributes $1,000 per month. I have a brother who is living in another state and a sister who lives here in town. The are both younger than me and have smaller incomes. My mom refuses to ask either of them for help. I took my mom in 3 years ago because she was living alone in an apartment where the temperature averaged 96 deg all the time. She no longer has a car and is on oxygen. My sister claimed she was taking care of mom with once or twice weekly visits of about 30-45 mins at a time. She did not contribute financially to Mom's expenses. My brother has never contributed to help Mom with her expenses. Now that I am disabled and retired, my monthly income is no longer growing and I often end up hemorrhaging money each month to keep things going as they are. I also have two adult children who are disabled and I try to help them out. AITA for getting a little resentful that Mom won't ask my brother or sister for help and that they think that I am responsible because I tried to get Mom out of an unhealthy environment. They say that I signed up for this and are completely willing to let me bear the burden for my mom's care.",

Completely understandable.\n\nBut you are also \"spitting into the wind\" if you focus on what you want others to do when they are clear they will not do that. It gets you absolutely nothing useful.\n\nYour mom not asking your siblings for help is a moot point; you have asked and they've declined. Take your brother and sister at their word because counting on them to do what you want is sure to result in them not living up to expectations, more frustration, and possibly you feeling you have to scramble even more to \"save\" your mom.\n\nInstead, focus first on what help you can reasonably and prudently offer your mom - nothing that is more of a sacrifice than you can or want to make. You may need to do some research into local options for your mom. It can be very hard for an older person to leave behind the environment they know. If you can find viable local options, that's great. If not, then you at least know you tried and there are no options.\n\nThen - just like parents do with their kids - you can present your mom with X options to choose from. The options may only be (1) moving and staying with you or (2) moving into a local elder care facility that is what she can afford on the income/benefits available to her. A third option may be to ask her to move with you and give it a 6 months. If she wants to return to her hometown after that, you may help her do that. (Although moving twice wouldn't be great, it, the option of testing the waters may be good for both of you.)\n\nDon't waste your own time or energy on wishing for things your brother and sister are not going to give.\n\nNTA",

      "scenario_description": "I (18M) threw a birthday party for myself at our local mall with my close friend group (4 girls, all 17F, and one guy, 17M). We’re all in the same class and pretty close, so I only invited them.\nThere’s a classmate of ours, “Bob” (17M), who I’m not comfortable around because of things he’s done in the past. My friends know this. Despite everything, I’ve actually tried a few times to be friendly toward him, but it never worked.\nAt the party, we were sitting at a café when Bob suddenly showed up, pulled up a chair, and sat with us without asking. I was surprised and uncomfortable, but before I could say anything, one of the girls told me not to say anything because Bob would get sad. She said I should think about how I’d feel in his position and that he wouldn’t stay long.\n\nI told her it’s my birthday and I should get to decide who’s there. She said that didn’t justify treating someone badly and that since Bob is our classmate, we “owe it to him” to include him and that i should just get over it. I told her that if she cared so much, she could leave with him when I asked him to go. She got upset and said I should just wait it out.\nSo I waited — for about 40 minutes. The whole time, I was really uncomfortable while everyone chatted with Bob like he was invited. When we got up to leave the café, Bob followed us. I was about to ask him to leave when the same girl said that if I did, it would look like all of us wanted him gone.\n\nAt that point, my male friend asked if I wanted to hang out just the two of us, and I said yes ( he also didn't like the guy ) . So we quickly left together by just telling them that we had to leave. About 30 minutes later, the others called us, really angry that Bob realized what happened and that they had to “explain themselves.” They said I was an ass for abandoning them.\nI told them it was weird how they suddenly acted like Bob's friends even though none of them ever talked to him before — I was the only one who ever tried. They cared more about how they looked to him than about how I felt on my own birthday, or atleast what it felt like.\n\nLater, they texted me saying I was wrong for excluding a classmate and that I needed to accept him. They said I’ll have to work with people I don’t like in the future and asked me to think about how I’d feel in his shoes. I haven’t replied since then. Honestly they treat me in general really good they ask me to hang out with them ,even though they don't talk to me much there but it's normal since they are closer to each other than with me.\nSo, AITA? \n\n\nEdit: For clarification — when Bob first showed up, I whispered to the girl next to me (we were sitting at a -not too large but not small either' table, and Bob was on the opposite side) that I was going to ask him to leave. She immediately pushed back. I was trying to be quiet but not too quiet because I kinda wanted him to get that we were talking about him but not exactly hear what we were saying, in hope he understood that he wasn't welcomed.",

Both of these events require travel. During the initial planning stages of the baby shower, my family was scheduled to help my mom prepare the food and decorations and obviously attend the celebration. I was always supposed to travel in a few days before everyone to help with preparations and spend time with my parents, brother and his wife as they also live out of state. When we got the news of the service times for our friend, I let my mom know that it was the same day as the shower and we wouldn’t be able to make it. My husband is giving the eulogy. But that I still wanted to come the week before and help her and spend time with them but would leave early so we could attend the funeral. She is mad at me. Told me not to come. That hardly no one was going to be at the baby shower and she’s hurt this was my choice. I spoke to my brother and told him of the situation he said I was making the right decision by going to the funeral. According to my mom, that was just lip service as “what was he supposed to say? The choice was already made.”. And they are all so hurt that we won’t be there. She won’t pick up the phone when I call and I got these details via a few short texts. AITA?",

You can express your understanding of her feelings with something like, “It’s disappointing that we won’t all be together to celebrate.” But it is not your job to manage your mom‘s feelings.\n\nYou and your family need to pay your respects to this close friend; you want to be there to support your husband and any other close loved ones of the deceased. This is the time for that.\n\nThere will be plenty of opportunities in the future to support and celebrate your brother, his wife and their new baby.",

      "scenario_description": "My (30s M) friend (30s M) and I planned a beach trip to Florida about two months ago. It's a 3.5-hour drive, and we booked an Airbnb together. The plan was for a relaxed \"boys trip\" getaway.\n\nAbout a month ago, he casually mentioned that his ex-girlfriend (who he broke up with about 3 months ago) would coincidentally be in the same beach town that weekend. We both joked about it, referencing \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" and imagining awkward waves if we even saw them. I definitely got the impression that we weren't planning on interacting with her.\n\nFast forward to this past Sunday (five days before the trip, which starts Friday night). He tells me he's now planning to go out to dinner with his ex-girlfriend and her family on Saturday night. This is a big deal because we're arriving Friday at 9:30 PM, so Saturday is our only full night on the trip.\n\nHe asked if I wanted to come along to this dinner. I was pretty taken aback. I told him I thought this was supposed to be a boys trip for us, and I wasn't cool with being essentially ditched for our main night there. I then said that if his priority was seeing his ex, then I didn't really want to go on the trip anymore.\n\nHe immediately got confrontational, accusing me of \"blowing up the trip\" and \"making a huge deal out of nothing.\"\n\nTo me, this feels like he's clearly choosing his ex-girlfriend over our planned time, especially since this trip was specifically for us to hang out. I considered us best friends.\n\nAITA for considering backing out of the trip because he wants to spend our only full night with his ex-girlfriend and her family?",

      "scenario_description": "So my (27f) sister Alex (28f) just finalized her divorce and got engaged 3 days later to a guy (24m) she has been seeing for about a year. There was definitely some overlap and this post isn't inherently about that drama, but it is probably affecting my judgement.\n\nAnyway, the day after her announced engagement, Alex messages a group chat with my mom in it and says that she really wants a wedding on a Disney cruise. She send screenshots of the wedding package and some of the dates. My mom and I responded that a 7-day cruise is too long and expensive so she responds with a screenshot of a 5-day cruise with no pricing in the pic. At this point, I am not too excited to see that she wants a cruise wedding, but I didn't say anything negative yet, as I was going to see her that weekend and hopefully bring it up gently then.\n\nThe following days are a follow ups of venue options on and off the boat and the itinerary, until on Friday, she sends a video invitation to the group chat. I ask if that is the final invitation. Alex responds that it is, she was sending it to friends and family already. I figure this is the time to drop the bomb that this is a very expensive wedding for her guests. She responds that its okay, she only wants a small wedding and that people can pay it off in installments. I say \"what about everyone who already has booked vacations, can't take more time off?\" She assures me that 9 months in plenty of time. My mom chimes in that there is no way our elderly grandparents would be able to come as 1 of them is already wheelchair bound. She says that's fine too.\n\nI started to make some suggestions: a small family dinner before the cruise in our home state PA/NJ (cruise takes off from FL), a FL Disney resort wedding before the cruise, a Bahamas Disney resort wedding that we can meet her there, and pushing the date to something later/cheaper. She says this is what she wants, she already booked it, and she apparently has been talking about this with fiance for a while.\n\nSo I made a spreadsheet including the cruise tickets, gratuity, flights, a hotel, transport, and dog sitting prices and it would cost me and my husband around $6000 to attend this wedding. We already had 1 booked vacation before Alex's date and another for a couple months after the date so we would be stretched thin money-wise. It's unlikely my husband has enough vacation days so he would be losing a few days of pay as well. I tell her all these things that would possibly prevent me from going, she says \"If you don’t wanna go I get it\".\n\nAlex talked it up during that weekend we saw each other: it would be fun and like a family vacation. She wasn't going to expect gifts, bachelorette party, mandatory activities on the boat, etc. I just think that she really rushed into choosing the wedding right after getting engaged and didn't care about what I had to say about the matter. My mom has the same concerns, but is going to go regardless of the cost bcs it is her daughter.\n\nWIBTA if I didn't go to my sisters cruise wedding? Even if it was financially possible for me to go?\n\n  \nEDIT: for all the comments that say \"why should she care about your opinion?\": I'm her only sibling and not including this past year, we were quite close, even sharing a room from ages 6-16. I'm not some random cousin or a college friend offering my unsolicited opinion, she shared her 'planning' with me (though I didn't realize it at the time). If she had just sent me the invitation and said it was a done deal, this post wouldn't be here.",

It is not feasible for you and your husband to attend. You tell sister, and she's OK. She says that she \"gets it\".\n\nNow if your sister doesn't mean that and will give you grief for not going, that would be on her. But that hasn't happened yet.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your mom is giving you grief - she has the same concerns on behalf of your grandparents.\n\nYou don't sound enthused about her quick marriage after divorce, so it's hard to imagine you are too upset over not being able to attend.\n\nAre you hurt that your sister is so easily OK with you not attending? Or do you think your sister is an AH for planning a wedding that you and some other family members cannot easily attend?\n\nJust trying to figure out why you feel this is an AH question. So far, it seems like this is NAH.",

      "scenario_description": "I am a camp counselor (25M) who works with elementary aged boys. To give some context, I am incredibly short and fat. Like, I am under 5 feet tall and around 200 pounds. This does not affect my ability to do my job. I'm just as active as any other counselor, I work with the kids just as much.I have to get blood tests done regularly for unrelated reasons (related to why I'm so short) and there's never really any concern when it comes to my cholesterol or insulin or anything weight related. I'm just saying this so you have some context for my general appearance and the fact that no, my weight doesn't affect my health or my level of activity.\n\nMy co-counselor is a guy around my age who is (I think) a baseball player. We could not look more different. He's got more than a foot of height on me and probably about the same weight, so he's obviously more visibly fit. He brags a lot about how even after we spend all day chasing kids in the sun, he still goes to the gym for a couple of hours. \n\nThe issue is when it comes to actually having to use strength practically, I out do him every time. I'm not trying to do it intentionally. But when we have to carry 20 kids backpacks and he can only handle 8 while I have 12, or when he can't open a jar, or when we have to lug heavy equipment and he's huffing and puffing while I'm not having a problem, it becomes pretty evident that I am just stronger than him, at least for stuff like that. I'm sure he could out bench me or whatever proper fitness stuff is, and trust me he crushes me when we play sports with the kids, I'm just talking about that kind of work.\n\nThe issue is that the kids have started to pick up on the fact that I am the \"strong counselor\". If they want to be picked up or can't open something in their lunch or want a break from carrying their bag on a hike, they come to me. Apparently, my co-counselor complained to one of the other counselors that I am \"embarrassing\" him because a guy like me shouldn't be able to be stronger than him. That counselor then came to me and told me I should tone it done because it can be hard for someone who prides themself on being an athlete to be worse at something than a guy \"like me\". I said there was no way I was going to do my job worse just to protect hit ego, and the other counselor said I was being a jerk and as the summer goes on the boys might start bullying my co-counselor if they think he's weaker than me, which I don't think is going to happen but I'm not sure. \n\nAITA for not wanting to stop doing my job the way I'm doing it so that I don't hurt this guys feelings?",

      "scenario_description": "TLDR: SIL didn't want to go to my husband's birthday party and is now expecting us to plan another since she can't afford to host another one herself. WIBTA for saying no?\n\nHis birthday was last month. His family is obsessed with celebrating birthdays, even though we are all 30yo+. That's fine, but you can understand how hard it is to get 10+ family and friends together for every single birthday when everyone is working different schedules.\n\nWhen his birthday was approaching, I had heard nothing about plans but knew his sister had bought him tons of gifts, so I stepped up and sent out an invite for something my husband wanted to do - a barbecue at the beach. Free, relaxing, and a chance to enjoy the beautiful weather. \n\nHis sister responded, disappointed, that she and her family would actually prefer dinner at a restaurant because they want to be indoors/in the AC. My first thoughts were that, if you are invited to an event that you can't or don't want to attend for some reason, asking the host to cancel or change those plans entirely is quite rude. \n\nIn an effort to stand our ground, we let them know we were going ahead with the barbecue, but if they wanted to plan a separate birthday dinner, they were welcome to. \n\nSo, SIL chooses this upcoming weekend for a family-feast-style dinner at a nearby restaurant. Neat! We adjust our schedules to accomodate. As the day approaches, husband reaches out to sister to ask what the plans are. Turns out, she has nothing planned - hasn't invited anyone else, hasn't made reservations, and hasn't looked at the menu to calculate the cost breakdown. \n\nThe family meals at the restaurant come to $120 each, feeding 4 people. That would feed SIL's family alone. With the rest of us added, we would need at least 2 meals to feed everyone. When we talked all this over with SIL, she realized that the cost splitting would still be over $30pp. That's when she admitted that they just paid their bills and can't afford it.\n\nNo worries. Sorry it didn't work out!\n\nNope. She's now asking *us* to plan something else, something that's less expensive, because she's out of ideas. \"Can we have the party at your place?\" Why, so I get to buy all the food and stress about prepping the apartment to host on short notice? \"Wish we could, but our house is a mess while we're reorganizing\". She is currently waiting for us to think of something else.\n\nConsidering: 1) we already hosted a birthday party that she didn't want to go to, 2) her poor planning would have ended with us footing a $200+ bill, and 3) the series of inconsiderate requests, my husband and I are ready to cancel. Knowing this would break her heart, WIBTA?",

      "scenario_description": "I have a 4 year old son with special needs and I am a single parent so day to day life can be overwhelming sometimes.  My mom always wanted to go on a cruise so last year I saved to treat her, my son, and I to go on a 7 day cruise for her 70th birthday.  I paid for everything except her passport and airline ticket (hotel, cruise fare, excursions, all of her purchases, tips, gratuities, transportation to port).  For the three of us, it was close to $8,000. We went over Christmas break and were in an ocean balcony. \n\n While I had fun, we always had to do what she wanted since it was \"her cruise\" so I missed out on a lot.  She spent most of the time eating (and complaining about the lack of her favorite foods) and how boring everything was (she never wanted to leave the room).  If I booked anything, she would wait to the last minute to decide not to do it so I lost money.    At the end of the cruise, she commented that we should do an entire family cruise this year.  I told her that my son and I would be taking a vacation by ourselves this year.  I was planning Disney but my son is still afraid of the characters so I decided to do another cruise.  \n\nI found one that was 8 days and would only cost my son and I $3100 plus airfare (we are going over Christmas break).  I put down the deposit but haven't finished paying it off.  \n\nLast night, she asked me who my travel agent was because she wanted to take a trip.  I asked where she wanted to go and she mentioned the 4 stops my son and I will be going on (we had talked about it back in January as a large family trip).   She said she wanted to come along with my cousin.  My cousin is not someone I want my son around.  I really don't want them to come because I really want to enjoy my vacation and get to experience everything my son and I want to do.  \n\nWIBTA if I told her I don't want her and my cousin to come along because I want to enjoy my trip.

      "scenario_description": "I (32F) currently live with my husband (37M) in a two floor house in the suburbs that is big enough for both of us and also to house lots of guests if needed. \n\nSeven years ago, when I was 25, I lost my one and only soulmate; my bestfriend. She was my world and my rock and everything made sense around her. I could talk about her all day but that would take too long to write down and I would probably break down in tears anyway;) \nAfter she passed away due to a horrible freak accident, I fell into a depression that led to me drinking away my feelings. This completely altered my life for the worse, I lost my apartment, my friends, my family and my life. I had absolutely no one and my parents were so ashamed of me that they refused to let me live with them. And my sister? She claimed she was living in an apartment that was way too small and that she couldn’t house me. I ended up being hopeless and desperate for a long long time. \n\nSix years and a million AA meetings later, I am now fully sober with a kid on the way:) I never kept contact with my family after what happened, instead I focused on myself and met the love of my life. \nFast forward to a month ago, my sister found my new number via an old friend and contacted me asking if she could stay at my house for awhile. She had lost her job and had been through a tough divorce and lost her house aswell (she had apparently sold the house my parents bought her to live with her partner and later lost the house due to the divorce). Obviously I refused, reminding her of how she treated me in the past.\n\nLast week, my parents& my sister somehow found my address and came to my house demanding to let my sister stay here. \nMy sister defended her past actions by revealing that she found out she was pregnant after my bestfriend passed away but never wanted to tell me due to the fact that I was grieving. She also didn’t want me to stay at her place because she was scared that I would somehow push her into also being an alcoholic and harm her kid. She said that her situation is different now because she already has kids, that her ex-husband has custody of, and that she wants to get her life together and needs my help. After a long discussion things were getting heated and I had to call the police. I am now thinking of filing a restraining order against them but my husband is telling me to “let my rage go” and help my family. I honestly don’t know what to do, I already feel super stressed whilst pregnant and have hormones jumping out of my ears, so that may also be the reason for me being extra angry. I need someones opinion on this situation who doesn’t know me, and I’m hoping for some advice!!\n\nPS: sorry for the super long post, and I also apologise for my english- I am not a native speaker!",

Right now, you need to make sure you and the baby you are carrying feel safe, secure, and emotionally and physically healthy. So don't think twice right now, and tell your husband that he needs to focus on making sure your needs are met as you carry the baby. Your home should always be your sanctuary; that is especially true now. Any other considerations can wait.\n\n  \n\n\nFor the longer-term view (if you do ever want to revisit this/ discuss perspectives with your husband)...\n\nConsider:\n\n1. Did your parents or sister offer ANY form of support (separate from them refusing to let you live with them); did they check in on you? buy you a meal or some groceries? Did they try to call or see you periodically?\n\n2. Did they try to rebuild the relationship as your life improved? Did they care to connect with you with only that as their only goal - no other agenda (like wanting you to do something for sister/them)?\n\nSo far, I'm guessing that their sole focus has been on getting you to help your sister, not on re-building a loving relationship.\n\n3. Suppose you do eventually decide you want some connection to them. The start of any re-building a relationship should NOT be you helping them out. It should be small and not transactional at all. It should only go as far as everyone is comfortable with. IF, IF, IF you ever feel that way, that needs to be clear to your husband and them.",
