      "post_title": "AITA for Adjusting my In-Laws Thermostat while Dog Sitting?",
      "scenario_description": "Never thought I would be posting here, but I need some help on how much I should dig in here…\n\nMy in-laws, who live about a 30 minute drive away, left for a 3 week vacation and asked us to watch their 2 dogs (one of which is older and needs special diet/meds/attention). My wife and I have 3 dogs of our own and a smaller house and yard, so the wife and their parents decided on house sitting while they were gone and just relocating to the in-laws place as the better choice for all logistics.\n\nWe moved a ton of stuff over, my wife is 6 months pregnant and we have a 2-year-old, so staying for a few weeks involved more than just a small bag as you can imagine. I even decided to breakdown my home office and move equipment so I would be here for the remote work hours with the dogs. Been going well, lots of furries running round the yard, getting all the pets and treats they could want.\n\nThe conflict. They (father-in-law) has a smart thermostat for the HVAC/AirCon. It is set with a predetermined automatic schedule. During the day he has it programmed set at 77F/25C. We are a little warmer than preferred during the day, we have popped it down a few times to 74F/23C to take the edge off, but have left it alone.\n\nAt night, the program on the thermostat is set to 80F/26C!!! Thermometer in the bedrooms shows actual temperatures to be about 78F/25.5C.\n\nAfter laying down on the first night for a bit and both myself and my pregnant wife uncomfortable and having trouble falling asleep with it being warmer than how we sleep at our house, I did a manual adjustment down to 74F/23C. I continued and made a manual adjustment down to this temperature each night. I have adjusted it now for a week  down to this lower temperature just so my family could be more comfortable and get a better nights sleep.\n\nFather-in-Law texted this morning upset. Saying to leave it alone, he received an energy and usage report that there has been an increase in the last week, and that we can sleep in the basement at night (no bed in basement and 6-month pregnant wife).\n\nI responded that they should call us later today and we could discuss further, but the plan was to reimburse them the energy cost difference for while we were staying here. I didn’t tell him this, but I plugged in house size, current energy prices, and HVAC unit into ChatGPT to estimate energy cost difference and AI said maybe a $30 - $40 cost difference for the little lower temperature at night for the three weeks. I don’t know how accurate this estimate is, but I would gladly pay $100+ if it meant my wife could sleep in a bed at a reasonable temperature and have no more argument on the subject.\n\nJudge me Reddit, be brutal, any feedback to help me decide how much push-back to give. AITA for adjusting my father-in-laws thermostat?\n\nEdit for detail: The in-laws 3 week vacation is a river cruise in Europe, so trying to just handle most things rather than bug them with too many texts while they are abroad.\n\nEdit 2: Just heard back from them after I offered to pay. He said “it’s potential damage to the hvac system with multiple temperature changes daily.  Energy cost is secondary.”  Lowering the HVAC temperature once at bedtime to 74 degrees, does that really run a risk of damage? (US Central Air, Lennox Compressor from 2022)\n\nEdit 3: They ended up calling as I asked, though begrudgingly as he said he didn’t know what needed to be talked about when I kept asking we all talk. One of my texts in the back-and-forth was that the unnecessary conflict was stressing out the pregnant wife and that realigned them a bit. I was in the shower with the call timing sadly, but he is going to remotely reprogram it to schedule night temps down to 75. In hindsight, how in the world did this devolve into conflict!?! I appreciate all the genuine feedback and responses so I had an understanding how firm I need to be with the situation.",

      "scenario_description": "ETA: this was Sunday night. We stayed Saturday-Monday (today). Four hours from my parent’s house. No other rooms were available. It was NOT a party, this was a weekend fishing trip. \n\nI (28F) and my husband (28M) are on vacation visiting my parents out of state with our 1.5 year old son. It is his first big trip with a long plane ride, time difference, and unfamiliar surroundings. Adjusting has been hard, but he is doing his best. I am also early pregnant with our second child.\n\nI try hard not to let my child be an inconvenience to others or expect people to adjust their lives around him. That is especially difficult when we are not home, where he has his toys, snacks, food, and familiar routine. He thrives on structure, and so do I.\n\nThis weekend, we stayed at a friend of my parents’ for some outdoor activities. There were nine adults total and just one toddler, mine.\n\nAt 8:45 p.m., I laid my son down in a pack and play in our room. He fussed a little, so after five minutes I went back to soothe him. By 9 p.m., he was quiet. The room was dark and his sound machine was on.\n\nThis family eats late, and while setting the table, someone began clattering silverware loudly on the countertops. The room we were staying in was directly above the kitchen, which has an open balcony-style ceiling. My son woke up crying around 9:30. I went back upstairs to soothe him.\n\nWhile I was rocking him, someone started playing 80s music downstairs. At first I did not think much of it, but the volume was turned up, and a group of women including my mother started singing and laughing loudly. I texted my husband asking if he could have them turn the music down. He replied, “He is going to be fine.” I said he was not falling asleep and that I was the one in the room. He said, “It is not that loud.”\n\nI cracked the door and realized the speaker was directly below our room. I waited for the song to end so I could lay him down in a quiet moment, but they restarted the same song at full volume and continued singing. I waited for another pause, laid my son down awake, and went downstairs. I calmly said I was turning the music down because it was directly under our room and keeping him from sleeping. Some adults agreed, but others made comments about me ruining the mood. I should add the speaker had been set to maximum volume.\n\nFeeling emotional and frustrated, I gave my husband the monitor and went quietly to the basement to calm down and cry without making a scene. He came down 15 to 20 minutes later and told me I was overreacting. He said our son has slept through louder noises and that I was being unreasonable. I reminded him there is a difference between sleeping through something and trying to fall asleep with it. He dismissed me, said I was not going to change his mind, and left.\n\n5-10 minutes later I came upstairs. One of the homeowners apologized for waking my son, which I appreciated. But the others, many of whom were drunk, made exaggerated jokes about whispering so they would not wake the baby. At that point I decided not to eat and went to bed around 10:15.",

Given that the homeowner was fine with it and willing to accommodate, I don’t think you were way out of line, though it probably would have been better to ask them to turn down the music (or move the speaker so it wasn’t under your son) rather than doing it yourself. One night of disrupted sleep isn’t going to harm your son, so I think you did stress out about this more than you needed to — you could have just let him be and hopefully enjoyed yourself. ",

There’s an available car space and I pull in and there’s no way anyone else could fit behind me! I was between two bigger cars and needed to get into my boot to get my pram out! I’m waiting for the group to start, letting my baby sleep a little longer! Get out of the car and the resident of the house calls out to me having just returned home! \n\n‘You should be considerate of where you park’\n\nMe - the space was free so I took it, I’m sorry! \n\n‘I have health conditions and I struggle to walk far distances’ \n\n‘I’m sorry truly, I’m sorry!’ \n\nConversation ended, my friend arrives and we head into the group for over an hour! I return to a very horrible note left on my car from said lady that read:\n\n‘I hope you realise one day when you need consideration that you receive the same smirk as you gave me when I asked you to show a little thought for others! It’s called karma!’\n\nI’m a passive person, hate confrontation and honestly in that moment of her calling me out wanted to get in my car and leave! I don’t know if she wanted a fight or what she wanted out of it and I’m not fast on my feet when confronted like this ! I don’t recall myself smirking and it could have been a natural response of myself ‘shutting down’. I think I was in disbelief that this was happening! She could have knocked on my car window and asked if I could Move so she could park out the front but the spots aren’t marked for residents it’s a public street and she waited me out to speak to me but did so from her front step! I’m truly a considerate person and I find if it’s respect from both parties there’s no problem.\n\nI give her the benefit of the doubt that she could be having a bad day but she’s also lived in this street long enough to know that these things happen and she may be inconvenienced! \n\nLike am I in the wrong or is she being entitled and she’s being ageist towards me? And if she’s done it to me then has she done it to others? \n\nWhat would you have done or said in this interaction? Offered to move and please them? Or would she have still had a bee in her bonnet? Like am I truly the asshole in this situation?\n\nMy partner is petty and said he would have gone and parked his Ute there all day or have returned the letter to her! ",

      "scenario_description": "I'm an international student studying in the west in a male-dominated field. In one of my upper-year courses, there was only one woman in the class. We were randomly assigned partners for a major group project and I got paired with her.\n\nWhere I’m from, it’s uncommon for men and women to work together unless they’re related or married. I went to an all-boys school, never had a girlfriend, and have no sisters. My parents told me I can act how I want while abroad, and I’m not religious, but I still felt awkward because of how I was raised.\n\nOn top of that, her last name made it clear she was from a different religion that traditionally has tensions with mine. That added to the discomfort, even though I don’t personally care about religion. I was already nervous, this was a tough class that lots of people fail, and while I support women being in STEM, I also worried based on statistical likelihood that she might not be as strong (due to unfair systems not her fault). So I quietly asked the professor and TA to switch partners. He said no and I never brought it up again.\n\nThe project ended up going really well. We got full marks and won second prize in a department competition. We worked great together, and once I got over my awkwardness, I found out she wasn't religious either and we actually had really similar views on a lot of things. We became friends by the end and hung out in summer since we were both around.\n\nRecently she found out I had tried to switch. She asked me and I told her the truth. I tried to explain, but she was upset and said it was sexist and unfair.\n\nI understand why she’s mad, but I’ve changed and learned a lot. I never treated her badly. AITA?\n",

If I see a place has one I've never had, I'm definitely going to order it (and log it on Untappd)!\n\nSometimes a bar menu is out of date and they don't have that beer anymore. Thats never a problem for me, and I just order something else. I always make a point to be polite and lighthearted whenever ordered too. This weekend I ran into a string of bad luck though. \n\nOne place had to dig around for a while for a stout. That makes sense since thats more of a winter beer, and I thanked them profusely and tipped extra.\n\nA second place had a beer on tap that apparently few people order. They said they'd have to change the keg if I wanted a pint, but I said not to worry and ordered something else.\n\nAt the third place, I'm worried I took it too far. It was a sit-down restaurant with a server taking drink orders. On their menu they had two beers I hadn't seen before.\n\nI ordered one, and the server had to go and check with the bartender if they still had it. She came back saying they didn't carry it anymore, so I asked for the other one. Again, she had to check. She came back with the other drinks, and profusely apologized, but their menu was out of date and they didn't have that one either.\n\nI apologized too, and made a light joke about poor luck which she seemed to laugh at. I then ordered a Yuengling (pretty common beer in the northeast, but not available at every bar, and it was also on the menu). Once again, she checked, came back, and they didn't have it either.\n\nAt that point, my friend piped up and said \"he'll have a Bud Lite\". I said sure, and off she went. As soon as she left, that friend said \"Can you please not make her job any harder than it needs to be? She has other tables, you know.\"\n\nI apologized, and it was a bit awkward after that. I made sure to be extra nice to the server and to tip well, but now I'm worried that I took up so much of her time.\n\nAm I the AH here? If a venue says they have something, i think its fair game to try to order it. Maybe I should have gotten a more standard beer after they didn't have the first one though?",

      "scenario_description": "So a little context before I get into this, back in November I (20 M) was unemployed for about 2 months and got hired for a new job at the end of December. During this time I would get on my PlayStation and play with two of my close friends (both 21 M) from 10pm-11pm. At this time my girlfriend I live with was working closing shifts and coming home around 11pm or midnight so this is how I would wait up for her. \n\nThe first couple months of working I would still get on games with them when I wasn’t busy. I was working mornings at the same place as my girlfriend. Eventually she started working mornings but was scheduled a little earlier than me. Since we work at the same place we carpool and I started to wake up earlier than normal so that I could go with her. I start at 7am but she’ll start at 6 or 5am so usually I get up at 5 or 4am depending on the shift. My mental health got pretty bad a couple months ago and I started to fall asleep earlier because I was so tired all the time. It’s helped a lot I get around 7 hours of sleep if I fall asleep by 10pm and I’ve seen a difference in how I feel overall. \n\nI communicated with my two friends about how on work nights I couldn’t get on if it was at 10pm and id like still get on around 9pm instead if they wanna play games during the week. They’re both employed so I thought maybe they’d get it. Unfortunately both of them never made any changes to when they get on. I’d ask to get on earlier and they’d say not until 10 so I simply wouldn’t get on. I would inform them of my schedule and when I had off days and they’d still blow up my phone and call me on work nights around 10-10:30pm. At first I didn’t care too much because it was whatever but after a while it was annoying repeatedly telling them I have work so I can’t get on and then they still blow up my phone.\n\nThe real problems have happened in the past month or so. One time I did not answer the phone at 9:45, I didn’t think anything of it but then one of the friends started to call and text my girlfriend telling her to tell me to get on. I naturally was pissed and told him to not bother my girlfriend when I’ve already told him I have work so I can’t get on. Then after that every time I’ve said I cannot get on due to work they just make fun of me or get upset with me. They think it’s a funny joke and at first it didn’t bug me but now it’s ridiculous. Every time I talk to them even about normal things they get on me about not staying up until 11 or 12pm. \n\nI’ve communicated and talked to them bluntly about how I feel about things. I’ve tried to be understanding but I feel I’m at my wits end with this. I don’t want to drop them because they’re really good friends to me and I love playing with them but I feel they don’t understand the importance of sleep to me and how much it helps me. \n\nEdit: Thank you guys so much for this response. I will say I do put my phone on so not disturb but I have it set to let phone calls through including theirs because one of the friends has called me in the middle of the night a couple times with some very concerning stuff. I worry that’ll happen again and what’ll happen if I don’t answer that call. I appreciate everyone’s advice tho ! ",

      "post_title": "AITA for not attending my sister's second wedding?",
      "scenario_description": "I 42-year-old female hurt my back in June 2024; diagnosed with ruptured disk & Degenerative disk disease. My sister 40 planned wedding for August 2024 in Virginia, her choice weighed heavily on the fact that her future husbands family was from that area. He has a big family of about 12 siblings and plenty of other relatives, 90% his family still lives in the area within about a 100 mile or less radius. My family lives 800 miles from venue, my sister & I are about 1300 miles away from venue. I informed her in advance, I am not coming to her wedding because of my back & doctor advised against travelling far, I had no energy & taking a shower & putting on socks seemed almost impossible task. When time came, I told her I would not be going (as we discussed multiple times before.), I barely started treatment & was waiting to do my first Physical therapy session. I couldn’t even walk around a grocery store or do normal house hold task. My husband didn’t want me to go either due to amount of pain I was in daily. She was upset that I could not come. And she told me I was ruining her wedding. Now my sister does not have a close relationship with our mom's side of family. My sister is more about appearances than anything being genuine & it wasn’t fact that I was not coming it was more so fact that no one was coming from our mom's side of family. But I think if she cared who would attend, she would have made the wedding in a more neutral location, but she decided to cater to her husband's side of the family. They were already married in state before they left for the out of state wedding (which is just easier to go to the court house here if you are leaving the state for your wedding.) She could have had a small dinner and invited people locally and had a small celebration here and invited friends and family, if that was the case, I would have been able to get people to come here which is about a 7 hour drive or really short flight and a lot less expensive. I could have opened up my home for some people at no charge and she could have done the same. Honestly, I think she is A**hole & , to expect people to pay $$$$ to attend her wedding. For that she could have had a true destination wedding. & let's not forget she is 40 & this is her second marriage. For her 1st wedding, I made sure my mom, brother, & grandma attended & I drove them for 8 hours, also took time off work & stayed in a hotel & did whole wedding guest thing.\nWe had a family cruise coming in Jan 2025 which was booked in Feb 2024, before she even got engaged. We paid for it in advance before her wedding was even a thing. She started planning her wedding April after the cruise was already planned by her in January 2024.\n\n**Update:**\n\nMy sister texted me a day b4 cruise, If I needed someone to drive me to port. I told her my hubby was taking me to port, & I was staying night at hotel with family members & would arrive to port with them next day. To be honest I have an SUV & I think she just wanted to use me to help transport some of her spouse family & her dad's side of family to ship. This was first cruise on my mom's side of family so a lot of us did not know much or how to do things. We board ship, & my sister does not reach out at all. Day 2 evening at dinner when we were seated, we walked past her & her husband's family. Me & my mom got up to say hello. We walked over & I said sorry to interrupt but I just wanted to say hi to everyone & introduce myself. What we got back was no other than disrespect. No one said hi, there were about 8 people at the table. They just looked like we had poop on our face. My uncle asked what happened, I told him & was done with her games. The next day at breakfast she cornered my uncle and his wife and told them that we were mean, rude, malicious,  and disrespectful. (I literally just said hi). She said we as a collective had ignored her and didn't reach out to her. My uncle sided with me & defended me & my mom saying hi. He was so upset that he would never go on any event she had planned & would tell rest of family about her attitude. I also was in Physical therapy from September to end of December & was doing better.\n\nWe still have not talked and it's mid-July 2025 now. I think she owes me an apology. She had no concern about my well-being or my Financial situation knowing I had a back injury. And told me I was ruining her wedding. She also owes me an apology for her behavior on the cruise. \n\nJust for those who are wondering why I went on the cruise. The tickets were paid for by mid-summer, I had asked for the time off a year in advanced and rolled over a week of PTO to cover it. ",

      "scenario_description": "At 17, we moved to the West coast. I was obviously dejected and horrified because my entire life was on the east coast. However, I thought once I graduated highschool I would just apply to the colleges I actually wanted to go to (Howard, CAU, Spellman) and could find my way back home. \n\nExcept my mother basically refused to fill out the FASFA if I didn't apply exclusively to schools near the state she moved us to. Which would have ruined my life, given that we had a negative 1500 SAI, she had six dependents, food stamps, section 8. Looking at us, you wouldn't know a day in your life we were poor, but inside the house my mother was literally using my checks from my first minimum wage jobs to contribute to utilities and food. the only reason we were even still able to live in that house is because my payout from my first job shutting down was able to cover the rent  payment we almost got evicted for. \n\nI fell in love with a school in Texas and she filled out fasfa.  That kind of dependency on someone else drove me insane. I am hyper independent, and I've known my entire life that needing other people in any genuine capacity is unsafe. The whole fasfa game killed me. \n\nMy mother is abusive, my father is her enabler, so when push finally came to shove, I moved out the day after I graduated. I moved back to the East coast. I'm dating the boyfriend I left behind last time, I'm living with my best friend and her family I've known since sixth grade, my friend group is the strongest it's ever been. \n\nThe other school I got into is in Philadelphia which I originally didn't apply to, but they kept extending and extending and it felt like a sign. I applied secretly and now that I'm back here, in Maryland, it's only an hour away. They're still taking housing deposits, enrollments, ect. I basically have to give them 450 dollars to commit and get housing. They're giving me so much aid,  I'm closer to my hand crafted family, and I just get a clean slate. \n\n My boyfriend is offering to pay the enrollment if it means I'll go to the Philadelphia school but I'm  refusing to take the money from him. Not because I think he’s trying to trap me or I’m ungrateful. But because this is the dependency I KNOW is unsafe because it's consistently always been UNSAFE. Needing people has historically been bad for me. If he needed it,I swear I'd find a way to get it for him a hundred times. I don't care about GIVING money because obviously I know what it's like to not have it. It's the fact of him being my only option AND it being 500$.\n\nI'm probably going to get a waiver, but if I don't then I'm adamant I'm going to the Texas school where I already got set up with housing, orientation, ect",

      "scenario_description": "I had a friend come visit from out of town for a long weekend. We've been friend over 20 years,  and I was excited to see her.\n\nShe's had cats in the past, but married someone who is highly allergic to almost anything with fur, so she hasn't had any furred pets in many years (she has some reptiles). I have nurmerous cats, and she was also excited to get a weekend of kitties.\n\nHowever, it became clear very quickly that she doesn't live with cats. Leaving food unattended, putting cups on the edge of the coffee table/counter, etc, made it a very messy weekend. But whatever, right?\n\nThen there was the dental floss.\n\nFor context here, one of my cats ate a string he pulled out of a rug several months ago, and I paid THOUSANDS to save him. Like, he should have died - not only was it a very long string, but he had numerous post-op complications. But he is my baby, and it was money well spent to me. My cat learned exactly nothing from the experience - he still LOVES string and hair ties, and I am hypervigilant about such things being left out where he can access them.\n\nI told my friend she CANNOT throw dental floss in the bathroom trash - it has to go in the kitchen trash. The bathroom trash had a lid, but this cat is very smart and very determined. And in the event the lid doesn't get closed, it's essentially leaving string right at cat-height.\n\nWell, she didn't get the (very direct, not even a hint) hint. I kept finding floss in the bathroom trash, and twice I found it just laying on the counter, waiting to be swallowed. The first couple times, I tried to gently remind her. Then I directly told her again. When I found floss, yet again, just laying on the counter, I told her she needed to hand over her floss. I have the little floss picks she can use, but I cannot have long strings just being left around the house willy nilly. I cannot afford to have another major emergency vet surgery. I was not rude about it, and I did not yell or anything, but it was just too big a risk to keep allowing her to leave it lying about. \n\nShe complied, but after she went home her husband called me and said I was being totally put of line and treating her like a child, and that I should be more concerned with teaching my cat not to eat string. I do sort of see his point, but the reality is I tried to remind her not to do it, and it wasn't sticking. It's literally  a safety issue in my home - one that could mean life or death. If she couldn't manage to dispose of floss in the kitchen, then my only choice to protect my dumb ass cat is to remove the dangerous item. There is no \"teaching\" a cat to not use their insticts, and hunting/eating things is instinct.\n\nAITA here? I feel like no, but the way her husband acted, I'm now not totally sure.\n\n(And yes, I gave her floss back before she left. I'm not a floss thief)",

      "scenario_description": "So me (26M) and my girlfriend (25F) were making her cake for her birthday party tomorrow and I said that's too much sugar its disgusting I cant eat that (I was even disgusted to touch it). She almost cried telling me that's not nice her sister was in front and said the same too.\n\nFor context she nows I workout and I dont eat sugar and avoid procesed foods and carbs apart from sometimes fruit and honey in general while she eats everything.\n\nI had told her I would eat a small slice for her but after seeing the amount of sugar she put I rather eat my sole shoe than that and its not about the calories but the whole idea of putting that food in my mouth disgusts me. I guess she should have made a cake I could eat with fruit honey and almond floor for example.\n\n-edit: so I wanted to make update.\nIm never critical of my girlfriend eating \"unhealthy\" even i usually get her a desert she has one almost every day. I will occasionally when I feel she needs it try to encourage her to eat healthier but not with a negative attitude like it happened here. And I apologize and thanks for pointing it out and I hope you do better than me in similar circumstances. I will definitely won't repeat this again.\n\nAbout the comments telling me I have orthorexia I think you are right although it doesnt sound bad to me I'm just different? Recently I made some changes to my diet I primarily eat raw animal organs like brain liver heart eyes etc. Now even cooked meat somehow disgusts me and upsets and bloats my stomach when I eat it it even tastes tasteless. So I can say very few foods I feel nice when I eat them and raw organs are one of those.",

His wife, my stepgrandma (75~F) apparently found out I called the hospital and got in contact with his nurse and then eventually the doctor seeing over his care. Who gave me the updates she was unable or unwilling to provide. \n\nHe is in significantly worse shape than I assumed and I am going to visit him tomorrow. However she is extremely upset that I asked the doctor how much longer he has. He also recently had a stroke among other issues that I dont wish to share. I only called because I didnt want her to feel pressured or feel like she would need to take time away from my grandpa, her husband, to constantly update us on his condition.  She feels like I went behind her back and only wanted this info to spread rumors and start drama\n\nThe nurse in charge had me on hold for a couple minutes before she shared info. As well as his doctor called me directly to share info. I presumed somewhere along there they asked if they could share before they did. I strongly suspect they asked my grandpa if he was okay with them sharing info, and he agreed. Thats my guess. She also wasnt forthcoming with updates as I only called later in the day when we had no new info. I figured she, rightfully and understandably, was more focus on him than updating us.\n\nEither way she is upset, and might prevent me from seeing him potentially for the last time tomorrow due to this. Am I the asshole for potentially going behind her back to gain info on his condition?",

      "scenario_description": "I'm from South America and I lead a small team of seven (six women and one man). My team members all earn the legal minimum wage (about 1400 pesos/month) plus a small performance-based commission.\n\nThe man on our team is turning 23. He's a huge Real Madrid fan. A teammate had the idea to chip in for his birthday gift: a high-quality counterfeit jersey for 200 pesos. The rest of the team loved the idea. To put the price in perspective, an official jersey here costs 600 pesos, which is nearly half a month's minimum wage. The plan was for the seven of us to split the 200 peso cost, making it about 29 pesos each.\n\nHowever, I have strong personal values against buying or gifting counterfeit goods. I told the team to wait, and that I might be able to get a discount on an authentic jersey through a contact at Adidas. I managed to get a 40% discount, bringing the price of an original down to 360 pesos. To make it work, I offered to contribute 100 pesos myself, leaving 260 for the other six team members to cover. This would have made their share about 43 pesos each.\n\nThey told me the extra 14 pesos was too much and voted to stick with the counterfeit one.\n\nI replied that if they were going with the fake, I was out. I couldn't contribute to it. Now, the six of them will pay about 33 pesos each. I plan to give him a separate, smaller, but authentic gift from me. My team seems a bit annoyed by my decision.\n\nWIBTA if I refuse to contribute to the group gift over my principles, even though my actions have made things slightly more expensive and complicated for them?",

I have 2 German Shepards, Jameson & Guinness. My house is their house. I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   \n\nThis friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  \n\nI backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.  If you just pet them, they'll leave you alone.  After a brief convo, they decided to leave. I told them they don't call the shots at my house about my dogs.   The rest of my friends were split on how I acted. Some said it wasn't a big deal to put them in another room for a few hours and others said I was right.  AITA?  ",

I asked if we could have a smaller portion of the pasta dish set aside without the meat for attendees. She said no. I asked if outside food is permitted and she said it's a liability issue.

      "scenario_description": "Hey there! This is my first post on this reddit.......topic. Going to say that this happened last Tuesday and I'm still pretty upset about it. This isn't that long so I'll make this as long as I possibly can.\n\nFor private reasons we're going to name my sister Susie. My mom told me that she was going to a business conference in DC, so I was going to stay at my grandma's house for the week. Reminder, I have no car or a license. Something happened and I don't know what, but I was given one extra day from the day I was supposed to be there, I was meant to be dropped off on Monday but went there on Tuesday instead. My sister offered to take me to my grandma's house herself (according to my mom). Now to the story part.\n\nThe day comes around and I'm getting ready to leave with her, get my suitcase downstairs, my blowup mattress, the sheets and comforters for the mattress, my hygiene stuff, the stuff I bring for entertainment, the food I got, etc. My sister was putting so much pressure on me to get me ready as fast as possible, because she had to go home for work (not where me and my mom live). Keep telling me she was going to leave with or without me, told me to hurry up despite her apartment is a couple hours away from here, and kept telling me that she was going to leave in 35 minutes, 10 minutes, 7 minutes, like no time whatsoever. We forgot this Army monument thing that we were supposed to take to my grandma's house to pay tribute to my grandfather who died 2 years back, but I nearly forgot the food, I had to rush to get everything in there. Thankfully that was my last trip in there, but when I walked out of the house my sister's car was gone. I got so upset I immediately started to call her, but then I looked around a bit and just saw she parked in the parking lot across the street (my house is on a hill). I know you have to go back home but, come on Susie! That was not a cool thing to do. Then when we started to go to my grandma's house, she told me \"It's very rude to take that long\". Oh, I forgot to mention that most of my stuff was already in her car.\n\nFast forward to Sunday and my mom was picking me up from my grandmother's house. I told her everything on what happened with my sister. She was not that thrilled about it and told me that she was just going to take me there next time. I also found out about my sister offering to take me from my mom. I was really pissed on how she handled this, but I also feel a bit bad about the situation. If I'm the one to blame for this, please let me know. So, AITA for wasting my sister's time?",

      "scenario_description": "So here’s what happened. My friends, John and Jane, and I were supposed to meet in my town for a festival, but it got rained out. I offered to drive toward them instead (about an hour for me) so we could still hang out and get dinner. Everyone agreed, and we met at a restaurant John picked—not a bar, just a dinner spot—but it was super crowded and loud. None of us could really hear each other talking.\n\nWe had a great meal and finished up. While we were boxing up our leftovers, John (kindly) paid for dinner. Then he and Jane ordered another beer. I don’t drink, so I was just sitting there. About 45 minutes passed with them slowly sipping their beers—John was mostly on his phone—and I finally said, “Okay, you guys gotta chug those, let’s go for a walk or something.”\n\nTen more minutes passed and they still weren’t even halfway through. I finally said, “Alright, we’re leaving—you can leave the beers.” John walked downstairs to finish his at the bar, and Jane said, “Well, he paid for it—he wants to finish it.” I responded, “It’s been almost an hour. It’s loud, hot, and you’ve both been on your phones.”\n\nI left feeling like they were annoyed with me, but honestly, I was frustrated. They both know I don’t drink and that I have sensory issues—it’s hard for me to sit in chaotic environments like that, especially doing nothing and being ignored. When I first asked them to finish their beers, I suggested we walk around downtown so we could actually do something and still hang out, but they didn’t seem interested. I had driven an hour to meet them and tried to be flexible after our original plan got rained out, but it felt like they weren’t meeting me halfway.\n\nThis isn’t a one-time thing either. They regularly invite me to stay the night—even though they know I have two dogs and two cats at home, and I always tell them I can’t leave my animals overnight. Even on the Fourth of July, after I explained that I stay home because fireworks are hard on my pets, they kept asking me to come out again. It’s like my answers or boundaries aren’t enough, and they just ignore or push past them.\n\nAnother layer: whenever plans change—especially if I’m the one suggesting something different—John always makes little digs or sarcastic comments about how he doesn’t enjoy the new plan as much. It’s subtle, but it adds up and makes me feel like a bad friend just for asking for something different or more comfortable for me.\n\nI guess I’m just feeling weird right now. Like… am I reading too much into things? Am I being overly sensitive? Or are these red flags in a friendship that’s become kind of one-sided? I’m trying to be self-aware here, but I also feel kind of disrespected. So—AITA?",

Granted it’s weird that they were on their phones, but it still doesn’t give you the right to order them around. You could have explained the reasons you were uncomfortable in the restaurant and said that YOU were leaving, giving them the option to come with you or not or to finish their drinks and meet you later.",

For some context i have been a gold girlie since i was born i only wear gold jewelry and everyone that knows me knows this including my boyfriend, because in the past he had already gifted me with gold jewelry. and for even more context my boyfriend is the type of person that procrastinates everything so he bought my birthday gift the day before my birthday. The day of the party my boyfriend was the first guest to arrive and he brought me a jewelry bag and told me to open it, i opened the bag and inside was a silver bracelet with 2 hearts pendants one being rose gold and the other one being gold, i was going to thank him for the bracelet when he realized that i didn’t like it he asked me if i liked it and i told him no, he looked visibly upset and i tried apologizing and asking him why did he buy me a silver bracelet he told me that in the store the bracelet looked gold. I don’t want to sound ungrateful and spoiled but i was visibly upset by that gift not because of the bracelet but because it looked like he didn’t even knew what i liked. I looked the bracelet online and it wasn’t expensive and for the same price and lower he could have gotten me something that i would like more. im going to put the link to the bracelet so ya’ll can see it \n\nhttps://www.onewatchcompany.com/pt/one-jewels/pulseira-one-crazy-heart-united_p2004.html\n\nAm i the asshole?",

Your preference in metals is not actually a salient fact that everyone around you is paying constant attention to, and even if he knows you like gold, the bracelet had gold pendants on it so it was reasonable for him to think you might like it. You didn’t, and that’s ok, sometimes gifts don’t hit the mark, but you could have been gracious about it. ",

I really do appreciate it but growing up he always said that when my sister and I got married we’d each get fifteen thousand dollars to use however we wanted. Whether it was for a big wedding, eloping, saving for a house, it was supposed to be our choice.\n\nMy sister got married a couple years ago and had a big traditional wedding. My dad paid for everything with his credit card and she tracked all the costs in a spreadsheet. It ended up being about fifteen thousand.\n\nNow I’m engaged and my fiancé and I decided we want to elope and keep it super simple so we can save for a house. But now my dad is acting kind of weird about the money. He doesn’t really like the elopement idea and keeps saying we should just use his credit card and track expenses like my sister did.\n\nThe thing is we are not planning to spend anywhere near the full amount. I was hoping he would just give us the money like he always said so we could use it how we want. I get that maybe it feels different for him if he is not directly paying for stuff, but it kind of feels like we only get the full amount if we do things his way…. !? \n\nAm I being a spoiled brat for not wanting to follow the exact same plan my sister did?",

      "scenario_description": "I (30f) have my family (senior mother and adult sisters) visiting this week and we plan on going to a museum in an hour. I have my daughter (5 mo) in a stroller. We decided to go to the museum via public transportation where the destination station doesn't have an elevator to get to the street level. \n\nMy husband (33 m) won't be joining us on this trip and I expressed that it may be hard to get out of the station with no elevator. My husband suggests that we should carry the entire stroller up/down the stairs or escalator as is (not folded) with the help of my sisters where one would hold the handle and another holding the front/wheels area.\n\nI think this is incredibly dangerous to do with a baby and say I'd rather take off the baby seat, fold the carriage and have one of my family members carry the folded stroller while I have the baby seat with baby. This turned into a huge argument with him saying it's a skill issue if we can't do it his way. I told him his idea is delusional, saying we've watched multiple videos of people before fail at doing this with other objects. I then said there's no reasoning with him and that I was done with him.\n\nSo AITA\n\nUpdate: Thank you everyone for your comments. Just a quick mention that both my husband and I crafted the post and we both read what you all said separately. After reading, my husband apologized for being argumentative. He felt like he needed to defend his idea after I dismissed it the first time. I apologized for calling his idea delusional. Apparently a lot of you do it even though I've never seen it myself. But to be fair, I also don't take public transportation regularly. I still will go through with my idea because I don't know what I'd do if I messed up and had to watch my infant just tumble down the stairs or escalator so I guess it is, in fact, a skill issue.",

Every Saturday I try and sleep until 10am it never works but I still try. My bf is always glued to his phone and can’t complete a single action without looking at his phone first. So the second his eyes are open he gets on instagram. He is hard of hearing and plays his videos at full volume. We wakes up early on his own and immediately opens instagram and starts watching videos. I have repeatedly expressed that it wakes me up before I’m ready and is a problem.  He always says it was a mistake I didn’t mean to do that and I have explained it’s not a mistake if it happens over and over again it’s a choice at this point. It is worth stating that I just started my period the day before at work without knowing. And he has his own office downstairs. I also suffer from insomnia so it’s hard for me to get to sleep. I’m tired of going round and round about the same issues. We’ve had break conversations earlier in the week and all he ever does is say sorry without changing a thing. So am I the asshole or is he?",

      "scenario_description": "I (26M) live with my 25-year-old wife and her parents (early 50s) in a house by the water in Queens, New York. We moved in back in 2022 to save money when my wife went back to school full-time for her NP. We pay $500 a month in rent, which is a steal. We plan to stay here until she finishes school in 2027, save aggressively, and move down south. Her parents plan to retire in 2028 and eventually follow us. There is no central air, just window units. every summer Since we moved, there has been constant tension. My wife and I live in the basement with our 3 cats. The basement collects heat and humidity, so we have to run our AC 24/7 or it gets muggy fast. Her parents are convinced my wife and I are the reason their electric bill is high. Meanwhile, they have a hot tub that runs constantly, but somehow we are the issue. They installed solar panels last year but do not have a battery or sell excess power back to the grid. If they do not use the solar energy during the day, it is wasted. Their routine from May to August is AC off overnight, windows open, even after running the AC all morning. Windows stay open into afternoon when it is 85° or more with high humidity. The house heats up to outdoor temps. Around 3pm, they close the windows and crank the ACs back on, forcing them to work harder to cool the heat-soaked, moisture-filled house. Sometimes they leave the windows open all day and night. The longest was 4.5 days by choice. It was 89° in the house, 92° in the basement. I spoke up multiple times, but they brushed me off until I finally snapped and yelled. One of our cats started vomiting from the heat, and the vet said she was overheated. This was with our mini-split running 24/7. Some days they run the AC in the living room while their bedroom window is wide open. It makes no sense. They don’t realize that Modern units are more efficient when run consistently. Also, they make over 250k a year combined.\n\nI tracked the basement in June with an air quality sensor: average temp was 84 degrees with 72 percent humidity. Since moving here, I have had nonstop sinus infections, skin issues, and respiratory problems.\n\nI have explainedHow humidity affects AC efficiency How they waste solar power by not using it during the day That modern window units work better when run steadily\n\nAnd before you say JUST MOVE OUT, it’s not that simple. Besides this, we have it pretty good here. I know this is a privileged situation, but I think my frustration is valid. If we moved out and wanted similar space, we would be paying 5000 to 7500 a month because I would need to rent a separate workspace. That would destroy our savings plan.\n\nWhen I confronted them, they said they like fresh air. Another time they told me to pay the 1000 dollar electric bill. I said I would gladly pay it if they just tried it without opening the windows. Now I passive-aggressively close the windows every night after they go to bed.\n\nAITA for insisting we keep the windows closed?",

Running the AC full time in the basement is fine, though you could pay a little extra in the summer to make up for it and still be saving a lot of money. However, YTA for insisting they keep the windows closed. It’s their house. They like fresh air. They’re entitled to have their own preferences in their own home. It’s totally out of line for you to come in and demand they change their ways when they’re already doing you a favor with such cheap rent. You can either accept it or move. ",

      "scenario_description": "There’s an event going on in the town I live in right now. Nothing big happens here often, so it’s a big deal for everyone. I (F23) had originally planned to go with my partner of three years (M31) and a group of friends on Friday, but I couldn’t get out of my closing shift at work so I couldn’t go. I told my partner to go ahead with the group, but he said if I couldn’t go, he didn’t want to go either because he didn’t want me to be missing out while he had fun. I made it clear to him that I didn’t mind, but he insisted. Now we both still want to attend, and the event is going on for another two days. \n\nMy mum asked me to go to the same event today, and I told her no because my partner can’t attend with us, and we wanted to go together. She is now up in arms about how I’m choosing to let her down instead of letting my partner down, and that if I was with a ‘grown man’, he’d be happy to see me go. She said that he should be able to handle his own disappointment and shouldn’t have trouble being left behind. \n\nHere’s the thing. I did not ask my partner if I could go. He doesn’t know my mum wanted me to go with her. I said no because I am being considerate of my partner. It is something we wanted to do together, and I would feel bad going without him, ESPECIALLY after he turned down an opportunity to go without me. I know he would tell me to go and not worry about it, but the principle of the matter is we planned to go together, and if we can’t both go, I don’t want to go at all. \n\nMy mother is now ignoring my messages and is clearly very upset with me for not wanted to go with her. I understand why she’s let down, but I can’t seem to get her to understand why I don’t want to go. \n\nAm I the AH for not going to an event with my mother that I initially planned on attending with my partner?

      "scenario_description": "My younger sister is temporarily living with us and she was having a hard time studying because my 3 y.o. son would constantly interrupt and ask her to play with him whenever she was studying in the living room/kitchen. She asked if she could use my husband’s office so he wouldn’t bother her and I agreed since my husband wasn’t in the country (he lives abroad about 70% of the time) at the time anyway.\n\nI don’t think I did anything wrong but my husband came home as a surprise before the office had been cleaned up and he was angry at me for letting her use it without asking him first. Like I said he wasn’t in the country and he wasn’t supposed to visit any time soon so I thought it would be fine since it’s not like he needed it at the time. He doesn’t see it the same way and thinks I should’ve asked first since it’s his office.\n\nWe’ve had a few arguments over this with neither of us budging. Admittedly in our last fight I did get angry and tell him he shouldn’t even have a home office since he’s barely home which did unfortunately escalate the fight. Part of the reason I said that is because my husband was never happy about my sister living here even though it’s had a very minimal impact on him and I feel like he’s using this office situation as an opening to send her back home.\n\nI've already bought a desk for her room so she can study in there but AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (45 F) am hosting a 50th birthday party for my husband in a few weeks. We have decided not to invite any children other than our own for cost reasons. We have 2 kids (10 M and 7 F). I have a cousin “Amelia” who is a single parent of an 11 month old baby. Amelia asked if her baby can come to the party and I said no because it wouldn’t be fair to the other guests who also have kids, including our own nieces and nephews. \n\nSome important background: over a year ago Amelia had a baby shower in which she invited myself and my daughter and all the other girl cousins but did not invite any boys so my son wasn’t invited. My son is neurodivergent and does not understand nuance like that so we asked my aunt (Amelia’s mom) who was hosting the shower and she made an exception for my son to come. \n\nI sent the invitations for the party about two weeks ago and Amelia called me up a few days later and said she wasn’t sure if she’d be allowed to bring her daughter. Her daughter’s father is not in the picture and neither is his family and since her parents and siblings will be attending our party, she doesn’t have a sitter. She also brought up the fact that she’s still breastfeeding and really doesn’t leave her daughter for more than a few hours. Her baby will be just about a year old at the time of the party. I told her that she could not bring her baby and explained that it wouldn’t be fair to the other guests, most of whom also have kids. She said she understands that logic and that’s why she didn’t invite boys to her shower, because many of her friends have sons and she only wanted it to be kids in the family. She brought up that her mom made an exception for me and that she understands if I can’t let her daughter come but that she will not be in attendance. My cousin is the oldest “grandchild” in his family and the oldest of our friend group so many of our friends and family members also have babies. A few are younger than Amelia’s daughter but aren’t breastfeeding and I don’t want them to feel left out because I let Amelia’s baby come and not theirs. We really do not want a million kids running around. \n\nI was telling my mom about this and she is giving me a hard time. She said it won’t cost anything because Amelia’s baby won’t have her own plate and that breastfeeding moms are different. She feels bad because Amelia is a single mom. She also feels embarrassed that I asked for an exception and won’t give one in return. I am feeling a little hurt that everybody in the family is giving me a hard time and I’m just wondering if I’m the asshole for not making an exception when I asked for one for my own child? ",

She’ll stop for weeks or months, then start drinking again, mostly on weekends. When it starts creeping into weekdays, she usually brings it up herself and says she needs to quit. She’s in therapy and has even mentioned considering AA recently, which I fully support.\nAnyway, we’ve been house hunting, and at one of the places we looked at, someone mentioned the unfinished basement could be turned into a wine cellar. They quickly added, “But I don’t drink wine.” I replied with, “Yeah, I don’t either, but sometimes my girlfriend does.”\nA couple of days, she told me that comment really hurt her feelings. She said she’s been struggling not to drink, and what I said felt unsupportive. I told her it was unintentional but I didn’t understand what I did wrong. I wasn’t trying to shame her, just stating a fact in context. The conversation spiraled into an argument, then she shut down and acted like nothing had happened.\nI’m stuck. When she’s drinking, I’m not really allowed to say anything without her getting defensive or lashing out. But now, even saying she sometimes drinks, even though it’s true, is apparently hurtful. I feel like I’m being made responsible for her struggle, like I’m walking on eggshells.\nI want to support her, but I genuinely don’t know what that looks like anymore.\nAITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I (21 F) am a lifeguard captain, especially meaning I make the weekly schedules and do paperwork on top of what normal guards need to do. I don’t mind the work at all but it can get stressful especially if kids call out without warning because we only have 5 kids per day and the legal minimum is 4. Today I messed up the schedule and put “Chris” on the schedule instead of “Kevin” even though “Chris” was off. This is on top of another guard calling out because her ear piercing got severely infected. So we’re now down to 3 and at this same time I learned that the day prior on my required day off Kevin realized I wasn’t coming in and took it upon himself to leave 4 HOURS early. Leaving everyone else scrambling to fix the holes in the schedule he left behind. Learning this in conjunction with me needing him here today I texted him frantically if he could come in to no response besides “busy”. So in my anger 15 minutes later I texted him that leaving 4 Hours early the other day was unacceptable and I was going to our manager about it. Within minutes Kevin is lighting up my phone like a Christmas tree with him justifying why he left but I was too busy trying to find another lifeguard to help to pay him any mind. He called me and I picked up asking if he could work and once he said no I hung up and texted him saying “if you aren’t working don’t call me” because I needed to call our manager for help. Suddenly his attitude shifted now saying “I can work today” and “Don’t come after me when I’m the one doing you a favor” I thanked him and tried explaining to him I wasn’t mad at him for “being busy on his day off” but for abandoning everyone the other day when he realized I wasn’t coming in. He insists he left for an emergency and that “I would’ve done it whether you were here or not” and is now refusing to look at me or talk to me. Am I the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "I (20F) live in a flat with 3 other girls. We recently moved in, and everything was fine until I mentioned that I’m planning to start tutoring kids (from our building) at home.\n\nMy dad is going through financial problems and can’t send me money right now, so I really need to earn and support myself. I don’t want to be a burden on him. I haven’t started tutoring yet, but I plan to teach around **8–10 kids** between **5 PM and 7 PM**, either in the **hall or my room**, whichever works best. This is a very normal tuition time in India.\n\nThe issue is, one of my flatmates is against it. She says **5–7 PM is her study time**, and she’ll be disturbed by the noise. She also said she needs to **sleep by 10 PM**. However, we all have **college from 8 AM to 4 PM**, so realistically, most of our free time starts after that—and from what I’ve observed, she doesn’t go to sleep at 10 PM anyway.\n\nI even offered to:\n\n* Let her study wherever she feels comfortable during that time\n* Keep the kids in one area with the door closed\n* Manage the noise as much as possible (though the flat isn’t soundproof)\n\nDespite trying to compromise, she’s completely against the idea.\n\nI understand shared living requires consideration, and I’m trying to be respectful. But I also really need this income and don’t think my request is unreasonable.\n\nWe have 2 rooms and one hall with open kitchen connecting to hall. \n\nSo Reddit—**AITA for wanting to tutor kids at home in the evening even if it might slightly disturb one flatmate?** \n\nA lot of you shared your suggestions and advices. I'm really grateful to you all. \n\nAs of now I'm considering to change in timings for tutoring and making it only one hour **6:30pm-7:30pm**. So that she can study peacefully and don't get disturbed. \n\nWith 5-6 kids at most. \n\nKeeping the environment as quite as possible.\n\n(Also I have noticed while talking to her that she has no problem with the kids if I share my students with her to teach, but I'm really not in favor of it considering I reached out to everyone for tutoring despite being new here and there is a chance I don't get as much kids as expected.) \n\nOn a side note-\n\nThere are no libraries within a radius of 5km.\n\nI can't afford a space as of now. \n\nThere is no common space available in building.\n\nI need to make money to pay my rent aswell. \n\n\n \n\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "Posting for a friend who wishes to stay anonymous.\n\nHi, my name is Lois. My husband Bryan and I adopted our son James through a private adoption. He’s nine months old now, but at the time of this story, he was six months and had just come home from the ER after a couple of nights due to low oxygen levels (he’s fine now, just has minor non-life-threatening health issues).\nBefore we knew we’d be adopting James, we had a trip to NYC booked for our anniversary. When the time came, I was torn—do we take him or leave him with my mom and sister (both RNs who watch him often)? Ultimately, we decided it was safer and more stable for James to stay with them, where he had doctors familiar with his history. It broke my heart to leave him, but we felt it was best. My best friend Harper, who watches James every other Friday (only twice a month), agreed to help on one of the days we were gone. I was really grateful. Two weeks later was her regularly scheduled Friday. She hadn’t watched James in a while because she’s been backing out a lot last-minute, so my brother-in-law has had to fill in. On this Friday, I mistakenly thought James was with my brother-in-law and not Harper. After work, I stopped by the store when Harper called asking if I was late to pick up James. I was mortified and apologized, saying I was 10 minutes away and had mixed up who had him. She said nothing then, but I didn’t hear from her for weeks. I finally texted asking if we were okay, and she asked me to call her. When I did, she told me I was a bad mom, that I adopted James for the wrong reasons, and said it seemed like I just wanted an accessory, like a pet. I was devastated. We’ve been best friends for 20 years. My husband and I tried to conceive for over five years before turning to adoption. We chose private adoption specifically to avoid agencies that pressure birth moms—we personally knew James’s birth mom and offered her support if she wanted to raise him herself. It was a decision made with love and care. I told Harper her words deeply hurt me and that leaving James behind on the trip and being late to pick him up once didn’t make me a bad mom. But those were the two things she cited. It’s been weeks. She hasn’t apologized, but two days ago she texted asking if I needed her to watch James next Friday. I responded that I’d rather focus on repairing our friendship and that I didn’t want to strain things further by asking her to babysit. I asked where we stood, but she’s since ghosted me. I’ve always supported her through her journey as a young mom without judgment. I’m trying to figure out if I’m in the wrong here, or if it’s time to walk away after 20 years. I’m open to honest feedback.",

      "scenario_description": "Earlier this week I (40F) was on a flight from LA to San Francisco. After I boarded the flight and was comfortably settled into my window seat in premium economy I got a notification that my seat had been upgraded to first class — seat 4F, another window seat. \n\nI gathered my stuff and got up to move, trying to work quickly because I assumed it was an overbooked flight and someone had been given my original seat. As I made my way to the front, along with another guy who had been upgraded from coach, the flight attendant (35F or so) told us to take any open seat. The guy (65M or so), who had been upgraded from an aisle seat, took the window seat. \n\nI asked the flight attendant, in what I thought was a quiet voice, if I could have my assigned window seat. I explained that I’m a very nervous flyer and prone to nausea if I’m not next to a window. She said no because they were “about to close the door.” \n\n(For context: I don’t mean to be high maintenance, but I witnessed a small plane crash as a kid and I’ve been scared of flying ever since. I work with a therapist on how to deal with it, since I need to travel a couple times per month for my job, and my coping method is Xanax + a window seat. When I’m scared my stomach churns. I don’t love it. But it’s what happens.) \n\nThe guy in the window seat overhears and gets up to give me the seat, but instead of doing it with kindness he rolls his eyes and loudly sneers “I’ve never heard of anyone throwing up because they’re not in a window seat.”\n\nAt this point I’m super embarrassed, and don’t want to sit next to this guy, so I said “oh this is clearly going to be a thing, can I just have my original seat back?”\n\nLuckily the seat was still open, so I sat back down next to the window. I truly didn’t care about not sitting in first class. It’s a short flight. The interaction has been bothering me for days though. Was I the AH? Am I an entitled person in the eyes of the other passengers? Was the guy? The flight attendant for not just asking us to sit in our assigned seats?",

      "scenario_description": "So I went to the law school library to study. There are three floors, you enter through the third floor (the second floor of the overall building) and there is a ground level floor and a basement floor beneath it. The other floors have their own exits, but these are for emergencies only and trigger the alert. That doesn't make a lot of architectural sense, but I didn't build the place.\n\nSo there are small tables for one person and large tables for two persons, most tables are for two persons. The latter have two seats two adjustable lamps and two power sockets, while the former have only one of each. I'm bit late and all the large tables that I can see are already taken, but I don't check every single table in the library on all three floors. I didn't check the basement floor, which is not as nice in terms of lightning and air. The books I need are on the second floor. So I sit down on one seat on a table in the second floor where the other seat is already occupied. That person is currently absent, but he left his notebook and books there. I lay out my books, taking care that my stuff doesn't cross the centre line. \n\nFive minutes or so later the other guy returns and protests that he was away for but twenty minutes. I point out that his seat is free, he replies this isn't common. Feeling slightly baffled I tell him the library is full. He leaves and a few minutes later returns and grabs his stuff, apparently he found a free double table somewhere.\n\nNow, yes, naturally everyone one wants a double table for themselves to have more room for their stuff, and it is in fact rare to see two people on one table. Still, you can't have that be your expectation if the place is filling up. It's unreasonable, in my view, to think the place should operate at half capacity at all times when most of the tables are clearly designed with two people in mind. ",
