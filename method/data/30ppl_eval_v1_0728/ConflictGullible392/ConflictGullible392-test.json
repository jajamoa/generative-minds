      "scenario_description": "So me (23f) and my fiancé  (22m) got engaged around a month ago. We are from 2 different states MO&KY but currently live in my home state MO. Where his family is from is about an 11 hour drive. After getting engaged we (us and our moms) all decided it would be best to have a wedding in MO. His mom volunteered to have a 2nd wedding reception in KY that way certain people (mainly family friends & distant family) could celebrate with us without having the burden of traveling. \n\nAfter location and rough date had been decided his grandma decided that since we were having a reception in KY she will not be coming to our wedding in MO. There is no reason that she can’t travel as she has taken numerous 10-15 hour trips in the last 2 years. We would completely understand if there was a financial reason, a medical reason, or something along those lines but there just isn’t. \n\nWith all of that being said I want to know if I would be the asshole if I put my foot down and refused to invite her to the reception in KY if she refuses to attend her first grandson getting married in MO after invites actually get sent out. \n\nWe just found this news out so my fiancé does not have a strong opinion either way yet as we are both still just pretty upset.\n\nETA : the point of the 2nd reception is not to provide an option. The point of the 2nd reception is to create an opportunity for people who can not travel for any reason. I appreciate the responses I have received but I would like to clarify that it is primarily for family friends and distant family who will not be invited to the wedding in MO anyway.",

She got home about an hour or so before I got home from work, we were chatting about what we got up to, she said she hopes I didn't live off takeaway. I said no I made a spicy curry on one night and I put another couple of portions in the freezer, she burst out laughing and saying \"oh no is that what that was, I threw it away\" I thought she was joking at first but from the way she carried on laughing I started to think she meant it, I checked the freezer and it was gone. \n\nI got really angry I called her a b*tch and a c*nt (context, here in the UK that word is thrown around a lot more casually than the US) I kept throwing snide remarks at her over the following hours. She kept saying I should have told her that was mine. Even though I'd told her before she left I was planning on making a spicy curry as she can't handle spicy food and that was my opportunity to have it. And she'd just got home not long before me and found time to do that. I left her really upset and she refused to eat dinner and has been giving me the silent treatment since.",

      "scenario_description": "I kind of offended one of my friends the other day and it’s been bothering me. Most of our shared friends aren’t bothered, but his closest friend is definitely pissed off at me so I’m wondering if I was the asshole in this situation. \n\n\n\nOur friend group met through the local music scene and we all live within like ten minutes of each other. Last weekend, we all went out with a few other people (a bunch of guys who played the previous night and Taylor’s gf, Jade f26) for brunch after getting drunk the night before. This is normal for us.\n\n\n\nContext: a few of us have eating disorders. I (m22) do, Edward (m27) does, David (m20) does and we often talk about our disorders and other people’s together. If you’ve never had an ED, you won’t know this but we’re all obsessed with our disorders. It helps us cope, I guess. All of us, including Taylor, also have pretty dark senses of humor too. We joke about each other’s drug use, David’s dead dad, my health problems (related to my ED), each other’s body issues and more. Taylor’s never had a problem with it before.\n\n\n\nAt brunch, me and Edward just got iced coffee and Jade got a diet coke, so Taylor was one of the only people at our table actually eating. Everyone else we went with at the other tables were eating a lot, so it’s not like Taylor stood out that much or anything. After a while, I started talking about some celebrity’s weight loss to David because we both heard about it online. I was just talking to David but Jade kept giving me weird looks the whole time until she left for the bathroom.\n\n\n\nTaylor ate his food kind of fast and then said he was going out for a cigarette before leaving the diner. A few minutes later, I finished my coffee and I wanted to smoke too so I went outside and into the alley behind the restaurant. As soon as he heard me, Taylor looked up in a kind of panicked way and took his fingers out of his mouth, totally covered in vomit.\n\n\n\nThe moment was super uncomfy, since I just caught him purging, so I made a stupid kind of joke to lighten things up. I said that Edward and David each owe me twenty bucks, because Edward bet Taylor was orthorexic and David thought he wasn’t disordered at all but I was right that he was bulimic. It’s not out of place, considering our humor but Taylor looked upset and begged me not to tell Jade.\n\n\n\nLater, Edward said what I said to Taylor was really fucked up. He’s normally really close to Taylor but now Taylor isn’t talking to him and now he’s taking it out on me. David thinks everyone knows about our EDs now so he’s upset about that. If I did do something fucked up, I think Edward is just as guilty because he’s the one who started taking bets on Taylor’s disorder. So AITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "So, my dad owns a condo. I rent one of the rooms in it, and I live with 3 other people that also rent rooms there. We also live in SoCal where temparatures are very high right now.\n\nWe've had some issues with the A/C. Basically, we thought someone was turning it on an setting it to be extremely low, which obviously could potentially drive up costs and raise our rent. We figured out that, because it was one of those modern gimmicky digital thermostats, it was automatically turning itself on. We figured it out and fixed the issue.\n\nMy dad implemented a rule afterwards (around a month ago) that no one is to set the A/C below 70 degrees. We've been following it. It was recently changed such that we can no longer run it below 74 degrees.\n\nLate last night, my girlfriend was over. We were sweating profusely, both in my room and the living room. So I had the A/C run at 74 degrees that night, and ensured all the windows were closed.\n\nThis morning I got a text from my roommate Steven, which said (and I'm copy and pasting the entire text except my name), \"Hi FireRaptor220, YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE AIR CONDITIONING ON ALL NIGHT. IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. WE DON'T WANT YOUR DAD TO RAISE OUR UTILITIES, RIGHT?$$$$$\". I don't know if it matters, but he lives in the master bedroom, so he does pay more than the other three of us.\n\nI could definitely understand him being upset if I had, say, turned it down to 60, or if I had turned it on when we didn't need it. But I turned it on to 74, and only because it was unbearably hot in the house. I kind of feel like if we can't use the AC to cool down, then what's the point of it, you know?\n\nI haven't replied to him yet because I'm figuring out what to say. AITA, Reddit?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi Reddit! I (F20) have been dating my girlfriend, let’s call her Angie (F21), for about nine months now, and I genuinely adore her. She’s kind, smart, funny, and just overall a wonderful person. I really do feel lucky to have her in my life. That said… she *loves* to sing. Like, all the time, but especially in the car. And to be clear, she’s incredibly talented. She’s done choir throughout school, she’s a musical theatre major, and she truly has an amazing voice. Most of the time, I love hearing her sing and perform. It’s something I admire about her cause god know I cant hold a tune to save my life. \n\nHowever, when we’re driving together, it honestly gets on my nerves. I don’t mean every now and then, it’s constant. For example, the other night we were driving home from a mutual friend’s place. I put on some music in the background and started talking asking her about her day. As soon as there was a lull in the conversation, she turned the music up and started singing. I let it go for a song or two, but when turned it back down and tried to resume the conversation, she gave me a one-word answer, turned it up and went right back to singing. This kind of thing happens all the time. I try not to be overly sensitive about it, but it makes me feel like she’s not interested in talking to me. I’ve brought it up a couple of times, but she usually brushes it off and tells me that it just passes the time, which it does, for her…meanwhile I’m driving next to what feels like a brick wall. Sometimes I try to sing along, but she’ll say something like “It’s not a duet”  in a joking way but I know she means it. \n\nI really do love her, and I don’t want to make her feel like she can’t be herself around me but I also don’t want to feel ignored every time we’re in the car together. So am I the asshole for wanting her to dial it back a bit in the car?\n\n",

When yesterday came however, I woke up 2 hours before we were supposed to go out and I offered to reschedule for the next day, to which she was positive about and agreed.\n\nHowever, the next day (today), when I went to see her at a location we agreed on, she wasn't there. I called her about 6 times and I was genuinely worried that something went wrong.\n\nAt around 8PM, she messaged me and she seemed unconcerned. I told her I was waiting for her and she was clueless about everything we discussed. I explained to her that it was better for me to go out with her today rather than yesterday, as I learned last minute that my friend group wanted to hangout, hence why I offered to reschedule, to which, again, she was very positive about. She got mad at me for that explanation and insisted I prioritised my friends over her.\n\nWhile I understand where she comes from, I still don't understand which she would switch her mood just a day later. I even tried to apologize for trying to reschedule, but she said that she doesn't trust me in regards to hanging out again and I don't know how to move forwards with her in terms of our friendship.\n\nTL, DR: I rescheduled a hangout with my friend for the next day, acts clueless about said rescheduling and gets mad at me about it.\n\nUPDATE: I apologize to everyone who has read the post as I didn't provide all the necessary information due to my stomach sickness.\n\nSaid friend and my friend group are completely unrelated. There were no plans of a relationship from either side. While I rescheduled our plans, she was the one to suggest it because I woke up really late and I rescheduled with her knowing I had other plans.Also, to answer someone's question, this is the first time as far as I'm aware that I showed unreliability.\nI apologize for any possible conflicts with previous information. I was more focused on my stomach sickness and didn't think properly about the post itself like I should have.",

      "post_title": "AITA for putting my laundry in an open dryer before another resident's load was finished washing?",
      "scenario_description": "I had just moved out of my college dorm and into my first apartment. \n\nI lived on the 2nd floor, which didn’t have a washer/dryer, so I had to carry my laundry to one of the other floors. I used to try doing laundry in the basement, but the machines were often broken or the coins were jammed, so I stopped trying to go down there. Instead, I would go up one floor at a time until I found an open washer.\n\nI ended up on the 5th floor and at the time, someone else’s clothes were already in the dryer, but usually by the time the washer finishes, the dryer is empty and free to use. The washer and dryer cycles were usually around 45 minutes.\n\nWhen I came back 45 minutes later, my clothes were done but the dryer was still going. So I set a timer for 15 min and went back to my room. When I came back and it was STILL going I assumed the person before me ran the dryer for an additional cycle because it wasn’t dry.\n\nI decided I needed to find another dryer since I had to leave for work within the next hour or so. So I go up one more floor, and notice that there's an open dryer, but the washing machine is in use. I made sure to check what cycle it was on, and it was on the very first stage (Soak). If it was on any other stage I would have kept going up to find a different floor. But since it looked like it had just started, I decided to put my clothes in to dry. I figured by the time the washer was done, the dryer would either be done or close to done and it wouldn't be too big of an issue.\n\nWhen I came to get my dried clothes, I noticed the following note on top of the dryer:\n\n    I find it very disrespectful to put your clothes in FRONT of a washing maching in-use. I now have to wait for your clothes to dry because you thought yours was more important. Have a great day. -Fellow resident\n\nI was honestly pretty peeved by this. I’ve always tried to be respectful when using the shared laundry spaces, and I really felt like I took reasonable steps to make sure I wasn’t stepping on anyone’s toes. That said, I might be the asshole for writing a note back to them (though I’m not sure if they ever saw it). I wrote:\n\n    Sorry you found me using an OPEN dryer disrespectful. Your clothes were still on soak/wash stage. Sometimes you have to wait... I had to wait to dry my previous load because someone wanted to dry theirs twice. If you need it dried so badly, there are 9 floors!\n\nWhenever I think back on it, I wonder if there’s different etiquette for shared laundry when the machines are spread across different floors like this. Technically it’s still shared, but if a machine is open on other floors, especially since there are 0 machines on the floor I lived on, is it fair game? My only previous experience with shared laundry was in my college dorm, where all the machines were in a single room and you just took whichever one was free.\n\nSo AITA for putting my laundry in an open dryer before another resident's load was finished washing?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "This past weekend my (27F) boyfriend (29M) of 6 years and I went out to the closest grocery store to grab some ingredients to make lunch and dinner for the day. Before leaving, I asked if he had his wallet because we both share a credit account that is dedicated to our food expenses, paid via a shared account that we both contribute equally towards. He confirmed he had the shared credit card, so I declared I wasn't bringing my phone- which usually contains my ID and credit cards. It was the weekend. We were at a grocery store 10 minutes away from home. All I was planning to grab was some fruit and chips. \n\nHe decided to stop by the liquor store first, which is right next to the grocery store. I went in with him. I failed to realize that upon going to the checkout with him, they asked for both of our IDs. I stated I didn't have mine, and the cashier glanced at me and asked for my age. I told her my age, but she apologized and said she couldn't do the sale. I rightfully agreed and apologized to my boyfriend for not having my ID, saying I should have just waited in the car. He was a little upset. \n\nOn the way to the grocery store, he called me weird, suspicious, and immature for not having brought my phone. I told him it's the weekend and I wasn't expecting anyone to call/text me, and that I can live without my phone for an hour. And since I had confirmed he brought his wallet before leaving the house, there was truly no need for me to bring my phone/wallet combo. He stated that it's 2025 and everyone carries a phone- what if we got separated in the grocery store and needed to find each other? I commented that we would find each other eventually, just like I did before I owned a cell phone when I got lost as a 10 year old in a Costco warehouse. \n\nSo, AITA for not carrying my phone on my person all the time?

      "scenario_description": "Obligatory: this is a throwaway, I’m on mobile, my formatting is probably shit, and I’m furious right now and also feeling a bit guilty so I apologize if this is a bit all over the place.  I’m gonna do my best. \n\nAdditionally, I was very wordy in my first post and accidentally went over 3k characters. (sorry mods 😭) I will provide additional context if requested.\n\n\nI (33F) go up to visit my brother (14m) about twice a year. He and I are really close, and I’m sad that he lives far away because he’s entering high school this year. I just went up for the weekend, and got back home last night. This trip, she found out that my husband and I bought a second vehicle so my husband and I didn’t have to share a single vehicle with conflicting work schedules (public transport isn’t reliable here).\n\nShe messages me as I’m getting ready to walk into work this morning and says that we need to have a conversation about “my student loans.” She can’t pay her $65/mo parent plus loan and that’s going to affect my brother.  I told her to apply for another forbearance, to call DepEd, to call a senator.  She immediately replied that she has been denied a forbearance extension, DepEd wouldn’t help her, and Senator couldn’t give any advice. (I’m not sure I believe she actually did any of these things.)\n\nI told her that the reason we have these things is that both adults in my household are working despite both of us being disabled (me with MS & my husband is a veteran), and then sent her a link to indeed. I then told her I had to go to work and to have a nice day.  She responded that she had to go to a food line to be able to feed my brother and to have a nice day.\n\nMy brother is old enough that he doesn’t need childcare. He can stay home alone if she and his dad are both at work. She would lose her Medicaid benefits and EBT if she got a job, but… if she got a job she wouldn’t need it?  Losing state-funded health insurance is the only con I can see to her getting her job, but with the recent news of Medicaid cuts, she might lose them anyway.\n\nSo… AITA for essentially telling her to get a fucking job???\n\nEdited to add: \n\nThis is quickly devolving into “JUST PAY THEM GOD YOU’RE SUCH AN AWFUL DAUGHTER. YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL.”  If I needed someone to tell me what an awful daughter I was, I would’ve just asked my mom.  I’m not grateful. I wish I would’ve taken out Sallie Mae loans instead of giving her yet another thing to hold over me and demand of me. \n\nMy question was if I was an asshole for telling her to get a job.  Because I did truly feel bad about it, and the way I went about telling her to get a job. \n\nI don’t care if I’m TA for not paying a loan she took out in her name to “save me” from Sallie Mae. That was her choice. I cared if I took it too far by implying “well if you’ve done all these things, I guess getting a job is your only other option.” ",

If she’s struggling, there’s nothing wrong with her asking for help, but there’s also nothing wrong with you declining, especially when you have a much larger student loan payment of your own. Your response was maybe a bit harsh — you could have just said you’re not in a position to help her out, and I can see why she would not be willing to lose Medicaid to get a minimum wage job that probably won’t come with health insurance. Still, this is ultimately her problem to figure out and she shouldn’t have taken out the loan if she couldn’t afford it. ",

I watch her and we hang out at least once a week, I have taken her swimming, amusement parks, aquariums… etc. This past weekend I took her on a real hike for the first time. I told both her moms where we were going, I didn’t give times for when we would be back as I didn’t know how long the hike would take, I have watched her all day before though and everything has always gone great. When we got down from the hike and drove back into cell service I received a barrage of angry messages from both of them about why I wasn’t responding and what I was doing with their daughter. I told them we were on our way back now and I was going to get her dinner and that there wasn’t any cell service. They told me they would be feed her and to bring her home immediately. When I brought her back I got glares and side eyes from them, they wanted to talk but I was honestly upset at the damper this had out on our great day so I told them we could talk later and I left.\n\nI understand being worried about her up in the mountains but I am struggling to see what I could/should have done differently? I’ll talk to them soon but wanted to hear what you all think?",

      "scenario_description": "I (18F) live at home and split time between my divorced parents — about 3 weeks with each. Lately, my mom and I have been getting into frequent small arguments, and I’m starting to feel overwhelmed.\n\nWe’ve always clashed a bit. My mom can be really controlling: she wants to know every detail when I go out, constantly reminds me about things I already do (like flossing), and is really strict about money. When I had a children's bank account, she would literally check it daily and question me about any spending. She has a decent income, owns a nice apartment, and her parents (my grandparents) are wealthy, so I don’t fully understand why she’s so stressed about money all the time.\n\nOne recurring fight is over how long I shower. I wash my hair twice a week, which takes me around 25–30 minutes total. I even turn the water off while conditioner or a hair mask is sitting — a habit I actually learned from her! Still, she knocks on the door to complain, saying I take too long. Today it happened again, and we got into another fight. She thinks 2-minute showers (sometimes even without soap!) are fine, and worries about the water bill.\n\nI’ve told her that I’m not being wasteful and that I literally can’t shower faster given my routine. When I bring up how she’s being too controlling, she gets defensive and says she’s just being a normal parent. I’ve also told her that I’d rather live more with my dad since he’s much more relaxed and not so critical — but I can tell that hurts her feelings. She gets sad when I say stuff like that, and I don’t want to upset her, but I also feel like I have a right to speak up since I spend so much time living with her.\n\nSo... AITA for calling her controlling and saying I’d rather live with my dad?",

      "scenario_description": "So here's the story. My husband (46M) and I (44F) are super proud of our son (16M) who is going to start at UMD this fall semester. I won't use real names for privacy reasons so we'll call my husband Trevor and our son Ashton. For some context Ashton's got some prior credits so he was able to get ahead in college. He's also learning how to drive and is preparing for his provisional license so he has it for the upcoming semester. We live about an hour away from campus and traffic may usually bring a commute to up to an hour and 30 minutes.\n\nHowever I'm in a pickle about his housing. Since he was younger I've discouraged Ashton from staying in the dorms because I don't want him doing anything foolish (i.e. going to parties, getting drunk, or doing other things behind my back). Plus money may be an issue. He and I want to avoid college debt as much as possible. He is also a little irresponsible at times and fears about living independently or with roommates, so I'm worried about him living away from home. However, Ashton's friends and former classmates have been telling him for the past few months about living on campus. He recently attended orientation a few weeks back and felt alright with the dorms (he wasn't overjoyed, though he's made comments about being surprised to be alive). But now that I think about it I still do not let him in the dorms.\n\nNow my son is pondering a little bit about being on campus especially with this newfound influence. He is pacing around the house and is now searching up the different dorms they have for undergrad students. I think he may be in conflict with me but he is hiding his thoughts. As we stated before we are still going to make him drive back and forth to the school, but if he is not comfortable with driving, Trevor said he will gladly offer to drive him back and forth. It's a bit too late now for housing for the fall so this issue has been on my mind recently. AITA?",

Commuting three hours a day he’s not going to have time to participate in extracurriculars and student organizations, which are also really important. If you’re worried about his ability to live independently, that’s exactly why he needs to learn to do so now in a somewhat sheltered and lower-stakes environment.

This day, in particular, he seemed excited about needing to leave when we got back to my house because he was tired and wanted to go home and sleep for work the next day. I have his location and consistently since the beginning of our relationship, I’ve checked his location to make sure he gets home safe. \nThis time, one location app said his phone died and another one said it was turned off 30 minutes in the wrong direction of his house. I waited till it was 2 and a half hours after he should’ve gotten home, before contacting his mom, who he lives with, and his sister because they would be able to see if he got home or not. \n\nThey confirmed he wasn’t home. After almost 6 hours(1 AM), I drove to the last location that was 30 minutes away. I found his car, at a random person’s apartment, and he even heard my car going off when I was getting in and out of my car to grab my phone. \n\nHis sister calls me because she has my location and saw me driving. I tell her that I found his car. Then his mom messages me about his license plate coming up, a block from where I ended up finding him, and I told her I found him. \nHis sister and mom then tell him that they were grateful that I feel comfortable to reach out to them but I should only reach out once I have exhausted all options of finding him. \nSo, AITA for contacting them about my bf not getting home when he said he would?",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nhi reddit, so I have a neighbor who seems to have a real problem with our 2 small dogs existing anywhere near them. we moved into a duplex about 2 years ago now. we have a conjoined side yard of gravel between our unit and the next duplex unit on the street. This space is around 7-8ft wide. we currently have a small wire fence up about 3ft wide to allow our dogs out the side door to use the bathroom on the gravel instead of on our grass.\n\nwhen we moved in the neighbor rudely tried to demand we move it, no explanation to us other than him not approving the dogs being allowed to use the bathroom \"so close\" to their space. we checked with local bylaws and there is no problem with it. Neighbor proceeded to call animal control on us numerous times to accuse us of having an accumulation of animal feces. Bylaw enforcement came by and assured us we are doing a perfectly acceptable job cleaning it and there is no issue with the location. This back and forth has gone on for over a year now of vindictive calls and reports and various other acts against us as we just stayed in our lane. \n\nneighbor has now suddenly informed us that \"the real reason they didnt want it near their house is their son has CF and says this can increase infection risk\" this was never mentioned to us, no compromise was ever offered just a demand that we move it to our back yard. I am unfamiliar with what risk this would actually pose so any information on that is also welcome. For context it is at least 10 ft from our side door pen up to their front door, we clean the pen every 2-3 days and both dogs are fully vaccinated and do not attend dog parks to increase their risk of any infections. We do not have a good section to block off in the backyard for this purpose and it would likely cost us a fair amount of money to revamp our back space to work for this.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I apologize for the inconvenience but leave it as is as it is a fully acceptable way to use our own space according to all bylaws",
