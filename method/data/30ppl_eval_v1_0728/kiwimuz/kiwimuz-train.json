      "scenario_description": "For context, my brother is an addict. He’s been homeless since 2017. I was able to get him out of his situation and helped him by paying money to get him back home. He lived with me for a while in 2021 until he decided he didn’t like living by my rules (keep going to therapy, no drugs, no alcohol, communicate, be respectful) etc, he had agreed to all this when he decided to stay with me. He relapsed and while I understand it’s a disease, I tried to work with him to get him back on track. That wasn’t enough. He started coming home later and later every single day. I woke up early for work and would have to wait until almost midnight to make sure that he could get inside the house. This became such an issue and it was definitely getting to me.\n\nWe had gotten into a huge fight and he left. This was in October 2021. For almost 4 years I’ve had zero contact with my brother. He has not called, he has not come by. I truly assumed the worst had happened to him. I had tried calling every homeless shelter in our area. I had done a lot to try to find him. Yesterday, I get a phone call. My phone was on silent because I work from home and I always keep my phone on silent while I’m working and face down so that I can focus. I’ve gotten up to go to the kitchen and when I came back, I checked my phone and saw that I had several missed calls And a voicemail. It was my brother. I called the number back and find out that he had been arrested because there was a warrant out for his arrest from 2022 when he stole from a grocery store and was in possession of something else, the lady told me that he was being transferred to a different facility and that his bond was set at $300. I was enraged after the phone call and had mixed emotions about this because on one hand I have not heard from my brother in almost 4 years and this is the time that he decides to call me is when he needs help? I don’t feel like I want to pay his bond, for what? So that he can go back to doing drugs? It makes me really sad that he’s had almost 4 years to try to make amends and talk to me, and the only time he reaches out to me is when he needs something from me. AITA for not wanting to pay his bond? ",

      "scenario_description": "I just had a baby last week and my mom and stepdad are visiting for a month to help with the new baby and toddler which I am very grateful for.  My stepdad is able to work from home. He sits in our kitchen all day and takes zoom calls, all of which are in loud volume so everyone can hear all 4-5 people on the call talk about engineering - stepdad also speaks very loudly. Our house isn’t very big and it is open concept, so the kitchen, dining room and living room are essentially one room with no walls dividing them. They’ve stayed with us in the past and taken these calls and I’ve passively asked him if he has headphones to which he replied he didn’t. The next time he visited, he apologized and said he forgot the headphones again. This time, he hasn’t said anything about headphones at all and is just letting it rip. Stepdad has also asked my toddler to “shhh” while he is on these calls even though he knows he is sitting 3 feet from the play area.  My husband, who my stepdad generally has a great relationship with, is also annoyed by this and finally nicely mentioned using headphones again or using the guest room my parents are staying in which has a desk in it. Stepdad proceeds to act hurt and packs up his laptop, notepads, etc to move into the guest room. My husband tells him he can still work there, but just to move if there are calls. Stepdad still decides to take all of his things and moves into the guest room with door closed for the remainder of the day - the energy feels tense. Are we TAs here?",

      "scenario_description": "For some context, I (22m) have divorced parents. My mother still relies solely on my father for everything (housing, food, etc.) the main issue is that my step mom does not like that he will send her extra money on top of the monthly check he gives her when things come up, (ie. Car troubles, hospital bills, etc) so he will send me money to give to her so that she doesn’t find out.\n\nThis week my dad gave me money to take her car to the mechanic and have the registration renewed. When I asked my mom how much the total was going to be, she told me to give everything he sent me to her. I told her I wanted to get an exact number so that I didn’t overcharge my dad, and she flipped out over the phone, hung up on me, and proceeded to send me some really nasty texts about being too“protective” of my dad.\n\nI still sent her a good portion of the money he gave me, and told her I wasn’t going to argue with her and let her know that I would send the rest when I have a total amount. The total ended up being way more than my dad had guessed, because she had gotten a couple traffic tickets that she never payed for. But she used this as an opportunity to degrade my dad to my face.\n\nSo, I told her that she was being childish and that if she wanted to act like this she’s more than welcome to find a way to pay it herself. I then blocked her on everything. My sister (25f) called me and told me I was being an asshole for not helping my mom out. \n\nSo AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (32F) feel stuck between my husband (34M) and my family, and I don’t know if I handled this the right way.\n\nMy brother (30s) has always been the golden child in my mom’s eyes. He has several kids but barely parents them. My mom (60s) watches his children constantly while he sleeps, plays video games, or just disappears. Any time someone brings up how unfair this is, she makes excuses like “he’s just tired” or “he’s doing his best.” He rarely shows up to help, and everyone is expected to tiptoe around it.\n\nRecently things got worse. My husband owns his own business and works hard to provide for our family. After a dumb disagreement with my brother, my brother actually threatened my husband’s business. Like straight-up said he’d mess with it. Not even in a joking way.\n\nThen, he demanded my husband return the furniture we had bought and given him. This was stuff we purchased to help him when he was going through a tough time. It wasn’t a loan. It was a gift. But suddenly he was acting like we owed him something.\n\nSo yeah - my husband got mad. He made a comment about how my brother doesn’t do anything, never helps with his own kids, and how my mom constantly enables him. It was honest. Maybe a little harsh, but not inaccurate.\n\nI didn’t say anything. I didn’t defend my brother because honestly, my husband was right. I’ve felt that way for years but always kept quiet to avoid drama.\n\nLater, my mom pulled me aside and told me I should have stood up for my brother. She said I let my husband “disrespect family” and accused me of changing since I got married. She made me feel like I betrayed them by not taking my brother’s side.\n\nNow I feel completely torn. My husband is working hard, doing his part, and constantly getting disrespected. But my mom acts like I should cover for my brother no matter what.\n\nSo, AITA for not defending my brother when my husband called him out?\n\n\nEDIT- seeing a lot of people thinking I didn’t defend my husband, I left that part out bc I didn’t need judgement on if I was TA for doing that. My family and I haven’t spoke since this happened and I definitely had a screaming match with my mother after this happened. ",

      "scenario_description": "My dad owns two houses: the one he lives in, and one left to him by his grandparents. My older sister “Carrie” (F26) and I (F24) rent the other house. We’ve lived there for almost 2 years. \n\nA few months ago, my sister and I (with our parents permission) asked one of our cousins “Mary” (F24) to move in as we have an extra room. Mary was going through a hard time and had just gotten divorced and had no place to stay. She moved in shortly after. All three of us pay an equal amount of rent. \n\nShortly after Mary moved in, she started essentially harassing my sister and I, trying to get us to go to church with her, as she is a devout evangelical christian. She would try to guilt trip us and make comments anytime we did something “sinful”, and even though we asked her to stop multiple times, she didn’t. \n\nIt eventually got so bad that my sister and I told Mary that if she didn’t stop bringing up religion completely, we were going to have to ask her to find somewhere else to live as she was creating a hostile environment. \n\nMary told her dad that we “threatened her” and her dad told my mom, who said we were not allowed to kick Mary out as she is family and “just wants what is best” for us. \n\nMary got even WORSE after this, and Carrie and I began to notice that she was throwing away our stuff that she thought was “demonic” which is what pushed us over the edge. \n\nCarrie and I secretly looked for somewhere else to live, and we ended up finding a new place that we can actually buy. We decided to do it, and broke the news to Mary, as we will be leaving in about 2 weeks. \n\nMary FREAKED the fuck out since she can’t afford to rent the house on her own, and told our parents. My dad says we’re allowed to do what we want, but my mom is super angry, saying we are leaving Mary to live on the street, and a bunch of bs about how we’ve let the devil get to us. \n\nAre me and my sister assholes? I feel a little bad for Mary but also feel like she deserves it. ",

She's my wife's sister and we tend to see each other at least once a month for family events.\n\nFor my wife and I, we manage our kids ourselves.  If we go somewhere, one of us is always keeping an eye on them, making sure they're not getting into trouble - especially making sure the youngest (a toddler) is safe - changing her if necessary, refilling her sippy cup, stuff like that.  Its our job.  If something happens, one of us pops up and takes care of it.\n\nSIL and her husband take a different approach and are frequently asking for help.  If we're all eating dinner and their kid has a poopy diaper, they'll sometimes get it, sometimes turn to one of us and ask \"would you mind?\"  The other day, I'm at a party and just came back inside after getting something for my kids, ready to sit down to eat and SIL asks \"\\[Baby\\] left her sippy cup upstairs - would you mind getting it?\"  Her and her husband both sitting down and perfectly capable.  It's not like they've asked a few times when they're overwhelmed or there's only one of them - there's been times one of them is lying on a couch reaching a book and ask me for something.\n\nIt's not like what they ask for anything I'd consider a huge inconvenience, so I feel petty saying something - but part of me just wants to say \"Look, my wife and I are responsible for our kids - you're responsible for yours.  I don't ask you to change our kids' diapers or grab their sippy cups from the next room, don't ask me.\"  WIBTA?\n\n",

The beds in 2 of the 3 are spoken for so that leaves 1 bed and a living room couch. I just don’t see how this would even remotely be feasible, much less comfortable for everyone. Not to mention, both I and my son both have to work while they’re here, so we have to be up & moving in the mornings. Whoever would end up on the couch is gonna be miserable with us hustling to get breakfast and get out the door. \n\nIf we had more space, or a finished basement, or even convent room for air mattresses I wouldn’t mind them staying here.

And yesterday, when I was not home, my cat jumped in the desk and the TV fell off, it's not repairable and she'll buy a new one, but she wants me to pay for it. She said that it's my fault since the the cat is mine, but it would not fall of the desk if it was in the right place, THE WALL. I think it's not my fault and she knows it will be tight to pay the TV she wants and pay the bills since I don't get much money from work.\n\nEdit: Hey guys, thanks for your opinion. We talked about it and made a deal, she'll pay half of the TV, and I'll pay the other half. After all, it's my cats fault and I'm responsible for her, after all, she's used to sleep in high places and I should have tough her to not climb things in our house.

      "scenario_description": "I really need outside opinions because I don’t know if I am being super unreasonable.\n\nMy mum died when I was a teenager. In her will, she left the house to me but gave my dad a right to live in it until he dies. She inherited our family home from her parents so it was always just in her name.\n\nHonestly I never thought of it as “my house.” Even though legally it is. I moved away for uni but after I got a good job back in our hometown, I moved back in. I have been living here again for a few years now. \n\nI guess I knew deep down that my dad must have dated over the years but he never talked about it and never introduced me to anyone and honestly I kind of liked it that way. I didn't want to know that he moved on. It was just us- him and me against the world.\n\nHis new girlfriend kind of appeared out of nowhere. I met her a couple of times and suddenly she moved in without any prior discussion. \n\nI was stunned but I tried to be happy for him. I really, really did. I tried my best to be polite and keep my resentment to myself. But it’s getting harder every single day. Every time I see them giggling in the kitchen or cuddled up on the sofa my mum picked out, I want to scream. My mum who died too young, who loved my dad, who was only ever with my dad, who never got a chance to move on. And now I have to watch him do it, every single day, in her house, in her childhood home. I didn't know I just feels like this is so disrespectful to my mum's memory.\n\nShe is redecorating. She has moved furniture. She changed the curtains and wallpapers my mum and I picked together and reorganised the kitchen cupboards.\n\nAnd worse she has been making comments like, “Have you ever thought about living independently now that you are settled in your career?” Or telling my dad they will need to turn my room into nursery eventually when they have kids as the third room is his home office.\n\nLike. What?? The absolute audacity.\n\nI’m not a tenant or a guest. I own the goddamn house. My dad just has a right to live here but I don't think that right gives him the right to just move in a partner and act like it’s their shared marital home especially when I live here too. If he wants to build a life with her he should at least move out and not do it in my mum's home.\n\nFrom what i understand she has no legal right to live here. She is not a tenant as she pays no rent. I think I can legally kick her out anytime i want to without a court order. At best she is an \"excluded occupier\" and can be evicted with reasonable notice which is classed as one rental period. And I don't think even that is applicable here.\n\nI havent confronted him yet but I am this close to sitting my dad down and saying all this. And if he refuses, I am considering speaking to a solicitor and making it happen formally. I know it would cause a huge rift but i am so tired of feeling like a stranger in my own home. I feel like my mum is being erased. But I really love my dad and don't want to hurt him or lose him",

      "scenario_description": "My (22) mother (60) was diagnosed with brain cancer last year after having some health issues for a while. Since she was unable to work, I was the provider for the house together with the money from my grandma's (90) pension. I had always told my mother that I couldn't take care of her, since I've been dealing with depression for the most of my life, taking care of myself and others is a challenge, and I thought it would be dangerous to place her care entirely upon me. I offered to pay for a nurse to take care of her and pay for the house expenses for the time we lived together, offer she apparently was okay with. She had always been pretty manipulative, acting like the victim and never taking the blame for anything, like for example, telling my family that I left university because I wanted to go to the most expensive option, when in reality it was because of harassment.\n\nIn january, it was decided that it would be better if she moved to the capital with her brother and my grandma for better treatment opportunities, so I was forced to move out of the apartment we were renting and to an smaller one with our two dogs, living alone for the first time in my life. She gave me around 300 usd from her savings in case I had to travel to see her, but she asked me to buy her some things off amazon with her money and in the end there was only 250 left. She lives in her brother's house now, with rent, electricity and food paid for, but she stills wants me to give her money monthly to \"pay for extra expenses\". I've told her to ask her brother for them, since those are basic things like bread and pads (there is food in the house, it's just not the type she likes). When I told her I had many things to pay on my side and that I couldn't give her money, she lashed at me and told me it was selfish of me, that I was being childish and that I was in the wrong. She told me to never speak to her again and just give her back her 250, money which I used in an emergency and I hadn't been able to replace. Now, she's sending messages to my dad, who had been out of the picture for my whole life, my friends and everyone she has contact with, crying and asking them to tell me to talk to her again, telling them that her tumor is getting worse and that she's gonna die. I've stood my ground in wanting her to apology for lashing out to me and calling me all the names in the book, since she has never apologized to me in my life. A friend is telling me that I should call her and fix the issue, but it feels like going back to the same situation where I just do anything she wants.\n\nAITA for refusing to apologize first?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi everyone! I (22F) bought my first car a couple of months ago. I’ve had my drivers license for about 3,5 years so before getting my own car I used to borrow my moms or my grandmas car if public transport wasn’t an option. So a few weeks ago in june my mom wanted to borrow my car, which of course was fine. My car can pull her caravan, her own car can’t so we switched cars for the weekend. Saturday afternoon she called me: she had lost my key and asked me if I could bring the spare one. She was only 15 minutes away, so fine, I went. The day went on and Sunday morning I went to see her. When I was there, someone returned my car key to my mom. She was very happy it was found, but this was also the moment she decided to tell me that she also lost my spare key. MY car keys, TWO in 24 HOURS… I ofcourse was not happy to hear she had lost the second key in only a day.\n\nFlash forward to Sunday evening, she told me that she found the key, drove my car home and LOST IT AGAIN. THIRD key in two days. I am really pissed off at this, so that was also the moment that I decided for myself that I would not lend my car to my mom anymore. (I should add here that the key was found again, so I still have both keys)\n\nI feel like I’m the asshole because my mom keeps telling me I’m overreacting. Am I? She told me she was under a lot of stress that weekend, which I totally get. But for me thats valid if she had lost it once, but three times??? My grandma took her side, because they let me use their cars for years before I got my own. Which I’m very grateful for!\n\nAlso, my mom has gotten to the point where I can’t even borrow a hat or something small out of spite.\n\nAm I overreacting?\n\nPs, please excuse any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.",

We’re close friends so I said yes but that id need it by the morning to get to school. The next day she didn’t return my bike and I was late to school, having to catch a later bus as I expected her to swing by and drop off my bike. Three days ago she finally returned the bike with scratches all over it. Obviously i was pissed so i got mad at her, demanding to know why my bike was all scratched considering when i lended it to her it was in good condition. \n\nYesterday morning she texted and called, practically begging to borrow my bike for the coming night, I said no. She insisted on borrowing it again, and when I refused, she stopped answering my texts. \n\nThis morning I woke up to find my bike missing (It’s usually kept by the side of my house behind a gate, the gate doesn’t lock but it’s been like that for a year and a half and we live in a safe neighbourhood). I immediately called her, but she didn’t answer. I caught the bus to school again, once again late.\n\nLater that evening, she still wasn’t answering my messages, so I told my mother. I asked my mum for her parents numbers and told them what she had been doing; sneaking off behind their back, hanging out with her boyfriend and smoking weed. She called me later that night fuming, saying we weren’t friends anymore.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My 13 year old step son’s mother bought him a puppy over the weekend. Awesome! It was our weekend with our son when they picked him up and he asked if he could bring him over to our house for his younger siblings to meet him. We said OK but only for a bit outside because I am mildly allergic.  In addition, we don’t want to be responsible for an animal with our hectic lives. After the puppy left, my step son said he will need to bring the dog over when his mom is “too busy” to watch him because the dog is his responsibility. I said we won’t be able to do that and explained why for the reasons above. I thought it was settled. Today, during her parenting time, she dropped him off because she has a doctor’s appointment and can’t watch him. I told my husband this is a slippery slope and he needs to tell her she can’t drop off the dog anymore unless she gets direct permission from my husband (but would prefer to not allow it at all) My step son didn’t like that and thinks I’m being unreasonable. As a side note- my husband and his ex-wife don’t have an amicable relationship.",

However he recently decided he wanted a gecko and a snake. I personally don’t like reptiles and he has had a previous lizard and a snake who died bc he didn’t care for them. I told him I wasn’t comfortable but he still went and got a gecko behind my back. I was mad but eased into the idea of it cause it made him happy and he swore he would care for it this time around. But I told him straight up that I did not want a snake. Fast forward one week later he gets a snake behind my back while I stay at a friends house for a couple of days and find out when I get home. I feel so disrespected and feel like he took advantage of the fact that I came to terms with his lizard. We already have  two dogs. Additionally his family knew I didn’t want him to get a snake and he went with his brother to pick it up so now his family is aware of the disrespect too. ",

We already had the design and all the details finalized months ahead, but 3 months before the wedding she casually showed me a picture of a wedding cake and told me that one of  her friend would be doing that cake for them instead. Not only did she completely change the cake design, but she also added other desserts on top of that. She didn’t even give an explanation or apologize as to why she suddenly has someone else do their cake. Ngl, i was extremely hurt as that was supposed to be my wedding gift for them and everyone in my family were already expecting me to make that cake. My brother’s fiancé told me i can help out with something else or that if i want, i can pay for something else instead as a wedding gift. I told her i’ll help them out as much as i could but i won’t commit to something that’s out of my budget. \n\nA month before the wedding, her friend that was supposed to make their cake messaged me and asked me(and all my baker friends) if she can borrow my baking supplies as she’s from a different place and doesn’t really have anything to use for her baking. She said she doesn’t want to buy just for that one event. I’m not selfish by any means but i just can’t comprehend as to why i have to go through all the trouble packing all my stuff and asking my friends if i can borrow their stuff as well. It’s just a bit of a slap in the face knowing that she asked someone to make their cake and then have them use my stuff.  AITA if i say no to sharing my stuff or should i be the bigger person and just let it all go??\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for not wanting to carpool anymore?\n\nAbout 7 months ago, I started working at a company where I met a teammate who lives on the same road I take to work (takes me 45mins without traffic). We started carpooling, where I would be at her house at nearly 7 am. However, she usually would still be asleep by the time I get to her house. so, because I did not like being late to work, I started calling her 15 minutes earlier so she would get ready. However, she would still get late. Mind you she paid me an agreed amount the beginning of each month. \n\n\nThat did not bother me until she started going to work on some days with this other coworker whom she liked \"for fun\" although he clearly had feelings for her. She would not always tell me when she'll be coming with me and I had to call her every morning, which I did jot like doing. moreover, she would not be ready on my days, but i catch her ready early whenever she has to go with him (he gets to work at 9am while I do at 8am) which I really did not like. and it started really bothering me...\n\nTo add more spice to the story, the dude had an accident and wanted to fix his car, so she would need a ride. she did not tell me that, she masked it with a little hint of \"i missed you, i think i will be coming with you now on\" which upset me the most.\n\nNow after that happened I decided to stop the carpool thing, and I told her I don't want that to ruin our friendship, and she said \"what you did is really shitty and I don't want to be friends with you anymore\" to which I replied \"yeah okay whatever u want\"\n\nNow, I don't know how the whole situation would be from her point of view, but i can't see in what way she'd make me out to be a bad friend... because that's what she told our teammates at work\n\nCould you please give me some insight? it is bothering me because I feel like im the one wronged here",

      "scenario_description": "Ok, so I (49f) was on vacation with my husband (51m) my son(18m) and son’s gf(18f). We were in Bermuda, where wild chickens are kind of everywhere. \n\nWe went to one of those touristy attractions so the kids could do a tour. Hubby and I have toured this attraction enough over the years so we just gave the kids a ride and were waiting outside.\n\nBefore the tour started, the staff directed us to sit under a tent and wait for the guide. There were a few chickens about. A couple of hens had very young chicks. Other people showed up and seemed to like the chickens but weren’t interested in them.\n\nThen a family of five came. Mom and dad on their phones. Oldest son too cool for his siblings. Daughter (12ish) declared that she was going to catch a chick. I knew this was unlikely as they are good at disappearing in the brush.  Well, daughter got too close and the mother hen squawked and jumped at her. This upset the youngest son(10ish) who started chasing the hen, swinging a stick at her. She was clearly panicking and desperately trying to get away.  \n\nI immediately rushed over (as I was on my way, the kid threw the stick at the hen) and told him not to throw things at animals. Then told him to go to his parents. I was very firm in my statement.\n\nI returned to my family as the kid’s father was asking him if he threw something at an animal. Since the kid denied it, I said, “Yeah, he just threw a stick at a chicken.” \n\nThe dad didn’t say word one to the kid about his actions. Instead, he snapped at me saying, “we’re his parents!” Indicating himself and the kids’ apparent mom. \n\nSo I replied, “Good. Then parent.” I admit I was matching his tone. He just shook his head and said “wow” over and over in a really angry tone. \n\nI felt that I was right to address the situation directly with the child as it was quickly escalating into violence and I was sincerely concerned for the safety of that mom and her babies. But was I TA? Should I have asked the parents to notice and prevent their kid’s actions?",

      "scenario_description": "A little backstory for context: I unfortunately fell into drug use at the age of 14 and have struggled to maintain sobriety until my sister fell pregnant and her daughter was born. That was a year and a half ago and since then I have not used because my sister gave me an ultimatum. The ultimatum was that I either choose drugs, our I choose to be in my nieces life. Obviously I choose the latter! That ultimatum ended up saving my life, so I feel in debt to my sister for that. \nAnyways, it has taken me a long time to gain back my family’s trust. Anybody who has gone through the early stages of getting sober knows that people will be suspicious of you and over analyze all of your behaviors, wondering if you’re high. Well, luckily, I have gotten past that stage and my relationship with my family is great. Especially with my sister. We are more like best friends than sisters these days. I get to see my family on a regular basis and things feel like they’re back to “normal”. \nOK, so this is where the conflict comes in… I have an aunt who does not yet fully believe that I am sober. We were texting and I sent her a text that was supposed to say “yes ma’am”, but instead it said “yes, mama”. All because of that, she believes that I am back on drugs. I told my sister about the situation and she tells me well you do look high and I don’t blame our Aunt for thinking that. \nMy sister knows that this is a touchy subject for me. I’m very sensitive to how people perceive me. I work so hard at my recovery that when people don’t believe me, I do feel a little bit of heartache and she of all people knows that. \nI went completely silent, packed up my bag and told her I have to go. I said I’m not mad at you, but I feel so hurt and don’t want to stick around to hear anymore negative comments. \nMy mother overheard the conversation and said that I was being childish and that I should just get over it and continue to spend the day with my sister like I had planned. I didn’t listen and I left. I told them I love them before I close the door to let them know that I am not angry. \nThey are very angry with me now and I don’t understand why. \nSo, am I the asshole for leaving my sister’s house when we had plans after she agreed with my aunt and said I looked high? \n",

      "scenario_description": "I 35F was scheduled to go on a camping trip with my older brother his 2 daughters age 12 and 14 and my younger sister in 12 days. My younger sister 30F booked the camping site and we all paid our share to her 101 each. My sister had decided not to bring her dog or invite my younger brother and his 3 young kids ages 2-6 because she did not want to spend her vacation babysitting,she wanted to drink and relax. My older brother and I agreed as we both work high stress jobs and just really need a break. That brings us to today my sister calls me and informs me that my 6 year old niece will be joining us and that we will be baby sitting her for the trip. I am now considering dropping out of the trip for a few reasons, one I feel blindsided that my sister offered to bring our niece along without consulting anyone first. Also I know she did not contact my older brother about this as she knows he would not be okay with taking her. I adore my niece but babysitting her is really taxing she has severe ADHD and is prone to screaming fits when ever she is told no. So I feel that if I go on this trip it will absolutely not be the relaxing trip I have been looking forward to for months.\nWould I be the asshole if I tell my sister I will not be joining them for this trip?\n\nupdate: first of all thank you for the comments. I did want to clear a couple of things up my younger sister does not have any kids and the 6 year old as he is bringing is our youngest brothers kid. Many have pointed out that screaming fits is not a symptom of ADHD and that is correct her ADHD causes her to be hyper and really high energy the temper tantrums are a separate issue. I have not spoken to my sister yet as today is a holiday and I did not want to ruin it for anyone, but today she informed my brother that my niece will not be allowed to bring her tablet as my sister has decided this is a no electronics trip. This is a recipe.for disaster as my niece does not do well on long rides and usually uses her tablet. The ride to the campsite is 3 hours and my sister is expecting my niece to sit quietly. This was a conversation that she made sure to have while my older brother was out of earshot so I will be letting him know what she is planning and will not be going on this trip. My plan is to spend that time at a resort and spa instead",

      "scenario_description": "I’ll be out of state for a few months and will be storing my car while gone. I also possibly won’t need the car when I return. Right now, my brother (24 m) has no car or job but says a car will allow him to get around safely and get a job. I agree with that. But there’s a chance I’ll need the car again in the future and he doesn’t have the best driving record — been in two bad accidents in last 5 years. My plan was to sign over the title to him and if I need the car when I’m back, he signs it back. If not, he keeps it. I 100% trust he would give it back if asked to. It’s just his driving and I may need the car. He says he’s changed, sorry, and would only use it for work. It feels wrong to say no, I want to help my brother, I also don’t like him walking everywhere because of safety. But I finally decided to not give it to him because I’m scared of the “what ifs”. I really value my car. He’s saying I’m jeopardizing his safety over a material thing. AITA?\n\nEdit: Should clarify the accidents weren’t that serious, but both incidents the car needed major repairs. ",

      "scenario_description": "Back in February, I moved to a new place. A friend rented a car under his name to help me move some furniture because I don’t have a driver’s license. We did the move together, and then he drove off with two other friends to fill up the gas tank before returning the car. I stayed at the new apartment to unpack.\n\nLater that night, a speeding camera caught the car going 91 km/h in a tunnel with a limit of 80. (This is in Norway, where traffic laws are taken very seriously.) Four months later, he got the ticket in the mail: 5050 NOK (about $470 USD).\n\nThe timestamp on the ticket is 22:49, and the car wasn’t due until 23:30. The gas station was 15 minutes from the drop-off location, so there was no reason to speed. I wasn’t in the car anymore at that point.\n\nNow he’s asking me to pay the full fine. His reasoning is that he only rented the car to help me move, so I should take responsibility. I understand that he was doing me a favor and I really appreciated it — but I didn’t ask him to speed. It happened after the move, and I had nothing to do with the driving at that point.\n\nI offered to help with part of the fine — around 1500 NOK — as a thank-you for everything he did, but I don’t think I should be responsible for the whole thing.\n\nAITA for refusing to pay the entire amount?\n",

      "scenario_description": "I (33M) have been on my own since I was 16 years old. As a result, I was a homeless youth until I was 18. I worked hard, got a college scholarship, and now I'm a fairly successful self-employed software developer and have built a substantial amount of savings and recently bought a new home with cash. This was the result of a lot of financial discipline and hard work over several years. It was a lonely road because nobody in my family tried to help me, especially during the two years that I was in and out of homeless shelters. In fact, all of them refused to help because they disagreed with my \"lifestyle\". In case you need clarification, I'm a gay man and my family is deeply religious.\n\nRecently, my aunt (in her late 50's) called me out of the blue. She wanted to see if I'd be interested in having lunch with her. Because of how random it was, my head immediately went to \"oh, she's gonna pitch me an MLM\" cause it had all the hallmarks of an MLM pitch. But since we hadn't been in touch in over a decade, I wanted to see her. Surprisingly, we just had a normal lunch. And then she took me out for coffee and dessert...\n\nBut I knew she wasn't just doing this for shits and giggles. I know my aunt. I knew she wanted something and was trying to sweeten me up... So I cut to the chase and asked her point blank - why did you call me here? She did all this because my cousin (27M) needed help. What help? Financial help. He was knee deep in sports betting debt... and when I say knee deep, I mean \\~$50k deep. And to make matters worse, he was maxed on several credit cards totaling to \\~$35k. And that's not where it ended. He was also upside down on his car note (\\~$38k) was 2 payments behind (\\~$1,600). At 27 years old, this man child had managed to rack up over $100k in debt. My flabbers were absolutely gasted y'all.\n\nBut despite my ability to help, I flat out told her that I **won't** help.\n\nWhile I would love to say that I was being petty, it wasn't. The drama of the past is just that - the past. The actual reason why I refused to help was because I did not see how my money would actually help the situation long term. What's to say my cousin wasn't going to go right back into debt after I pay everything off for him? And then they were going to reach out to me again? I saw them do this to my eldest aunt (she also deaded the extended family like I did) and this eldest aunt was the one who warned me and told me to never ever get involved if I want to keep my sanity intact. My eldest aunt actually passed away a while ago and she donated all her money to her local public school's music program because she knew that money would actually be put to good use (rather than squandered by her siblings).\n\nAnyway, she went into this whole \"what would Jesus do\" nonsense and that's when I decided that I had enough. I wasn't going to let her use faith manipulation to get me to sign over a blank check. Everything about this situation was why I left the family in the first place. I told her to never call me again and left $100 to cover the food and coffee she bought me before I left because I had noticed she used her credit card to pay...\n\nDon't get me wrong. I do feel really bad. But this simply isn't my responsibility. And I was extremely hurt that after all these years, she only reached out to financially manipulate me.\n\nSo guys, AITA for refusing to financially help my younger cousin?",

      "scenario_description": "My (21M) dad died. It’s just me and my brothers (19M, 19M) and distant relatives. We have more family friends than we do close family so we try to value the family we do have when we get to see them. His funeral was yesterday.\n\nOur cousin Khalie (24F) lived with us for much of her life because her mom struggled (being a single mom and in and out of difficult situations). I wouldn’t say my dad solely raised her but he played a big part in it, so they were close but since she turned 21 or so she’s moved out of state and hasn’t really come around much. Fine.\n\nShe volunteered to make slideshows for the funeral. Great. One was going to be right before the eulogy and the other was going to be right after.\n\nUntil yesterday she didn’t mention having any scheduling conflicts, but then sprung on us that she was picking up her mom from the airport in the morning and might be late. Fine, whatever. She’d maybe miss most of the viewing.\n\nBut then she starts calling during the viewing saying they had to eat and would be 60-90 minutes late and asked if we could request pushing things back, mind you, everything was already in motion. I said maybe the order of events could be changed but there was too much going on and didn’t get a chance to talk to the funeral home so things proceeded as normal.\n\nI stopped answering her texts which she assumed meant things got moved around. She eventually arrived towards the end, missed most of everything, got pissy with me after, saying I was selfish and talking to the funeral home could have been quick and easy and now she and her mom(?) feel robbed.\n\nNow she’s ranting on social media about her asshole family (me) denying her from being able to see her tributes. Mind you, her tributes are on her damn computer or CapCut or whatever she used to make them.\n\nI stupidly texted her briefly and said I wish it could have worked out but she just reiterated I am a selfish asshole. Am I?",

      "scenario_description": "So backstory: I'm from the UK, but moved to the US when I married my spouse. We have kids and my parents are very keen to have a relationship with them. My parents are still \"together\" but don't get on, so they refuse to come at the same time as each other.\n\nSince I moved over here my parents have stayed here for around a month EACH every year. We do have the space in the house but I still am never comfortable when they're here. My parents are very high strung people and I did not have a pleasant upbringing, I was always on edge and I do not feel comfortable around them. They don't get on with each other and for example my dad (who is staying for a MONTH) expects to borrow a vehicle to be able to get around (we live in a very rural area). And was very irritated this morning because the car's battery died and I refused to let him take my car.\n\nEvery time I broach the subject of them not staying here any more they say things like \"you're going to bar me from seeing my grandkids?\" This is more of an issue with my mother than my father. As she's more vocal. Or the fact that it was me who decided to move 5000 miles away and therefore I need to accommodate their needs. They stated they can't afford an air BnB (no hotels in the area).\n\nI DO live in a very rural area with no real amenities apart from a few air BnBs. So their argument is that if they cannot stay with me then they are barred from all contact.\n\nWhen they're here they expect me to feed them, and cater to them. My dad is a type 1 diabetic and is very set in his ways so he is very picky. They expect it because they're my parents. I don't visit my home country very often and so have rarely stayed with them and would 100% get a hotel if it was the other way round.\n\nI am just exhausted. They say it's only a few months a year and they are there to \"help\" but taking my kids to the park 3 times a week and doing the dishwasher every day isn't the help I want or need. I just want to keep my routine and feel safe and comfortable within my own home.\n\nETA: I do have a fairly massive house with a lot of empty space (not fancy, but large as my husbands a builder) which is the main reason I think that my parents are so frustrated at my action. And why i am receiving backlash if I ask friends around me if I’m being unreasonable. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (25F) live with my boyfriend Liam (24M). About a month ago, his mom Tanya began claiming she’s dying of cancer, but no diagnosis has been confirmed. Every hospital visit ends with her being sent home. A nurse even told Liam she might be faking.\n\nIt started when she stayed “one night” at our one-bedroom apartment. That turned into a week of chaos. She refused AC and fans (said they hurt her skin) but blow-dried her hair daily. The apartment smelled awful, everything had to be dark and silent, and she constantly demanded help. She even stormed into our bedroom at 3am asking Liam for massages (we sleep naked so that was awkward). She criticized our Buddhist souvenirs, insisted we hang a cross (I did), and complained non-stop. \n\nShe suggested we move in with her, an hour from our jobs/school.\n\nI’m a full-time student with two jobs and a 4.0 GPA, and I was falling behind. Liam, who works full-time, switched to remote work (his boss hated this) to care for Tanya.\n\nHer health “updates” were always shifting: MRI, canceled surgery, then chemo postponed due to infection, then E. coli. Always a new reason. No clear diagnosis or paperwork.\n\nWhen her husband David (who funds her lifestyle) was away, she made us go to her house to get her jewelry because she thinks he’ll steal it when she dies (he’s an alcoholic according to her). We were supposed to take her to the ER right after, but we ended up staying 16 hours doing chores. I folded 420 clothing items, cleaned the whole house, and felt like her unpaid maid. Not a single please or thank you.\n\nShe was stalling to go to the ER, and when we finally got there at 5 am, she said she’d check herself in, and sent us home. Three hours later, she called again, sobbing for help. She had been rejected by the ER. I suspect she faked it.\n\nLiam and I have both been skipping meals, losing sleep, and falling behind at work to help her. He once said he’s waiting for her to pass away so we can move to Europe. He’s been forced to manage her divorce, lawyer meetings, and funeral prep. Meanwhile, David \\*who’s paying the hospital bills and had been kept in the dark about all this) sent Liam aggressive texts like “I call bullshit” and “Don’t show up at my house no more,” then later apologized.\n\nTanya called again begging for help. But this time, she wanted *me,* because David is jealous of Liam. I had clearly told Liam I needed that weekend to study for final exams. And going to that house alone seemed sketchy.\n\nNow, I’m planning a 2–3 week Europe trip to see my mom, whom I haven’t seen in over a year. Liam says he supports it but called it “a little selfish.” He’s asked, “If I were dying, would you quit your job to be with me?” and “If it were your mom, would you help her?” I felt pressured to say yes. But truth is, my family wouldn’t lie to me or use me like this.\n\nI love Liam and want to be there for him. But I don’t trust his mom, and this is starting to affect our relationship.\n\n**AITA for refusing to help Tanya and going home to Europe?**",

      "scenario_description": "Hi Reddit, I (20F, almost 21) recently graduated college (I was homeschooled and finished early), and I’ve been dating my boyfriend (20M) for about a year now. We’re really happy together, but my mom is upset because she feels left out of our relationship.\n\nSome context: my boyfriend and I have a very playful dynamic. We joke around a lot, call each other silly names, and roast each other—it’s affectionate to us, but it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. My mom hates it. She thinks it’s disrespectful and inappropriate, but she’s also not around us enough to really understand the tone. Most of our time is spent at his house, which is way more comfortable.\n\nThe truth is, I avoid bringing him around my house because… it’s a little embarrassing. I have three younger brothers who don’t respect my privacy and constantly insert themselves into my business. The bathroom door doesn’t lock, the whole house smells like dog, and my parents argue a lot. It’s not exactly the vibe I want when I’m trying to relax or spend quality time with someone I love.\n\nMy mom recently told me she feels like I’m “pulling away” and that I’ve been leaving her out. She said she waited patiently until after the semester ended to bring it up, but now she’s really upset. She’s especially mad that she hasnt met his parents yet, and that he doesn’t follow her on social media. But like… I’m almost 21. I feel like I’m allowed to move at my own pace and not treat my relationship like a family group project.\n\nOn top of that, she’s said some really mean things about my boyfriend (both to me and to him) just because she doesn’t like him. That makes me even less inclined to involve her in our relationship. I’m an adult now, and while I love her, I also feel like I have a right to make boundaries.\n\nSo, Reddit—AITA for not including my mom more in my relationship and keeping her at a bit of a distance?\n",

      "scenario_description": "I (20F) am a college student, and whenever I come home—especially for the summer—I feel like I become my family’s default chauffeur. Last year, I was constantly driving my younger siblings to school, picking them up, taking them to their friends’ houses, etc. Even if I was tired, working, or just wanted to sleep in like a normal person, I was expected to do it all without complaint. It even left me to the point where i decided to never come home because if I got a few weekdays off I’d be expected to drive kids around morning through night.\n\nThis year, I no longer have to drive my siblings because they’re older and have friends who can drive them—but now I’m the go-to driver for my grandmother. A few years ago, my dad agreed to let her live with us instead of going into a retirement home. She’s older now and clearly needs more care, but instead of hiring someone to help (which they could afford), a lot of those responsibilities have been silently handed over to me.\n\nThe day I came home from college—literally within minutes of pulling into the driveway after a 3-hour drive—I was told I had to take her 30 minutes away and stay out with her for about 5–6 hours. The next morning, I was expected to take her to a hair appointment at 8 AM. I hadn’t even unpacked yet. On top of that, she had already been making plans for me to take her to doctor’s appointments before I even got home—before I had a chance to say, “Hey, I need to check my schedule.”\n\nIt’s not that I’m mad at her. I’m honestly not. She’s sweet and I care about her, and I understand that she needs support. I just feel overwhelmed. It’s more frustrating that my parents haven’t considered hiring a part-time caregiver or reaching out to my extended family for help. My aunt is a stay-at-home mom with kids who are old enough to take care of themselves, and she’s unemployed. Her son—my cousin—is my age, didn’t go to college, dropped out of trade school, and works part-time. No one else helps. And my dad’s the one who agreed to take on this responsibility, but so much of the day-to-day driving and caretaking stuff that he doesn’t want to do gets passed down to me.\n\nTo be clear: I do get paid for Fridays (when I usually drive my grandma around for hours), but it’s around minimum wage, and I recently had to turn down a better nanny job because I’m so tied up helping her. And the thing is—it’s never just Fridays. I’ll get home from a long shift and barely walk in the door before I’m being asked to go pick her up or drop her off again. It’s constant, and it feels like I’m just expected to drop everything, no matter what I’m doing.\n\nI know I have free time after I’m off the clock. I’m not working 24/7. I’m not saying I shouldn’t help at all—I want to help. I just hate feeling like I’m expected to handle everything without question or support, while other people who could help just... don’t.\n\nSo, AITA for being bitter and frustrated about this whole situation? Any advice?",

I absolutely adore animals, but I’m sadly allergic to dog hair, and since beagles shed a lot, it would be pretty uncomfortable for me to have them in the apartment. The reason why they asked, is because they said they could only visit for about one and a half hour if they were to leave the dogs at home, and they can stay longer if they can bring them. My boyfriend told me this, and he’s kindly reminded them I’m allergic. He tried to come up with some solutions, such as if the dogs could stay in another room—which would be his gaming room where he has his computer and playstation, since I don’t really go in there that often. Or, if the dogs could be in the garden (which is a shared garden so we’ll have to ask our other neighbours if that would be okay). Another option would be if they could maybe get a dog sitter for a couple hours, since they often have some family member look after them when they’re out of the house. I thought asking them this wouldn’t be a problem, because they already knew of my allergies. When I visit their house, I always get very puffy-eyed and I sneeze a lot, and when the dogs sit next to me or on my lap, my skin gets irritated, which is super uncomfortable. I absolutely love their beagles, and that’s why when I visit them, I still sometimes still pet them despite my allergies. However, when I get home, I always shower and wash my hair to get rid of the allergy symptoms, which would probably be worse if they stayed in our apartment because the hairs would be everywhere. The reason why I think I might be the asshole, is because I was having a phone call with my own mom about this. She said it’s super rude that we asked them not to bring their dogs, and that it’s pretty bitchy of me. Maybe I’m in the wrong, but I don’t think I’m that bitchy for asking them not to bring their dogs? I wouldn’t bring my cat to someone else’s house if I knew they’re allergic. My mom argued I could just vacuum the house, which yes, I could do that after, but I thought maybe I could ask them about not bringing their dogs first. If they really, really need to bring their dogs along, I’ll allow it because I don’t want to upset anyone. They haven’t responded to my boyfriend’s texts yet, but he’s on my side. I’m just worried I’m not being a good host for having asked them not to bring their dogs along, because of what my mom said. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: I’m allergic to dogs but my boyfriend’s dad and stepmom want to bring their beagles along to our apartment, with the argument they can’t stay long if the dogs were to stay home. My mom said it’s very rude of me to ask them not to do that.",

      "scenario_description": "\nHi Reddit. I (20F) still live at home with my parents in Germany while I attend university nearby. I’m autistic and also have anxiety, which means routines and familiar environments are extremely important to me. My room is my safe space and I’ve set it up in a way that helps me stay calm lighting, furniture placement, everything.\n\nMy parents are generally supportive, but sometimes they do things that really throw me off. A few days ago, I came home from class and found that my mom had surprised me by reorganizing my entire room. She moved my desk under the window, changed where my books were and even swapped out my blanket for one she said “looked nicer.” She also lit a scented candle to “make it feel cozy.”\n\nIt immediately overwhelmed me. The smell was too strong, the lighting felt wrong and I couldn’t even find my noise-canceling headphones. I started crying and had to go sit in the bathroom for like 30 minutes just to calm down.\n\nWhen I told my mom I appreciated the gesture but needed things to stay how I put them, she got upset. She said she was “just trying to help” and that I was “overreacting.” My dad chimed in too and said I should be more “flexible” and that it’s “not healthy” to be so attached to how a room looks.\n\nI tried to explain it’s not about looks it’s sensory and mental. But they said I was being ungrateful and dramatic. I asked them not to touch my room without asking first, and now things are tense. My mom is hurt, and my dad says I owe her an apology.\n\nAITA for setting that boundary?\n",

      "scenario_description": "I’ll try not to bore everyone with small, insignificant details, but I also want to provide some context to my situation. \n\nI have been living with my dad (65M) for the past 5 or so years who, by the way, I didn’t even get to meet until I was 11 because my mom (55F) had me convinced he was a horrible person who abandoned her and didn’t want anything to do with me. Turns out, that obviously wasn’t true and he came looking for me when he found out I existed.\n\nMy mom has a long history of alcohol abuse and she ended up in rehab during my sophomore year of high school, which is how I ended up at my dad’s in the first place. My childhood was extremely chaotic, always bouncing from place to place. We were couch surfing a lot because we barely had any money due to my mom’s inability to hold down any job. \n\nShe was in and out of treatment facilities for about 4 years until she finally stayed sober for a whole year and is in a much better place now. Due to this, she insists that I “don’t need my dad anymore” and I should move back in with her. Even though things were obviously very awkward at first, I’ve developed an extremely healthy and positive relationship with my dad. He’s done his best to step up and be the best father figure he can to me despite the situation and is always supportive of me.\n\nMy mom, on the other hand, it feels like she’s only supportive of me when it benefits her, so I’ve made it clear that I would be happy to visit her, but I had no interest in moving back in with her. When I told her this, she got very upset and went on about what a terrible and selfish son I am. She told me that my dad was only brainwashing me and she was the one who raised me for 15 years while he “sat back and did nothing”. \n\nI know I’m obviously old enough to make my own decisions and, of course, I do plan to get my own place at some point. But the economy is tough right now so I’m very dependent on my dad supporting me right now. Yes, I do have a job, by the way, and I pay for my own, gas, phone bill, etc. \n\nAm I really the asshole here? I genuinely don’t understand why it’s so wrong of me not to want to go back to living with someone who I now realize made my childhood an actual living hell.\n\nEDIT: I was really expecting to get so much shit for this post because 1) it’s Reddit and 2) I still live with my dad at 19. But I gotta say, y’all have been so kind! I’ve been trying my best to upvote all the nice and supportive comments. Genuinely, thank you so much to everyone who has commented and given me such amazing advice! It truly means so much to me! :)\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "Hi Reddit. I’m a 19-year-old F college student, currently majoring in nursing. My dad 38 M is in prison for money laundering, and ever since he’s been incarcerated, he’s been asking me to do things that I’m just not comfortable with. Some of these things started before he even went in.\n\nFor example, he asked me to take care of one of my younger brothers (half-brother) who just turned 10 I say half- brother so you can understand we have different mothers I love him deeply, but the 10-year-old’s mom isn’t the most attentive parent. He often isn’t clean, has untreated eczema that’s so bad he scratches himself into sores, and generally looks unkept. It’s sad and upsetting to see, because I didn’t experience any of this as a child and I he doesn’t deserve that. My dad told me I should call her and “make sure she’s doing right by him.” I told him no, that it’s not my place. She’s a grown woman and that’s her child. Trying to call her and tell her what to do would likely come off as judgmental or cause tension, especially since she and my mom have had altercations in the past. I don’t want to get in the middle of that drama or risk making the situation worse.\n\nHe got mad that I wouldn’t call her, but that’s just one example. More recently, he’s been pressuring me to create a PayPal account using my name and credit so he can send money out. I’ve told him I’m not comfortable with that either, especially because he’s literally in prison for money laundering. I’m a student taking out loans, and I have to protect my credit and name. When I refused, he got upset and accused me of not helping the family.\n\nHe also expects me to drive home every weekend (I live about 2 hours away) to basically co-parent my little brother — take him out, be with him, spend the weekend like I’m his fun guardian. But I’m in college full time with a demanding major. It’s just not realistic for me to give up every weekend like that, mentally, physically, or financially.\n\nThere’s a pattern: when I say “no,” he either guilt-trips me or acts like I’m letting the whole family down. It’s taking a toll on me, and I’m starting to feel like I’m being used more than I’m being supported.\n\nSo… AITA for setting these boundaries and refusing to do what he asks?\n\n",
