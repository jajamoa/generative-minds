      "post_title": "AITA for not inviting my neighbor's kids to my daughter's birthday party?",
      "scenario_description": "I (25F) held a birthday party for my 7 year old daughter in our backyard this past Friday afternoon/evening. It wasn't a very big thing at all, just her and a handful of her school friends + some parents. I did rent a bouncy castle but other than that they mostly just played on our swingset, played lawn games, and had dinner/cake. No organized activities or anything, very casual yet fun. I think all the guests had a good time and my daughter definitely did.\n\nThen at around 10PM (hours since everyone went home), my next door neighbor (~30F) texted me that the kids had been way too loud all evening. I texted back apologizing and saying that I hoped it hadn't bothered her too much. She responded by saying she was more bothered by the fact that her kids weren't invited and had to sit by the window watching everyone else have fun on the bouncy castle. I'm taken back because I hardly know this woman. Her two kids are probably about 3 and 4 and I think my daughter's only met them once. I try to be polite and apologize for overlooking them. \n\nThen yesterday I was scrolling though Facebook and I see a post from this woman being super vague talking about how we all need to look out for each other's children and about how it takes a village with no context. I go to her page and she's been posting stuff like that all morning. Now maybe I should have ignored it but unfortunately I made the decision not to. I texted her again asking if the posts she'd been making were about me and if there was anything I could do to make this up to her. She ignored me.\n\nAnd now today (*mother's* day of all days) she's posting this heinous stuff about how teen moms are unfit parents and shouldn't get to keep their kids, among other things. I was a teen mom and she knows this and I don't think it's presumptuous for me to think she's talking about me.\n\nObviously it's not OK for her to be posting what she's posting, but still, did I mess up by not bothering to invite her kids? I've been thinking about how it would feel for me as a mother for my daughter to not be invited to the next door neighbor's kid's party. It would probably be upsetting to see her left out. Still, my neighbors kids are so much younger than my daughter and I don't think they would have enjoyed playing with bigger kids. My daughter also shouldn't have to share her party with strangers, in my opinion (but maybe I'm wrong on that?).\n\nSo AITA for not inviting the neighbor's kids? I'm starting to feel bad about it.",

      "scenario_description": "Husband and I bought a new to us RV last September. Due to a hard winter we’ve only been out in it a couple times so far, so we are sitting on a lot of pent-up excitement. I managed to reserve a primo campsite at one of our favorite lakes this coming weekend. A couple days ago SIL (who lives 3 hours away) invited us to a bbq along with some other family. We politely declined as we have plans. All was good until I get a text from SIL stating if it’s just the 2 of us going, we should reschedule our trip. Trying to be diplomatic, I offered that we could visit them the following weekend (holiday) and stressed that we were in no way asking them to change their scheduled bbq.  In the meantime other SIL texts saying I hate to be morbid but you never know how long we are all going to be around.\n\nMy husband requested time off work for this trip, and state park reservations are really hard to get on the weekends, not to mention losing half our reservation fee. It’s not like we never see these family members. Are we being unreasonable for not cancelling?",

      "scenario_description": "My husband (35M) and I (35F) recently built a new house.\n\nMy FIL is a professional contractor and he was the contractor for our house build. My BIL (husband's brother) is a carpenter and he also worked on our house full time during the build. So it was definitely a family project. My FIL and BIL are both really nice people and I'm grateful for both of them.\n\nHowever, my SIL (34F, husband's sister), is a miserable and rude person. There are times she has been so rude to me that family has had to step in and tell her to stop. A lot of her rude comments have been related to the fact that my husband and I don't have any kids yet (we plan to start trying for a baby next year). SIL feels strongly that women should have kids when they are in their 20's. She has told me that I'm going to have miscarriages, my kids are going to be autistic/have down syndrome, I'm going to be an old mom etc because my husband and I decided to wait until our 30's to have kids.\n\nIn the past when we have had SIL over to our house, she only makes rude comments and never has anything nice to say. When we hosted a birthday party for my husband (in our old house), SIL walked in the door, looked around, and said \"wow, your house is actually clean or once\". SIL stopped by our new house when it was under construction and her only comment was \"I can't believe how small your new house looks\".\n\nSIL doesn't live close by (thankfully). She will be visiting my MIL and FIL this summer. It's the first time she has visited since our house build was completed.\n\nMy FIL and BIL are proud of the house and want to show it off. And I want them to be able to show it off. I'm really grateful for the work they put into the house. There are a bunch of other family members that will be visiting this summer and I'm happy to take all of them through the house.\n\nBut, given our history, I'd rather not have SIL through the house. My in-laws know SIL and I aren't on good terms. I'm sure SIL will want to see the house, but I doubt she will ask my husband or I directly if she can come by. She will most likely get MIL to ask my husband or I if they can stop by.\n\nWIBTA if I told her that she can't view our new house?",

She got engaged a few months ago and at the beginning of last month she called me and told me that they’re going to have the wedding in Alberta since his whole family is there, then she said that she wants me there but would “totally understand” if I didn’t come since I don’t fly and it’s a 3-4 day drive, at that moment I didn’t realize she was telling me not to come so I told that I wouldn’t miss it for the world, that I would drive with our cousin and make a road trip out of it. \n\nLast Thursday I got my invitation and when I called to RSVP I asked about the dress code, since my dad told me that she emailed him about a certain color suit and tie so they could coordinate the pictures. She told me that I didn’t have to worry about that, that it’s *nothing personal* but because I have stretched ears, piercings and a tattoo on my hand, I don’t fit the aesthetic they’re going for, so *if I come* we’ll take pictures with just us but I won’t be in THE pictures. I don’t cry often but that made me cry and I told her that if she doesn’t want me there I won’t go, she didn’t say anything and we hung up.\n\nOn Friday I had lunch with my grandparents and my uncle and told them about it, my grandmother got so upset that she started crying and told me that if I’m not welcome neither are my grandparents. My aunt and her husband and all my cousins RSVP’d no as well and my brother and parents are thinking about not going as well. Although it means the world that they love me so much I feel awful, like I’ve ruined my sister’s wedding, that I should’ve kept my mouth shut.\n\nTell me, am I the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "I (21F) let my mom borrow $8000 at the start of the year. For context, I didn’t have a good relationship with my mom after I left home when I was 19. We exchanged a lot of words and I cut her off. Last year I got my Cows and Plows, which is a large sum of money for Indigenous Peoples. Shortly after my mom reached out after months and asked for $8000. She claimed she was on the verge of losing the house and she (and her boyfriend) were behind bills. Mind you, they couldn’t afford the house after nearly all the kids grew up and moved out. I caved in and gave her the money, signing legal IOU papers to make sure she paid me back. I felt bad because my little brother is still living with her. She was supposed to start paying me back in March. Nothing. In April, only $300 when the minimum agreement was $500. May and June, nothing at all. She told me to not tell anyone and no one knew of their financial struggle. But here I find out that she was borrowing money from nearly everyone she could—my siblings, aunts, uncles, and I think my grandma as well. I gave her the largest amount. I also learned that her boyfriend, who was seemingly always out of the job did have a job… rating movies online in exchange for bitcoin. He was borrowing money to keep unlocking the next level in this bitcoin website. \n\nAnd now, I was considering taking her to small claims court and my sister, although she means well, told my mom that even tho I didn’t want her to. My mom texted me just today and started saying a bunch of awful things to me. Telling me I’m a disgrace and that I will never amount to anything, so on and so forth. And I also learned that they stole money from my older brother while he was in the hospital. She threatened to charge me with harassment even tho she was the one that reached out to say all these things to me. Small claims court was the last resort, but would it have been too much? AITA for wanting my money back? ",

      "scenario_description": "I'm a female in my mid-20s. I got engaged recently, and now it's time to plan my wedding. My mother (late 50s) has been looking forward to my wedding since I started dating my fiancé a few years back. She got married in the 90s and didn't get to plan her own wedding due to her controlling mother. I'm sure that was somewhat commonplace at the time. Knowing how horrible her mother truly was, I understand her frustrations.\n\nBecause she didn't get to plan her own wedding, I think she's channeling her desire for it through me. This is her chance to plan a wedding. Except it's my wedding. I'm the one who should be doing the planning.\n\nA few days ago she told me about how another couple she knows repurposed a wedding dress. I said that I didn't want to do that, I'd rather just go buy one or thrift one. She then kept saying how we can make hers look so much better, we can change this, that, and so forth. I firmly said no, and that when I say no, please stop pushing the idea.\n\nIt happened again tonight. Her friend's daughter got married at a particular venue. She asked me to send them an email about pricing and what not, so I did. Never heard back. There's barely any info about weddings on the center's website. It's also a little far. I told Mom that I wasn't really interested. \"But it's all indoors!\" she said. I told her again that I wasn't interested. Then I said something that pissed her off.\n\n\"We've had this conversation before. When I say no to something, quit pushing it.\" Mom did not respond. I left the room. I was always the nicer (aka I hid my feelings more) of her two children, so I'm sure she was complaining to Dad about how mean I was being.\n\nI know that her behavior is stemming from not getting to plan her own wedding. But it's not my job as her daughter to make up for what she didn't get in her life. She's always treated her children this way. I'm open to suggestions, but if I say no, I wish she would shut up about it. She also tends to just do what other people do instead of doing her own research.\n\nI'm in my mid-twenties. I spent a quarter of a century pleasing her and revolving every choice around her. It's time I please myself and my future-husband.\n\nTLDR: AITA for telling my mother to stop pushing wedding ideas so much? And for wanting to plan my own wedding without her approval?",

      "scenario_description": "I (24F) have been living with my roommate, Sarah (26F), for about a year. We generally get along, but lately, there’s been tension over her borrowing habits, and I need some perspective on whether I overreacted. Now here’s an interesting problem, I own a car, and Sarah doesn’t. I’m happy to help out occasionally, like driving her to the grocery store or giving her a lift to work if her ride falls through. I’ve always made it clear, though, that I need advance notice and that my car isn’t a free for all. It’s not just about gas or wear and tear, it’s my only way to get to my job (I’m a nurse with odd shifts), and I can’t risk it being unavailable or damaged.\nAbout three months ago, Sarah started asking to borrow my car more frequently which sometimes for small things like grabbing takeout or visiting friends. I let her borrow it a couple of times after she promised to be careful, but I noticed she wasn’t great about refilling the gas or cleaning up like leaving coffee cups or muddy footprints. I gently reminded her to respect my car, and she apologized, so I let it slide. Last month, things escalated. Sarah asked to borrow my car for a quick errand as usual but kept it for six hours without texting me. I had to cancel plans because I couldn’t get to them, and when she returned, the gas tank was nearly empty. I was frustrated and told her I wasn’t comfortable lending it out anymore unless it was an emergency. She got defensive, saying I was being petty and that roommates should share resources. I explained that my car isn’t a shared resource and this is my personal property, and I need it for work. She rolled her eyes but seemed to drop it. Last week, Sarah asked to borrow my car again to visit her sister, who lives an hour away. I said no, citing the previous issues and my upcoming 12 hour shift. She got upset, saying her sister was having a rough time and she really needed to see her. I felt bad, so I offered to drive her there myself on my day off, but she said that wasn’t convenient for her schedule. She then accused me of being selfish and said I was holding my car over her head to control her. I stood my ground and said I wasn’t comfortable lending it out after she disregarded my boundaries before.\nSince then, Sarah’s been cold, barely speaking to me, and she told a mutual friend I’m being unreasonable and unsupportive. Our friend thinks I should’ve just let her borrow the car since her sister’s situation sounds serious, but I feel like Sarah’s not respecting my needs or my property. I get that she’s stressed, and I don’t want to seem heartless, but I also don’t think I’m obligated to let her use my car, especially after she’s been careless.\n\nAITA for refusing to lend her my car? I want to be a good roommate, but I feel like my boundaries are being ignored.",

I told her that it’s difficult for me because of how late I get home and the problems it causes at home. I also mentioned that I’m usually exhausted after work and that going there daily would be too much.\n\nShe said it was fine, but then got really upset and started yelling at me. She brought up personal things, saying I can’t keep a job and making me feel like I’m unreliable. I was just trying to explain my situation, but she seemed to take it as an attack.\n\nNow I don’t feel comfortable going to her house anymore, even though I care about her and the baby.

Of course, it’s a privilege to photograph these special moments for my sister and future brother-in-law. However, she’s now asked me to be the photographer at the upcoming wedding. Once again, it’s an honour to be asked, but I declined and said I’d rather attend as a guest and actually enjoy the day instead of viewing it all through a camera.\n\nShe didn’t take that too well and has caused a massive drama over it. I’ve had family and friends texting me asking why I won’t do it, and my parents insisting I should because it’s not about me. I felt it was a perfectly reasonable decision to decline, but after so many people disagreeing with me, I’m not so sure anymore\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "There is so much back story here and since I am a behavior analyst, there are so many facets I see as contributing factors to every situation. With that caveat I will try to keep things concise while giving all the info needed to weigh things out. Let’s use bullet points for the back story.\n\n1. Husband and I are happily married for 14 years (we have been working super hard on our marriage particularly the last 3 years).\n2. A lot of the strife of our marriage comes from the worst in him being conditioned by my in-laws (anger from the DIL, overly critical from MIL)\n3. One of the things that bothers me the most about the lot is their lack of respect for other peoples time - I could name a thousand examples, but picture 10:00pm dinners and 11:00 breakfasts while my kids starve (and I am called rude if I feed them early, which at some point I stopped caring and just feed the kids) \n4. Things have been as good as can be with them for several years now. We’ve set up some boundaries that have been helpful. \n5. Lately there have been a string of things that have left me hurt and that family just doesn’t talk about things. My husband’s solution is to just double down on boundaries- a clear defensive mechanism produced by his own hurt. \n6. I’ve done a lot for them, being as helpful as possible, putting up with a ton of their stuff with grace and forgiveness. \n\nToday- we are supposed to join them for camping for the 4th. This is the activity that has become the hardest for me to do and we haven’t gone for a long while. Husband and I agreed to go and since then a couple more hurtful things have happened. \n\nI am struggling. I don’t want to ruin everyone else’s time and normally I can push the selfish aside and just put on a convincing smile and get through it. All day today while packing I have been an ass to my husband and I can’t seem to shake it. \n\nI just proposed the idea of just me staying home and he readily supported the idea. \n\nI feel like a jerk, but maybe not totally the a$$hole. AITA for not being able to do the thing this time? Or am I taking one for the team by missing out but ensuring that I don’t ruin everyone else’s time? ",

      "post_title": "AITA for Asking My Parents to Pay Me Back?",
      "scenario_description": "I (19F) was asked by my parents two years ago to give them a total of $4000. The reason they had asked me was because my mother had recently lost her job at the same time that we had just moved to a pricier house, so it was really bad timing. Just to preface, I was not the only one they asked to borrow money from, they asked for help from my older brothers (22M and 31M) as well. However, because my 22 year old brother didn’t have a job and my 31 year old brother was already moved out and paying his own bills they only borrowed a $1000 from each of them. \n\nWhen they asked me for money I didn’t hesitate at all to say yes because my parents have been really supportive and caring of me and my siblings, and so I wanted to do my best to help them during these tough times. Fast forward to nearly two years later, my mother has found a new job and our financial situation is much more stable. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes: My parents promised they would pay me back as soon as my mother found another job. And they did, they immediately paid $1000 to me and my siblings. So they fully paid off my brothers, while still owing me $3000. In any other situation this would be fine with me, because I understand that they still have expenses and debts to pay. I’m not currently using that money as I am still living with them and am taking out loans for my studies. However, while they still do owe me money, they’ve also started to add a bunch of features and upgrades to the new house. They’ve done things like put grass in our yard, built a patio and shed in the backyard, among other things. And I know for a fact that the cost of these things far surpasses the money they owe me. \n\nBecause of this, I have started to feel anxious because I still haven’t gotten my money back. The money they borrowed was about half of my total money from my first ever part-time job. And now that I am older I have plans to move out and I want to invest that money they owe me.\n\nOne day they told me they had plans to expand our drive way. This was kinda my breaking point and it lead me to bring up the money they owe me, because this was yet another upgrade they didn’t need and would cost a fortune. But when I asked, my parents suddenly got very defensive, and they said that I shouldn’t be acting selfish like this and allowing money to get in the way of family. They also said that because of them, I don’t have to pay rent while I’m studying and working, so this was the least I can do. \n\nI love my parents and they insisted that they’ll pay me back when they can, but I can’t help but feel weird when I see them spending all this money and still not keeping or acknowledging their promise of paying me back sooner. But I’m also starting to have doubts after my conversation with them because it did make me feel like I’m a selfish person who only cares about money. AITA?",

How, I know that parents sometimes like to post about their kids. But she's posting my face and telling/showing the internet stuff I told/showed her in confidence. For example, artwork that I didn't want to show to strangers in the internet or stuff like stories that I didn't want to be shared.\n\nWell, I finally confronted her about it after I showed her a drawing I made only to see it posted about 30 minutes later. But then she got all annoyed and said something along the lines of \"well then what's the point of taking pictures?\" And now I just feel really guilty but I can't help but feel like I have a point.\n\nSo what do you think?
