      "scenario_description": "I have a really old car but am saving it for my brother because he just got his license and cars are expensive to get right now. I drive a lot for work and am in a college that is pretty far away so I travel a lot during the semester. My car has been having issues when I travel far (the alternator went out once on the highway), so I’ve been scared to drive it far. My sister has two cars, one she got when she needed a car, and the other because she wanted it.\n\nWe agreed that I could use one of her cars. I don’t make much money, so she said I only need to pay half of the insurance, and I’d be responsible if I broke anything.\n\nBefore I started driving the car, my dad said the back tires needed to be changed. They never got replaced, but the car has been fine. I’ve had it for maybe three or four months, and now my sister is moving out and will take the car with her.\n\nNow that she's moving out and the semester is finally over (I also had to do a summer course), my sister is saying that I have to change the tires, I've become to annoyed with it so I was like \"whatever\" and I'll change the two back tires just to get them to stop bothering me. But she started yelling at me that I have to do all four because I had the vehicle and it the \"principle\" of it that I change all four because I used the car for four months and she is the one that gave my car an oil change when she used it ( I have literally told her I can pay back for the oil change because it is far less expensive). So we got into a heated argument and she's like cursing at me and everything that apparently I never said thank you, well one I think I did but I'm not super like \"nice\" about it, like I believe I said something around the lines like \"alright cool thanks\". But she got these tires three years ago, pretty much all this \"damage\" is from her cause my four months does not equal to her 2 years and 6 months usage. I personally believe I shouldn't even pay for the two. But we kinda agreed with me paying for two, her paying for the other two, but I go to get all four changed. But now she's saying because I won't pay for all four I owe her the other half of the insurance that I haven't paid. And I told her no, I will not be doing that, so she said I can't use her car anymore, and I laughed in her face and was like \"okay mister tough guy\", which ngl was immature but she got me so frustrated. Anyways, I took my car back, and I was gonna see if I can take it in next week to get it changed.\n\nI told my boyfriend, and he’s really upset because he feels my family always takes advantage of me. He thinks I should text her and tell her I won’t pay for all the tires or the insurance. He says I shouldn’t be responsible for the tires when they were already bad when I started using the car. He also says I never agreed to pay for all four tires or the extra insurance, and the car will be gone soon anyway.\n\nWhat do you think I should do?",

I was hoping he would just give us the money like he always said so we could use it how we want. I get that maybe it feels different for him if he is not directly paying for stuff, but it kind of feels like we only get the full amount if we do things his way…. !? \n\nAm I being a spoiled brat for not wanting to follow the exact same plan my sister did?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi, I’ve never done one of these before, but I’ve seen them on TikTok, so forgive me if it’s bad 🙏\n\nIn my country, you pay an extra 15 cent deposit on recyclable items (like bottles or cans), but you can get it back by returning them to a machine in a store. Since this started, I’ve been returning bags of bottles and cans weekly. I don’t mind, as I usually get to keep the money as pocket money. But for the past few weeks, I haven’t been returning them, so today I had five bags to bring in instead of my usual two. That meant more money. I ended up with €23, which is more than usual.\n\nNormally, I’d take the receipt to my dad and he’d give me the cash, but today I saw an option on the machine to donate the €23 to an autism charity. I decided to donate it, thinking neither me nor my family needed it and it could go to someone who does. I didn’t ask my dad first (probably should’ve) because I assumed we’d agree. When I told him, he got mad. At first, he thought I was joking, but when he realized I wasn’t, he called me selfish, saying I was too spoiled to understand what I’d done. He ranted about how the “CEO of autism” (I have no idea who that is) probably makes over €100k a year, and my money likely went straight to him.\n\nI tried to explain my reasoning, hoping he’d understand, but that made him even angrier. He then said he’d take €23 from my savings and donate it to teach me a lesson. I didn’t really care, so went upstairs, got the €23 from my savings, and gave it to him, thinking he’d let it go. But then he said he didn’t actually want the money and just wanted to see how I’d react. I didn’t know what to say to that, so I stayed quiet.\n\nHe kept yelling at me, saying I’m only nice when it suits me, and asked why I didn’t donate all my birthday money to charity. To be honest, I’m saving it for a friend’s gift soon. Maybe that’s selfish, but I don’t know. I kind of snapped and told him to listen to himself and said he was being selfish for getting mad at me for donating to charity. That only made him rant more, saying he donates to a different charity every week, and it’s his money. He said I donated money that wasn’t mine. I don’t think that’s fair because he would’ve given it to me it anyway? I told him I’d rather the money go to a good cause than spend it on something pointless, but then he ended the conversation and said he didn’t want to talk to me anymore. Now he’s ignoring me.\n\nI know this is a stupid argument, but it’s not the first time something like this has happened. When I was around eight, I had a similar issue cause I gave money to a charity for guide dogs. I’m starting to believe I really am just selfish. My family and I argue a lot, about things like this and I just want an unbiased opinion on whether I’m in the wrong.\n\nSorry if this is hard to read. I’m struggling with the 3000 character limit and I’m just typing out everything I remember. Thanks to anyone who actually read this.",

      "scenario_description": "I (20F) live in a flat with 3 other girls. We recently moved in, and everything was fine until I mentioned that I’m planning to start tutoring kids (from our building) at home.\n\nMy dad is going through financial problems and can’t send me money right now, so I really need to earn and support myself. I don’t want to be a burden on him. I haven’t started tutoring yet, but I plan to teach around **8–10 kids** between **5 PM and 7 PM**, either in the **hall or my room**, whichever works best. This is a very normal tuition time in India.\n\nThe issue is, one of my flatmates is against it. She says **5–7 PM is her study time**, and she’ll be disturbed by the noise. She also said she needs to **sleep by 10 PM**. However, we all have **college from 8 AM to 4 PM**, so realistically, most of our free time starts after that—and from what I’ve observed, she doesn’t go to sleep at 10 PM anyway.\n\nI even offered to:\n\n* Let her study wherever she feels comfortable during that time\n* Keep the kids in one area with the door closed\n* Manage the noise as much as possible (though the flat isn’t soundproof)\n\nDespite trying to compromise, she’s completely against the idea.\n\nI understand shared living requires consideration, and I’m trying to be respectful. But I also really need this income and don’t think my request is unreasonable.\n\nWe have 2 rooms and one hall with open kitchen connecting to hall. \n\nSo Reddit—**AITA for wanting to tutor kids at home in the evening even if it might slightly disturb one flatmate?** \n\nA lot of you shared your suggestions and advices. I'm really grateful to you all. \n\nAs of now I'm considering to change in timings for tutoring and making it only one hour **6:30pm-7:30pm**. So that she can study peacefully and don't get disturbed. \n\nWith 5-6 kids at most. \n\nKeeping the environment as quite as possible.\n\n(Also I have noticed while talking to her that she has no problem with the kids if I share my students with her to teach, but I'm really not in favor of it considering I reached out to everyone for tutoring despite being new here and there is a chance I don't get as much kids as expected.) \n\nOn a side note-\n\nThere are no libraries within a radius of 5km.\n\nI can't afford a space as of now. \n\nThere is no common space available in building.\n\nI need to make money to pay my rent aswell. \n\n\n \n\n\n",

My screwdriver set is still missing, she kept my ladder for weeks until I asked for it back, and she used my Wi-Fi for a month without offering to chip in for the bill. Each time, I’ve been polite and let it slide, thinking she’d get better about it. Last weekend, I ran into Kyah at the grocery store. She was at the checkout with a cart full of stuff but realized she’d forgotten her wallet. She asked if I could cover her $85 bill, promising to pay me back that evening. I hesitated because of her track record with my stuff and because I’m on a tight budget myself. I told her I could spot her $20 for essentials but couldn’t cover the whole bill, especially since it included things like expensive snacks and beer. She got frustrated, saying I was unneighborly and that she’d have done the same for me. She ended up leaving most of her items behind and only buying what she could with the cash she found in her pocket. Since then, Kyah’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and another neighbor said Kyah called me stingy. I feel bad because I know forgetting a wallet is stressful, and maybe I could’ve helped more since we’re neighbors. But I also feel like her pattern of borrowing without reciprocating made me wary. \n\nAITA for not covering her full grocery bill?",

      "scenario_description": "Hey there! This is my first post on this reddit.......topic. Going to say that this happened last Tuesday and I'm still pretty upset about it. This isn't that long so I'll make this as long as I possibly can.\n\nFor private reasons we're going to name my sister Susie. My mom told me that she was going to a business conference in DC, so I was going to stay at my grandma's house for the week. Reminder, I have no car or a license. Something happened and I don't know what, but I was given one extra day from the day I was supposed to be there, I was meant to be dropped off on Monday but went there on Tuesday instead. My sister offered to take me to my grandma's house herself (according to my mom). Now to the story part.\n\nThe day comes around and I'm getting ready to leave with her, get my suitcase downstairs, my blowup mattress, the sheets and comforters for the mattress, my hygiene stuff, the stuff I bring for entertainment, the food I got, etc. My sister was putting so much pressure on me to get me ready as fast as possible, because she had to go home for work (not where me and my mom live). Keep telling me she was going to leave with or without me, told me to hurry up despite her apartment is a couple hours away from here, and kept telling me that she was going to leave in 35 minutes, 10 minutes, 7 minutes, like no time whatsoever. We forgot this Army monument thing that we were supposed to take to my grandma's house to pay tribute to my grandfather who died 2 years back, but I nearly forgot the food, I had to rush to get everything in there. Thankfully that was my last trip in there, but when I walked out of the house my sister's car was gone. I got so upset I immediately started to call her, but then I looked around a bit and just saw she parked in the parking lot across the street (my house is on a hill). I know you have to go back home but, come on Susie! That was not a cool thing to do. Then when we started to go to my grandma's house, she told me \"It's very rude to take that long\". Oh, I forgot to mention that most of my stuff was already in her car.\n\nFast forward to Sunday and my mom was picking me up from my grandmother's house. I told her everything on what happened with my sister. She was not that thrilled about it and told me that she was just going to take me there next time. I also found out about my sister offering to take me from my mom. I was really pissed on how she handled this, but I also feel a bit bad about the situation. If I'm the one to blame for this, please let me know. So, AITA for wasting my sister's time?",

The problem is while I was there I was given no help almost at all and expected to get up every hour to walk laps around the main area of the house twice. Not including getting up to go to the bathroom or getting myself food. I also wasn't allowed to stay in the guest bedroom past 9am I had to be on the couch. So while I was there my MIL was caring for my niece in the other room who is a year and a half but just left me to my own devices on caring for myself. Which I got jumped on by both the cat and their little dog who is about ten pounds. So by day two I just said I wanted to go home. Over the next few days I was getting better but day five I leaned down to pick up some of my husband's clothes cause I almost tripped over them. Causing me to later find my stitches having dried blood around them which is in my belly button so it wasn't hard to tell. They still have been bleeding but I'm not catching when but it really hurts to move too much and so I spent today laying down. Most days I get up amd pace cause it's my routine. The problem was today I was supposed to go to church but I didn't cause I wasn't able to sleep and the stitches kept hurting extremely bad. Later in the day after my husband got home my MIL texted this:\n\nMIL: Hey how are you doing?\n\nME:Still hurting but mostly just extremely tired. One of my stitches had dried blood so I didn't wanna accidentally open them or anything\n\nMIL:At this point, it shouldn't matter. Your insides should be practically healed. I've had similar procedures in the past and was up and doing everything that I needed to be doing within a day or two. It shouldn't be taking you this long to heal. Is it red, extremely hot around it or does it have puss coming out of it? \n\nME:No pus just and not hot just slightly bleeding for some reason\n\nMIL:It does not help to just lay around. You have to get up and get moving. I know you can do this. You are stronger than you know. When you feel weak, ask God to give you the strength and energy that you need in order to be the person that He created you to be. \n\nEND \n\nSo after my husband said that she was just worried that I'm not healing and that she is right and I need to get up and move but now I'm upset about it and have to go to work tomorrow as my first day back. I work at a gym but am not allowed by my doctor to pick up anything heavier than a jug of milk. I won't get my stitches out till a week from Tuesday so I need to be careful not to rip them. \n\nSo am I the asshole for getting upset and just not going cause I was hurting or is she right?\n\nUPDATE: So I returned to work today and had to go home after 3 hours as it felt like something was really hurting, and when I took the bandage off, there was more fresh dried blood. I called my surgeon's doctor's office, and they are scheduling a soon as possible complications follow up. As for my husband, he is 27, and before we married , he lived away from his parents to go to college. He and I have been married two years in August. To him, cleaning is a hassle he doesn't usually do since all of his off days he is usually doing yard work for his grandparents or parents. He works 9 hour shifts at a car dealership selling parts, but his drive got longer due to us moving, so it's an hour there and an hour back. I usually try to keep up with cleaning but have severe depression issues and drops that last for months at a time, so it gets dirty often. As for the reason for the surgery and why they did it is because I was having extreme abdominal pain on an almost daily basis and which was making me miserable and having difficulty finding a job and then working. My mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and great great aunt all had endo, and my mom had ovarian and endo cancer that spread up to her diaphragm. I also had been put on birth control that I didn't want as I really want kids and in my family die to complications you usually can't after 25 or it is incredibly difficult to the point of my cousin almost died giving birth to her son three months ago and she is 30. The reason for the birth control, as you can guess MIL. As my SIL just had my neice and they said not to have a baby till she was at least three. Which mostly translates to I need to be healthy beforehand, which I get. When I got married, I was 110 at 5'5 and had undiagnosed pcos, which I was having bi monthly cyst ruptures. They convinced me to take the birth control to help with the cyst. Which led to me getting ocular migraines and worst ruptures. I stopped the birth control almost four months ago and still no period even when they gave me the progesterone pills to try making me have one before surgery, which I just spotted for a day. I am now 127 pounds and am trying to get to at least 140 and hold it for at least four months, then start trying. My husband, yes, is a mama's boy but has gotten me out of my own shitty family, and we are trying to work on boundaries with his parents, but he is a little thick headed.\nDOCTOR UPDATE: saw a doctor who said I was fine as no fever or pus. Didn't check the internal stitches and my blood pressure was 100/50. At the moment I'm extremely tired and my mother is working hard to get a doctor who will check the internal stitches. I have stopped telling my MIL anything and my husband is worried but trying to get MIL involved ",

      "scenario_description": "So me (26M) and my girlfriend (25F) were making her cake for her birthday party tomorrow and I said that's too much sugar its disgusting I cant eat that (I was even disgusted to touch it). She almost cried telling me that's not nice her sister was in front and said the same too.\n\nFor context she nows I workout and I dont eat sugar and avoid procesed foods and carbs apart from sometimes fruit and honey in general while she eats everything.\n\nI had told her I would eat a small slice for her but after seeing the amount of sugar she put I rather eat my sole shoe than that and its not about the calories but the whole idea of putting that food in my mouth disgusts me. I guess she should have made a cake I could eat with fruit honey and almond floor for example.\n\n-edit: so I wanted to make update.\nIm never critical of my girlfriend eating \"unhealthy\" even i usually get her a desert she has one almost every day. I will occasionally when I feel she needs it try to encourage her to eat healthier but not with a negative attitude like it happened here. And I apologize and thanks for pointing it out and I hope you do better than me in similar circumstances. I will definitely won't repeat this again.\n\nAbout the comments telling me I have orthorexia I think you are right although it doesnt sound bad to me I'm just different? Recently I made some changes to my diet I primarily eat raw animal organs like brain liver heart eyes etc. Now even cooked meat somehow disgusts me and upsets and bloats my stomach when I eat it it even tastes tasteless. So I can say very few foods I feel nice when I eat them and raw organs are one of those.",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (M13) and I (H16) have been with my father (H40) for almost our entire lives. He was always an incredible person, the kind who would be called a \"perfect father\" if we were in a movie. He always did everything we wanted, was always kind, open-minded, a companion... a truly incredible father. But, like any incredible person, he always had his dark side. Whenever things got out of his control, he always went crazy. He would get angry to the point of yelling at my grandmother simply because he had a company attached to her apartment and she came to question him about the higher IPVA (vehicle tax) charges.\n\nMy mother (M36) was always the target of criticism about my father. The kind that truly humiliated her children. I grew up with the idea that my mother was a slut, something that eventually proved completely wrong. Long story short, we (sister, father, and I) moved to Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. My sister and I eventually discovered that this move was actually an escape from the things my father had done. He was the building manager of the building that died with my grandmother and stole money not only from the building but also from his own mother.\n\nShocked and devastated by this story, I ended up calling my mother to pick us up, which she did.\n\nI need to give some context about my sister. She was always extremely close to my father, a practically unbreakable one. With this whole story and some other disagreements, I ended up distancing myself from my father, something that didn't happen with my sister.\n\nToday, almost a year after this story and living with my mother, my father is constantly talking to my sister. She has always hated my mother (because of the things my father said) and always asked my father to come and get her too. We accessed her phone and discovered that she constantly speaks badly of me and my mother to him. Cursing and recounting everything we did through a distorted lens, as if it were what it really was.\n\nSince we returned to my mother's house, my sister has been isolated. Locked in her room, but always obeying everything my father says.\n\nMy mother and I discussed seeing a psychologist. But we backed down. Our main argument for this was \"no matter what the psychologist says, she will always follow her father,\" something that could be dangerous for her, especially since she knew who her real father was. We wanted her to understand, but a psychologist wouldn't be effective.\n\nOne day, I was traveling with my uncle and ended up telling him about this whole story. He called us idiots for it, for not getting her help. But why would we help someone who hates us? Who curses us?\n\nSo are we being idiots or not?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi everyone, this argument I had with my sister was 2 months ago, but it has been bothering me ever since because I don't know if I'm the asshole or justified for refusing my sister. In this situation, I was painted as the bad guy with several fingers pointing at me, and I feel very conflicted.\n\nMy sister and I live at home with our mother. We are both in our 20s (her 23F, me 27F) and have our own personal vehicles. My sister inherited my old Nissan after my dad helped me take out a loan to purchase my own car several years ago. The title is in my name, and I've been paying off the loan ever since. The particular reason that caused our argument was that one of her headlamps was out. Lately, she has been on a little self-discovery, which means she likes to go out and party late at night, but her car is a liability and is asking to be pulled over for her dead lamp. On the night of the disagreement, she got ready to go out and asked me around 10:30pm if she could borrow my car for the evening, since her lamp was out. It has been out for weeks, yet she never got it fixed.\n\nOn a side note, I had gotten one of my wisdom teeth pulled earlier and was feeling generally pretty anxious and bad because of severe swelling in my throat. I told my sister no to the request. I said she was not insured with my vehicle, and I wasn't comfortable with her driving it around at night near a bar. At this time, my plates were also up to be changed. I also knew she would probably be drinking. So overall, just a bad idea. She got huffy and said that she would let me borrow her car if I needed it. I wouldn't ask my sister to drive her car just to go out and party. I would potentially ask if it was an emergency or if I needed to get to work, and if she needed it for those reasons, I would let her borrow my car. Not to party.\n\nI put my foot down and said she could take her car, or our mother's. I also blurted that she should've gotten her light fixed. She didn't say anything and left the house in anger. Some time later, a mutual friend of ours texted me, asking why I didn't give her my car. She went and told this person everything, and now he was taking her side. I wanted to tell him it was none of his business and it was between my sister and I. But I didn't say that and just said I didn't think it was a good idea. He responded that I was her sister and shouldn't let her drive without a headlamp. If it was such a problem, why didn't HE pick her up since HE has a car.\n\nThis situation has frustrated me deeply, and several people are saying I should've let my sister drive my car. I've done a lot for my sister over the years, but the one time I put up a boundary, I'm painted as the bad guy. It makes me feel bad. Like I've been taken advantage of throughout my life. But maybe I am the asshole here.\n\nSo AITA, or am I justified in denying my sister my car?",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for refusing to move back in with my dad even though he says he’s “not responsible for me anymore” if I don’t?\n\nI (19F) grew up in a very unstable household. My parents were constantly on and off — like a cycle. My dad would go out partying, drink, go to bars, and come home in awful states. My mom would leave him, and somehow he would always manipulate her into coming back with promises of change. But he never changed. The cycle repeated over and over and over.\n\nI was the quiet kid growing up. I never really got into arguments with my dad like my mom and sibling did. I was always just in my room, observing everything from the sidelines, trying to stay invisible and out of the way. But even as a bystander, I was affected. Watching that kind of instability messes with you, even if you’re not the direct target.\n\nRight now, the cycle is happening again. My dad is trying to convince my mom to come back — and she’s agreeing to. But I’ve told them both that I don’t want to go back and live with him. I’m hurt. I’m scared of him. And I don’t feel emotionally safe in that space.\n\nHere’s where things get messed up:\nMy dad sat me down and gave me an ultimatum. Either I come back to live with him, or he’s “no longer responsible for me.” So I told him I’m not moving back in, but I’m willing to come by and stay some nights just to keep the peace. That was my compromise.\n\nNow he’s blaming my mom, saying she’s the reason we all left him and that we don’t have a relationship. But that’s just not true. He never takes accountability for the things he did. And even now, he still sees me as a child who should obey him — not someone with valid pain and reasons.\n\nI feel so conflicted.\nOn one hand, I know I’m protecting myself.\nBut on the other hand, I’m being made to feel like I’m the problem — like I’m being cold, or disrespectful, or tearing the family apart.\n\nSo Reddit…\nAITA for refusing to move back in with my dad, even if it causes drama and he cuts me off?\nWas agreeing to sleep there occasionally just enabling the cycle again?\n\nI genuinely don’t know. I just feel tired and stuck.\n\nPS:my brother is 20 and also doesn't see himself living there again.\n",

I had my baby shower last weekend and it was a great event, but there was one interaction that I may be the asshole for.  \n\nMy husband showed up for the gift portion.  When opening gifts, one gift was a baby care package and a onesie to the rival college my husband and I went to. It was given to us by a friend who went to said rival college.   My Husband has a pretty deep hatred of the rival school. I follow along with that since fall saturdays at football games is our thing.    \n\nWhen we opened this gift, my husband audibly said \"oh\". I could see the \"what the fuck \" look on his face.   I said, I hope a gift receipt came with this!  I thought it was a gag gift.  My friend says \"oh no gift receipt\".  I was like, oh well, \"Sons Name\" is never going to wear this. Then moved on to the next gift.  Little awkward, but whatever.  After the party, my husband threw the onesie in the trash.  \n\nA few days ago someone asked what happened with the onesie and I told them.  Well that made it around to a few people and I get a text from the friend saying that i'm a huge asshole.  I should have just given it back to her.  I was like thats what the gift receipt comment was for and told her my husband would never allow our son to be dressed like that.  I never thought it was supposed to be a legitimate gift, but apparently it was.  AITA?",
