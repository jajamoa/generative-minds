      "scenario_description": "I’m 22 and staying with my parents over the summer before going back to school out of state for my senior year. \n\nYesterday I was at the gym and at about 5:30pm got a text from my mom asking if I’d be home soon so she could look at photos I’d taken of her on a recent trip we went on. I got home at 6:30 pm and quickly took a quiz for an online class and then got ready to leave because I’d promised a friend I’d meet her at her house by 7:30pm and she lives about 20 minutes away. \nAt about 7:05, my mom asked if she could look through the photos. I didn’t really want her looking through my entire phone because I could have screenshots of texts between friends or other random embarrassing stuff that I just wouldn’t want her seeing. So I told her that I was just about to head out because I had plans at 7:30, and that I would send her the photos the second I had a free minute. \n\nShe proceeded to go upstairs and bang on the bathroom door and yell at me as I finished getting ready, telling me to just give her my phone and that she needed the photos now. I went silent for a minute because I was kind of shocked that she was yelling at me suddenly and I didn’t want to say anything that could be rude. \n\nShe then took my car keys that I had left on the table so that I couldn’t leave the house. I don’t really think this is appropriate at all since I’m 22 and not a child. Even if she was frustrated, it is no longer her responsibility to discipline me as if I were a teenager, especially over photos I said I would send. \n\nI asked her if she had seen my keys and she told me she had taken them and would not give them back until I sent the photos of her. I told her this wasn’t appropriate to do. She continued to yell at me while I kept my voice low and didn’t cut her off or interrupt even when she was cutting me off. \n\nI had my phone recording the interaction because I’ve gotten sick of the way she acts towards me and honestly wanted to confide in a friend afterwards and ask if she thought I did anything wrong. My mom got very mad about that and I honestly understand where she’s coming from but also if she’s treating me in a way that she’s so terrified for anyone else to see, maybe she needs to be kinder. \n\nAnyway, I end up texting her the photos because she refused to give me my keys until I did. She tells me these “aren’t the right photos” and I tell her they’re the only ones I have. She tells me that isn’t true so I once again check my camera roll and tell her these are still the only photos I have of her and that I would like my keys back. She continues to try to argue with me over whether or not I have more photos of her, all while my poor friend is expecting me. \n\nBefore she hands me my keys back, she tells me that I’m disgusting, disgraceful, and that she’s embarrassed that I’m her daughter… \n\nEdit: I’m taking one online class over the summer but during the school year I’m in person full time. When I saw her text I didn’t respond, I left it on delivered under the assumption that I would see her when I got home, but I prioritized what I needed to get done over sending her the photos. She did also tell me after taking my keys away that there was someone who needed the photos so that they could be posted to a board she’s a part of. By the time she finally gave me back my keys, it was 7:40 and I was extremely late to meeting my friend. I did what she asked not because I thought her behavior was okay, but because I’d made a commitment to a friend and knew that unfortunately, the only way I would be getting my keys back, was if I did what she wanted from me. I do have concern about how complying with her bs encourages her behavior to continue but I’m unsure what other option I have, because if I don’t comply her behavior will escalate into more yelling, screaming, probably slamming/throwing things, etc. I feel that my best option here is to keep my stuff away from her reach and decrease contact once I am no longer sharing a roof with her.

      "scenario_description": "Recently I bought a new, cheaper car and was telling my friends about it. There were a few of us talking and I was excited to share it with them because having my old car put a lot of financial strain on me and this new one was much more affordable. My friends knew that I was under some financial strain so they were happy for me. \n\nOne of my friends quickly started asking about money. In the past he has come off kind of judgemental about finances. He's been in a pretty good situation for a while and I've been struggling to get off the ground. He asked specific questions like, How much did you pay upfront? How much did your dad help you? How much did they give you for your trade in? \n\nI realize that these are pretty normal things to ask but I kept giving non specific answers to the questions, replying with answers like, not much, a lot, a good amount. I just didn't feel like answering the questions in the moment, I felt kinda vulnerable and just wanted to be excited about the car.\n\nAfter I gave another non specific answer he asked me why im dodging his questions and I just said because its not really his business. He said hes my friend not just anyone and I told him I know that but money has been tight for a while and has become a bit of a sore subject. I said I appreciate that hes my friend but I just don't want to talk numbers right now. \n\nAfter that he kinda went quiet and didn't say much to me for the rest of the night. Im worried that I offend him and I was being rude. So am I the ass hole for telling my friend I don't want to talk numbers about my new car?",

That class is totally fine as I’m properly enrolled and everything.\n\nBut I’ve also been sitting in on another class at the same college just because I’m really interested in the subject. I’m **not** enrolled in that one, and technically the college rules say you’re not allowed to attend classes you’re not registered for. But it’s kind of an open secret that lots of students do it, and most professors either don’t notice or don’t care. So I figured it was harmless.\n\nThe class is large (maybe 50 people), and I sit in the front row, and I ended up becoming friends with the only other person in front. So I’m pretty visible to the professor.\n\nI sometimes use my phone during class—usually to look things up, but also occasionally just to scroll if the lecture gets slow or repetitive (e.g. when someone asks a stupid question or the professor is going over something I already know). Everyone else is on laptops or iPads, and I didn’t think using a phone was that different.\n\nBut the other day I had to miss class, and my friend told me the professor went on a **3-minute rant** about how phones aren’t allowed in class, how it’s in the syllabus, and how he wants to report the person using one. My friend said it was *definitely* about me because no one else uses a phone and he ranted just when I was gone.\n\nHere’s the thing: I never saw the syllabus because I’m not actually in the class. I didn’t realize phone use was such a big deal. I’m not earning credit or anything, I just wanted to learn.\n\nAITA?",

      "post_title": "AITA for not agreeing to send gift money for my husband’s niece’s wedding?",
      "scenario_description": "I(35F) and my husband(33M) are married. He has 3 sisters and 3 brothers. We live in the USA but both from a country in EU. His family always considers us rich because my family is a bit wealthier compared to his (not significantly on paper) and likes sharing gifts. A small background, since we got married his family almost didn’t get us anything including the wedding gift but expected from us. Their reasoning is that we have ability to buy those since we live in the USA. Well, I disagree bc we are barely getting by financially since we are paying student debts, moved to another state, my husband was unemployed for a few months, and his business got some problems which created extra financial stress. On top of that, we had a newborn. They did not send anything as a gift for our newborn. Not a single item, and what’s worse is they didn’t even bother to check. Besides these, my personal feeling is that if someone cannot bother doing something nice for me, then I don’t want to go above and beyond for them. But at the end, we ended up sending gifts or doing favors for his family with nothing in return. \n\nAnyway, My husband’s niece(the older sister’s daughter) is getting married in 2 weeks, and today I saw my husband was texting with his youngest sister about asking some bank info. When I asked him why, he said it was to send money for his niece’s wedding. I was taken aback and snapped that they didn’t even send something for our little baby and we agreed on how bad this was. He said he doesn’t care what they do, it was his responsibility for his niece. I didn’t make it a big deal at the moment since my mom was in the room and I didn’t want her to hear our conversation. \n\nNow, I feel betrayed. The reasons are first, he never asked for my permission since we always take financial decisions together even though it’s not a big amount. Second, we both agreed how hurt we were when they didn’t send us an even small gift for our baby. Considering that not only my close relatives but also distance relatives send us many gifts. Not all of them were expensive stuff. I am not asking something pricey at all, something heartfelt like a small toy or a nice clothes would do it for me. \n\nWe didn’t have a conversation yet but would I be AITA if I tell him I don’t agree with him for sending money for his niece’s wedding gift after we did not get anything for our wedding and baby?\n\nEdit: I wanted to provide a few things. First, I am not native in English so I may use some words in a different meaning. Second, by gift giving, I meant it’s in our culture. If there is a big life event such as wedding or having baby, we are expected to gift in terms of money. And culturally, it’s transactional. For example, if my cousin gets married, my parents and I need to gift some money, let’s say $100. Then, if I get married, my aunt and my cousin needs to gift something with the same value. His siblings except 2 of them did not gift anything for our wedding. They also didn’t buy a small gift such as blanket or some household items. But after the wedding, we sent them many things for their kids/themselves. When our baby arrived, they didn’t even bother sending a $10 toy or clothing item. Those are the things I would expect at bare minimum to think that they care about us. I am not behind huge amounts of money. \n\nOne his siblings, youngest sister, she doesn’t have means to give them even small gifts, but I always make sure she gets something bc she shows she cares about us by constantly calling or sending homemade items. My main argument was that why we would go above and beyond while they don’t show us they care about us. Just wanted to update.\n\nAlso, yes my husband is entitled to his own beliefs and feelings. But taking an action without a discussion was why I got mad. We both agreed that we would stop providing for them bc we don’t get anything in return emotionally. I don’t want a relationship with anyone where I am the only giver. ",

We rely on each other to cover shifts when life happens, and I’ve always been covering for coworkers emergencies, staying late, you name it. One coworker, Jake (30M), has a reputation for being unreliable. A few months ago, he begged me to take his closing shift because he had a family emergency. I rearranged my plans, covered for him, and later found out he just wanted to go to a concert. I was annoyed but let it slide. Last week, Jake asked me to swap shifts so he could attend a friend’s birthday party. I’d have to work a double shift on my only day off that week, which I’d planned to spend with my sister who’s visiting from out of town. I politely said no, explaining I had plans. Jake got upset, saying I was being selfish and that “we’re supposed to be a team.” He even brought it up in front of our manager, who didn’t take sides but seemed annoyed at the drama.\n\nAITA for refusing to swap shifts with Jake?",

My parent’s home is messy & dirty cause of my dad. Floors are always caked with dirt, sink's full of dishes within one day, & repairs are unfinished for YEARS. My mom's given up keeping up with cleaning cause my dad's so bad about it. And to be honest, I don’t blame her.\n\nSince I was little, things that needed repair would be ignored or “temporarily fixed.\" I used to share a room with my sis till I was 20, & repairs were neglected to the point where it was a liability. The floor was caving in multiple spots, AC was broken, one wall wasn’t grouted (a half finished fix), door wouldn’t close all the way, & mold was in the closet for 10 yrs. Dad recently fixed it for my sister & she now has a very nice room, but the severity of the damage was very worrying. This is super ironic cause my dad's a contractor. Literally could make a house from scratch with the knowledge he has & does it for a living. \nMy dad would always say, “it doesn’t matter what it looks like as long as it works,” or, “I’ll finish it later,” but he never does. Ever. \nThe shower in my trailer hasn’t worked for two years. Dad said he’d order parts, but never did. So I’m forced to use the shower in the house. My AC's jammed into my bedroom window with duct tape, moldy cardboard, & a flimsy wooden board. \n\nFast forward to this week, my dad got a good paycheck. This gave him the idea to get the house cold air. This is the first time we’ve had air in the main room since we moved in 14 years ago. He went & made everyone else’s rooms look nice while installing it. He initially bought an AC for the Livingroom, but changed his mind & got central air instead. He asked me if I wanted to replace my gross AC for the one he bought. I said sure, thinking he was gonna make it look nice like he did for my mother and sister. But he came in and put put nasty duct tape & a dirty green board on my wall to hold it up. I told him it looked just as bad as before, & of course, as always he says, “as long as it works, that’s all that matters.\" When asked about the green board, he said, “you’re an artist. Paint it or something.” (I am an artist.) I was upset that he didn’t put any effort into it, but did a great job for my mom & sister’s room. When I got up to go tell my mom, I noticed my father left a HUGE puddly, muddy trailed mess on my floor after I JUST deep cleaned recently & swept my floors this morning. I always try to keep it nice & neat in my personal space to have an escape from the hell that is my parent’s home. When I told my mom & sister about how upset this made me, they said their room looked like that for the longest time, so it’s normal & I shouldn’t be upset that I got a whole new AC. I know I should be grateful, but my father has never once made an effort to make my space look nice, & it’s hurtful he made an effort for everyone else but me. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My wife (32f) and I (35m) were recently on vacation over the 4th of July, which also happens to be my wife's birthday. We had all the normal traditions for our family, including cake. We all had a piece day-of but almost nobody ate cake the entire rest of the trip. When the time came to return home, in-laws (MIL made the cake) offered to send the whole thing with us because they \"didn't need all that and we will probably just throw it away.\" My wife hates food waste, so she brought it. The journey home was two days by car. It has since been two additional days since we got back. Each night after dinner, I've had a reasonably sized piece of the cake for desert. I used to be a bigger guy and while I have much better habbits now, I still have a soft spot for baked goods...the cake was \"budgeted for\" though and I had been looking forward to eating a little. Well today my wife saw that there was only one slice left and was irate... Saying I was completely selfish and had eaten almost all of HER cake. I told her the cake had been available to all for nearly a week (counting days it sat on the counter before we took it home with us) and that nobody had bothered to touch it but me. I did apologize after she finished explaining to me that it upset her but I dont understand why it's such a big deal to begin with. The cake was right there...she never even had a bite.\n\nFor additional context, in the past she has requested that certain foods be saved for her as leftovers etc. Ive obliged, only for that food to sit until it had become moldy and she claims she \"forgot it was in there, oops.\" For someone who hates food waste, allegedly, I find this behavior doubly puzzling... Was I wrong here?\n\nEdit to answer some recurring questions:\n\nIt isn't, nor has ever been a \"my cake\" or \"your cake\" situation in our family. Its just THE cake, to be shared. There has never been an expectation beyond making sure the birthday person gets the first slice. After that, its just a regular old cake.\n\nThe courtesy some are relaying is to simply ask if she wanted a slice while im serving myself. In our home, this has never really been a consistent thing. It does happen, but its not an expectation and doesnt happen every time. Desserts are just understood to be periodically available and if you want some, its there. Different rules for small children notwithstanding...\n\nFinally...we ate on the drive. Idk why people exclude those two days from when the cake was available. Obviously we didn't drive 48 hours straight without sustenance... and the first night we obviously had to park and rest somewhere. And besides that we were home for dinner on the second day as well.\n\nUpdate: I have decided to simply bake her the exact same cake, in a smaller tin just for her. It will be her cake and nobody else will touch it. If it gets wasted, so be it. I hate the waste but its not worth the division.\n\nUpdate 2: the remade cake was much appreciated. She has yet to take a single bite. Not going to track progress. The cake was made as an apology, not to test the theory. This is the final update. ",

We had a nice visit then started the long drive back home. Midway through, in the middle of absolutely nowhere on a road with next to no traffic, we pulled over to pee on the side of the road. Nobody was exposed in the slightest. Of course this is when a car comes along. This insane woman put her window down and started yelling about “pissing perverts”. My brother had an exchange with her. She sped off. \nA half hour later we get pulled over. Seems this woman made a complaint about not only indecent exposure, but also said we had a kidnapped child in the back seat, and were driving very recklessly. I was driving at this point. It was my brother’s car. The cop held us up for a while and my brother had to prove that the child was in fact his daughter. Next time I’ll just piss my pants I guess. AITA? ",

      "post_title": "AITA for locking myself in my office when we have company?",
      "scenario_description": "I 36 F took in my mother during the pandemic after some medical issues. I never made her move out after, It works for us, she has her own bedroom and bathroom, we share other spaces and I work from home most of the time so I can look after her. My stepdad died about a decade ago and she was lonely. It made sense for us.\n\nAs mentioned I work from home most of the time and a lot of times i'm in some kind of teams meeting or call (yes even those that could be emails but thats not important). So I don't really have time for chitchat during office hours. My mom's sister aka my aunt tends to drop by unannounced to visit with my mom. Which I don't really mind, but she had a tendancy  to step into my office without knocking while i'm working and start talking to me about her neighbors sisters kid who did bla bla bla. I've more than once explained to her that I'm working and or I'm on a call and I can't really chat right now. But she just keeps talking like nothing happened.\n\nToday she actually announced to my mom she was coming over. I reminded my mom to tell her I'm working and on calls and can't be disturbed and my mom agreed she would tell her not to bother me. But just to be safe I locked my office door so she couldn't walk in.\n\nDespite my mom telling her, she came upstairs and tried to open the door, when it didn't open she started knocking and calling out hello it's me open up. I didn't respond at first as I was on a call with a client but she kept banging on the door so loudly I ended up having to put the client on hold. I told her without opening the door I was on a call and could not talk right now and my aunt left in a huff. Now she's bombarding my mom with texts about how rude I was for locking myself in my office knowing I was having company.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nUpdate: Go to dinner for a few hours, return to reddit only to find out this has exploded. First of all thank you all for your confirmation that this isn't on me. I did not think I was the asshole, but there's always that hint of doubt where you're like hmmm maybe I should have poked my head out and said hello real quick, but the truth was it was a busy day today and I just hadn't had the time.\n\nNow for the update: After I finished my workday, I took my mom out for dinner and we discussed the matter. She hadn't responded to any of her sisters (my aunt's) texts because she is fully on my side. I know people are asking why my mom didn't stop her, my mom isn't very mobile anymore and my aunt simply got up from her seat and took off upstairs despite my mom's warning.\n\nWe discussed it over dinner and we agreed that my aunt simply is no longer welcome during office hours, since it's the only way to stop this behaviour, either she can pick up my mom to go to a coffee shop and talk, come after office hours, or come over on the one day I work in office. My aunt seems pretty pissy about it, calling their brother (my uncle) to complain also, but he texted me earlier saying he told her how wrong she was and apparantly her husband had also told her she was wrong so now she's currently stomping her feet at home because everybody is saying she's wrong. Delightfull woman she is... remind me to one day post the story about her disneyland trip.\n\nAnyways TLDR: Mom and I decided she's no longer welcome at my house during office hours.\n\nUpdate to the update: This is the cliffnotes version of the Disneyland story \n\nShe has twin boys, and for their birthday she booked a trip to take them an one of their friends out to disneyland. The friend ended up cancelling last minute and told me if I paid the friends share I could go. Reasonable enough , I figured why not. (I was 16 at the time this story is like 20 years old) I'm european so this is disneyland Paris i'm talking about, and I'm not from France so this is a international trip (this becomes important later) my cousins are maybe 10ish at this point. So anyways we're in the parks and she has been a menace all trip already but i'm dealing with it. It's the last day about 5 hours before we have to take our train back home (international traveling train with customs etc like a plane would be only less boarding time)\n\nOne of my cousins wants to go on the rock and roll rollercoaster the other one doesn't. The line is like 5 minutes or less so my aunt tells me to go with him and she'll wait at the exit with our bags. So I leave my bag containing my phone my ID my money EVERYTHING in her care.\n\nTen minutes later me and my cousin get out of the ride, and she is GONE. So I start looking around, cannot find her, after half an hour of waiting (maybe they went to the bathroom or something) still nothing. We go check the bathrooms, neighboring rides the works no aunt. I have no phone on me to call her, and with us having to leave for the train in 4 hours I get nervous. I'm a 16 year old with a ten year old at my hand and no money no ID no phone nothing.\n\nSo I decide to go to the lost kids department and explain my situation. They end up calling her through the parks intercom.. another hour goes by... no Aunt. I remember my dad's phone number back home so I use Disney's land line to call him, he tries calling her cellphone my cellphone no response whatsoever. At this point I have like an hour or less before the train leaves and i'm in hystericals because I can't board this train without money or ID let alone with another minor. My cousin at this point seeing my panic is crying his eyes out so i'm also dealing with a scared child i'm barely an adult myself.\n\nMy dad eventually tells me it makes no sense for him to drive out to Paris right now, to go back to our hotel he'll pay for another night and he'll come pick us up in the morning. So I take my cousin back to the hotel explain the situation and the receptionist hears me say my name and says:\" Oh sweetheart I have a note for you\" it's a note from my aunt: Gone to dinner see you on the train...\n\nAt this point I have half an hour to run to the station , hoping we'll still get through customs where she's supposed to be waiting. I make it with 15 minutes to spare i'm out of breath, and FUMING. We end up making it through customs god only knows how and manage to get on the train literally as the doors close on us. I call my dad explain the update and he is also fuming at this point. To which my aunt turns to me and goes: I don't know why you're so mad, I left a note at the hotel and I brought you something to eat and hands me a freaking dinner roll..\n\nI took my stuff, went to the dining car with my cousin who she also almost abandonned and gave him the biggest slice of chocolat cake my budget could buy and never came back to our seats to talk to her xD",

Today i thought we would finally have a peaceful morning; until she started asking questions.

She then pried with that topic until i got overwhelmed and left unprompted. \n\nI was in the bathroom trying not to stress about it until i heard her talking to my grandma about how i was wasting my potential of being bilingual by going for a “useless, low sought after degree” and should go into a medical or law field (i’ve told her before that i would much rather not get into medicine before.) since coding wouldn’t get me anywhere especially if it was for “silly little video games”; which was what i was currently looking into as an excuse since i didn’t know what i wanted to get into coding specifically. \n\nI don’t even know what i want anymore. It just feels like she just wants something to show off to relatives. \n\nedit; no i wasn’t crying at the mention of a job, as stated i do want to get one but its impossible with how custody is and my lack of driving skills; i was crying at the fact that my mother was asking me a lot of questions while also downplaying my CURRENT college interests.",

      "scenario_description": "Hi 24M. I know this needs context, so I'll try and make it simple. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are just getting to the point of taking showers with each other while we're at each others places. The current problem I'm having is that I was on the toilet doing my business, when I was done I did the required paper work and then washed my hands. That all sounds normal to me. My girlfriend was in the bathroom with me, do to us getting ready to take a shower together. \n\nShe watched me wash my hands and asked me what I was doing, then scolded me for it. He logic was that since we were getting in the shower, washing my hands was pointless. I thought she was joking, so I laughed and said that was gross. I'm not touching anything with my soiled hands like that. She interpreted that as me calling her gross. \n\nSo I had to ask, does she always get right into the shower after using the toilet without washing them first? Apparently she doesn't wash her hand. She just gets right into the shower. Now I'm somehow an asshole because I don't want to spread my poop germs around my bathroom more than what flushing already does. \n\nNow it's turned into an argument. We didn't shower together and instead of having a nice day like we planed, I drove her home.\n\nI don't get it, who doesn't wash their hand immediately after wiping? If I'm home, I don't even pull my pants up until I wash my hands. \n\nI asked a few guy friends about it and they're all on my side, so I thought it might be a girl thing. So I called the only girls in my life i can ask such a stupid question. First i tried my older sister 38F, to which i got scolded for even considering not washing my hands. The lady practically raised me. Then I tried my younger sister 22F, she was on my girlfriends side. So I don't know.\n\n  \nAITA for washing my hands after using the bathroom even though I was getting in the shower anyways? ",

      "scenario_description": "Previously good neighbor relationship. Next door neighbor on left of us is 75, had hip replacement two years ago. I’ve helped him off the ground twice now after he has fallen in his own yard. Neighbor on right was renter, moved out a month ago. Landlord is out of state, has not been back to see the house since they moved out. I came home to see elderly neighbor was struggling to cut the foot-high grass at the renters house, and had “trimmed” our grass along the sides of our house and sidewalk down to the soil with a weed whacker. I approached nicely, advised I was worried because it is 90 degrees and I did not want him to fall or get overheated. He said he was fine. I then overstepped my bounds and asked if he had permission to cut the renters lawn. He said no. Then I really opened my mouth and advised if he starts cutting the landlord’s property for free, they will come to expect it all year. I received a glare. I told him thank you for trying to help, I know he means well, but please ask permission before doing work on other peoples properties. We take a lot of pride in our yard and enjoy doing it ourselves. Elderly neighbor told me he does not want our neighborhood going downhill, he will cut it if he wants to, and walked back into his house. \n\nI know I said too much. I hurt his pride. Grass will grow back - I am more afraid of him falling and breaking another hip! \n\nWas there a better way I should have handled this?",

As I cannot afford to nor am I ready to get any sort of surgical procedures, I have been slowly trying to socially transition since I discovered myself at 16, and came out to my immediate family (Bio father, bio mother, and step father) at 17. \n\nI've chosen a name that resonates with me and I feel comfortable using in online spaces and with friends in school, (I have graduated but will present myself this way when I enter college). \n\nWhen I came out to my bio father, it was already a difficult conversation as he continues to misgender me, and told me he'll accept me but I'll \"always be his daughter\". And when I came out with a new name, he immediately said no. \n\nHe said no, as (prior to me even existing, therefore not even knowing this information) he knew someone with the same name, who did something horrible that I will not say here as it isn't necessarily my business, but it is disgusting. \n\nAs for my step father and bio mom, they said no because a member on my step father's side of the family uses that name, as it is his middle name and he prefers it over his first name that he doesn't like much. \n\nI feel guilty for choosing this name, as I don't want my family to feel uncomfortable with the separate associations. However, it's a name I feel comfortable using and had an odd time getting used to.

      "scenario_description": "I (21m) was hanging out with my closest friend group (5 guys total) I’ve had since high school when something odd happened. Suddenly, after years of using the word himself (and all of us regularly using it), one friend (D) was taken aback by another friend (N) saying the word “retarded.”\n\nHe made a big deal of it being a “slur” and shamed N for using it liberally. When N questioned this shift, D replied, “Why use a slur? It’s just not cool to say anymore.”\n\nFor context, we’ve been super close since freshman year of high school. Now, the summer before senior year of college, we’re still close but less so due to naturally attending different schools. We used to hang out every weekend—smoking weed, drinking beers, playing Super Smash Bros, DnD, etc. We’re not big “trash-talkers” either; growing up in a nice area with solid education instilled values of kindness and respect. We’re mostly just goofy nerds.\n\nThere’s an unspoken understanding that we’re generally left-wing. Growing up in progressive areas instilled these ideals. I’ve personally shifted slightly toward the center after finding my place in the world, but I remain a big proponent of basic human rights and equality. Same goes for everyone else in the group. When we made “edgy” jokes, it was always understood as satire—funny because it’s opposite of our real beliefs. For example, making Hitler jokes since 4 out of 5 of us are Jewish.\n\nNow, six years later, there’s a sudden shift in group vibe—not because N and I desperately need to say “oh that was retarded” during Smash, but because there’s now tension and authority in the group. D and another guy (R) are suddenly very anti-slur, while N and I (still quite left-wing in our beliefs) see no issue as long as these words aren’t used derogatorily. That just wouldn’t be cool. The last guy (J) seems neutral—probably doesn’t care about “slurs” and just wants to have fun.\n\nNo one even used “retard” specifically to be funny. Maybe in funny situations, sure, but it’s more synonymous with “stupid” than purely for shock value. The sudden contempt for this usage seems to give D and R an air of superiority, as if censoring these words makes them more mature. If it slips now, the vibe immediately feels off (though we avoid comments or lectures if lucky).\n\nAm I the asshole, or does D’s sudden judgment of “retard” stem more from conformist indulgence in censorship among modern leftists rather than a genuine push for good?\n\nI understand removing it from medical dictionaries since it’s antiquated. I’d never use it for someone with disabilities. But bringing woke rules into a chill night with the boys? Seems retarded.",

      "scenario_description": "I (34M) just came back from visiting some friends in NYC. Over the long weekend, we went to maybe half a dozen bars/restaurants.\n\nPersonally, I love trying new beers. If I see a place has one I've never had, I'm definitely going to order it (and log it on Untappd)!\n\nSometimes a bar menu is out of date and they don't have that beer anymore. Thats never a problem for me, and I just order something else. I always make a point to be polite and lighthearted whenever ordered too. This weekend I ran into a string of bad luck though. \n\nOne place had to dig around for a while for a stout. That makes sense since thats more of a winter beer, and I thanked them profusely and tipped extra.\n\nA second place had a beer on tap that apparently few people order. They said they'd have to change the keg if I wanted a pint, but I said not to worry and ordered something else.\n\nAt the third place, I'm worried I took it too far. It was a sit-down restaurant with a server taking drink orders. On their menu they had two beers I hadn't seen before.\n\nI ordered one, and the server had to go and check with the bartender if they still had it. She came back saying they didn't carry it anymore, so I asked for the other one. Again, she had to check. She came back with the other drinks, and profusely apologized, but their menu was out of date and they didn't have that one either.\n\nI apologized too, and made a light joke about poor luck which she seemed to laugh at. I then ordered a Yuengling (pretty common beer in the northeast, but not available at every bar, and it was also on the menu). Once again, she checked, came back, and they didn't have it either.\n\nAt that point, my friend piped up and said \"he'll have a Bud Lite\". I said sure, and off she went. As soon as she left, that friend said \"Can you please not make her job any harder than it needs to be? She has other tables, you know.\"\n\nI apologized, and it was a bit awkward after that. I made sure to be extra nice to the server and to tip well, but now I'm worried that I took up so much of her time.\n\nAm I the AH here? If a venue says they have something, i think its fair game to try to order it. Maybe I should have gotten a more standard beer after they didn't have the first one though?",

      "scenario_description": "So, my friend and I went to a party and I ended up pretty wasted...and I mean, out of control wasted (I don't have any recollection of what happened because I was too drunk). My friends helped me get home, so I arrived safely. However, after that, they scolded me for being an irresponsible drinker. I told them I was sorry and that I felt guilty. I acknowledge and am aware that I may have become too much of an inconvenience for them during that time (I forgot what I did, but based on their story, it seems I was). For background, they told me I cried too much for several reasons(probably from the things that I haven't healed from yet lol), vomited (they cleaned it), and just the typical blackout drunk where you can't stand straight, think straight.  \n  \nI was guilty. I know I can be an irresponsible drinker because I can't control my alcohol intake, and maybe, I've got too comfortable and dependent on them that I let myself let loose. I told them sorry after that and asked for any reconciliation just to get back to what they did for me. After all, I got home safe. They told me it was fine and that maybe next time, I should stop drinking too much. \n\nNow, the problem is, it's been days, and after that talk, they haven't talked to me again. Maybe I am just overthinking this, but it feels strange for the reason that my friends and I talk all the time, and now it's just silent. Plus, I saw an ig post of one of our mutuals saying that they are talking about something, and I thought, why haven't they included me? I am probably overthinking this, but I feel so guilty and just sad. Is it fair for me to feel this way, or am I just the asshole because I did cause them trouble?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (26f) got married last month and I (29f) thought everything went ok. She had a beautiful venue, but I thought her wedding was a bit trashy.\n\nHer dress was beautiful if cheap. It was a midi dress with off the shoulder sleeves. I advised her to cover her arms because she’s got a “patchwork” tattoo sleeve on her left arm and I asked her if she really wanted a mouse in a party hat or a cowboy cat in her wedding photos. To which she said, “I think it’ll look sick as hell.”\n\nShe looked beautiful on her wedding day aside from her tattoos and the bit of rodent pee she got on her dress from when she insisted on taking pictures with her “babies”.\n\nThen for the reception she ordered pizza and had a Walmart sheet cake. Why? So she could spend money on a bounce house and ballpit.\n\nI thought the worst part of her wedding was that she didn’t allow kids to come to save money and because in her words “kids can be attention whores”. So I had to pay $100 for a sitter in addition to the $200 I gave them as a wedding gift.\n\nAt the end of the night, she and a bunch of party guests ended up jumping into the pool at her hotel because she “thought it would be fun” and bribed the night manager at the hotel to open the pool again so they could swim for a bit which I thought was rude. So her wedding dress and her husband’s suit was ruined from that.\n\nYesterday, we were going through the photos and she said that she had the time of her life and everything went perfect. I mentioned that I thought it was a bit immature and she said I was just a stick in the mud and if I could let loose for 5 minutes, I could’ve had fun too. I tried to show her where I was coming from but her husband stepped in and said if I didn’t have anything nice to say, I shouldn’t say anything at all and that even his 5th grade students knew that. I didn’t say anything else about it but what she said still kinda hurts.\n\nAITA for saying that I though my sisters wedding was immature and trashy?",

      "scenario_description": "so my brother (25m) had some pizza left over from dinner last night. he put it in the airfryer, accidentally forgot about it, and burned it a bit. It was still mostly edible just a little hard. however, he threw it away in the trash. I (26m) walked in the kitchen, and noticed that he was making something new that wasn't the pizza. i inquire what happened, he told me he burned it and threw it away. i peek in the trash and its sitting right on top on a plastic bag. so as a joke i pulled it out and went \"its not that burnt\" and suggested feeding it to the dogs. he said no, that we should stop feeding the dogs table food (which is fair).\n\nit's then that i took a bite out of the crust before tossing it back in the trash, saying that i didnt mind it was burnt. he didn't think any of this was a joke whatsoever, and instead got instantly frustrated with me and said \"you aren't supposed to eat out of the trash\". seeing that he instantly got defensive, made me frustrated as well, so of course i exclaim \"it's just a joke, i don't understand why you're getting mad all of a sudden!\"\n\nHe tells me that I'm just deflecting, then I hit him back with the \"you're just deflecting yourself probably because you're sad you burned your pizza\". at this point he left the room.\n\nwhen i get back to my room i sit down at my pc and check discord. he had dropped a message in a public server explaining what happened to all our friends, and when I said \"oh my fucking god\" in the same chat he deleted both his original message and mine before any of our friends could see it.\n\nThere are a few factors at play here that for fairness I'll list them:\n\n* i’m a bigger guy, and i tend to make self-deprecating jokes about it. honestly, the trash pizza thing was probably just me leaning into the “haha i’ll eat anything” bit. i’m super self-conscious about my weight, especially when it comes to relationships or how people see me. so i usually just turn it into a joke to save face and move on.\n* my brother is *really* picky with food. like, chicken tenders, pizza, maybe spaghetti if he’s feeling adventurous. he only likes food made a specific way, and i think he feels kinda self-conscious about that too. like he thinks being picky makes him a burden or makes hanging out with people harder if food’s involved.\n* we also just... argue like idiots sometimes. instead of acting like adults, we both get defensive fast and go straight into “you did this wrong” mode. i’ve been trying to get better about it, but it’s still a problem for both of us. honestly, we probably both need therapy but i’m not here for advice on that\n\nwhat i wanna know is, am i the asshole for eating my brothers pizza out of the trash as a joke?",

      "scenario_description": "I got home from working a 12-hour shift. When I pulled up, I saw my husband and his friend cleaning out our basement. I thought to myself, “They’re working hard, so I’ll just go ahead and put the kids in the shower and to bed since he’s busy and will probably be tired when he’s done.”\n\nAnyway, I put the kids in the shower and decided to start getting ready for bed myself. I began taking my makeup off with an oil cleanser. While I was doing this, he walked in and turned on the shower. I asked him to please turn the shower off so I could wash the oil off my face and cleanse properly. I only asked because when the shower is running, the sink water turns cold.\n\nWe’ve gotten into it many times before for this exact reason. Washing my face is something I take seriously. It’s part of my routine, it helps me unwind, and I actually enjoy it.\n\nBut when I asked him to turn off the shower so I could finish (because I literally had oil in my eyes) he went off. He said I was being inconsiderate, that he was cold (from sweating and coming inside), and that I should have just wiped the oil off my face and waited for him to finish showering.\n\nThat sent me over the edge. It feels like he always chooses to come into the bathroom to shower, shave, or wash his hands when I’m in there washing my face. I’ve told him so many times that the water gets cold when something else is running. Tonight he even said, “People cold plunge; that’s what you should have done.”\n\nSo…. AITA\n\nEdited to add…. The door does NOT lock. ",

      "scenario_description": "So, the title kind of says it all. I’ve got this cousin, he’s pretty different from me, especially in how he talks and acts. I *have* a girlfriend, and even when I don’t, I’ve never talked about women the way he does. He’s always going on about intercourse, butts, and how he \"could’ve had a chance\" with someone.\n\nJust earlier, we were in line and he started talking to two girls. He was kind of rude at first, then started this awkward back-and-forth. They mentioned their friend was single, but it didn’t even register with him. Now he’s complaining, saying stuff like “They were into me” and “I coulda hit that.”\n\nLiterally last night, he was talking to a friend who’s moving soon. He said, “I’ll miss you, I’m sad now.” Then today, he admits he just wanted to sleep with her.\n\nNow he’s hyped about this 4th of July beach party—only to meet girls and “get butt.” I told him I don’t want to go, because I don’t. I’m not trying to be his wingman, especially when most of those girls are taller than me anyway. Now he’s calling his friends, saying I’m selling and that he can’t go without me. Claims other friends would’ve “had that locked.” (We're on a family vacation with our moms who planned for us all to see the fireworks together anyway, so its even more messed up. Not to mention, we're black in a VERY white area and I dont want him getting misjudged for his foolish flirting)\n\nEdit: For anyone who cares, the line about height was a joke. I didnt think it would be such a reaction as it was a part of one sentence. But I love my girlfriend, and it wasnt about my own attraction to randoms. \n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMy cousin’s practically obsessed with chasing women and sex, and now he’s mad I won’t be his wingman at a party.",

      "scenario_description": "My best friend (35f) and I (35f) have been good friends for a long time. In February of 2025 I asked her if she wanted to go on vacation someplace. She agreed, and I started looking - and found a caribbean cruise for $1500 after deposits and such. She agreed, and we stated that we would do 50/50 on everything.\n\nWhen I call to talk about the cruise, she doesn’t really seem excited to do it - nor do I feel like she is putting effort to get things together for the vacation. \n\nThe final payment date was May 14, 2025 - for the August 2025 sailing. I paid for the entire cruise because I wanted to pay it off. She told me she would pay me back for the cruise fare - but said she can’t right now due to financial stresses and being behind on bills. I assured her that we could accommodate things and she can pay for certain aspects that equal that of the cruise fare. She agreed. \n\nWe are both living on our own, so in the sense we probably have the same amount of expenses to pay. \n\n This past week has really stressed me out because check-in for the cruise was today (July 8) and she does not have a passport or real ID. It is far too late to do a passport and who knows what the actual wait time is for a real ID considering people are traveling a lot and with the May 7 change for domestic flights. \n\nOn top of this, we have been planning to purchase things for the cruise for a while, but I don’t want to be the only one paying for things considering she owed me $920 for the cruise fare. \n\nI was talking to my mom because I wanted advice and she told me that she would go with me on this cruise - and she would pay for things toward cruise that equaled the cruise fare since it was already paid. It got me really thinking that maybe I should plan one when my friend is more financially available. \n\nMy friend would not be able to pay for flights - which is important but even if she could - waiting for her new ID would stress me out bc she might not be able to board either way. \n\nAITA for taking my friend off the reservation and take my mom instead. I talked to her and told her I could cancel but I would lose even MORE money with the cancellation fee. She told me she would do a weekend on the town somewhere else. I feel really bad since we have planned this for a while, but I also don’t want to be overwhelmed or stressed having to pay her half of things along with my bills. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (18M) threw a birthday party for myself at our local mall with my close friend group (4 girls, all 17F, and one guy, 17M). We’re all in the same class and pretty close, so I only invited them.\nThere’s a classmate of ours, “Bob” (17M), who I’m not comfortable around because of things he’s done in the past. My friends know this. Despite everything, I’ve actually tried a few times to be friendly toward him, but it never worked.\nAt the party, we were sitting at a café when Bob suddenly showed up, pulled up a chair, and sat with us without asking. I was surprised and uncomfortable, but before I could say anything, one of the girls told me not to say anything because Bob would get sad. She said I should think about how I’d feel in his position and that he wouldn’t stay long.\n\nI told her it’s my birthday and I should get to decide who’s there. She said that didn’t justify treating someone badly and that since Bob is our classmate, we “owe it to him” to include him and that i should just get over it. I told her that if she cared so much, she could leave with him when I asked him to go. She got upset and said I should just wait it out.\nSo I waited — for about 40 minutes. The whole time, I was really uncomfortable while everyone chatted with Bob like he was invited. When we got up to leave the café, Bob followed us. I was about to ask him to leave when the same girl said that if I did, it would look like all of us wanted him gone.\n\nAt that point, my male friend asked if I wanted to hang out just the two of us, and I said yes ( he also didn't like the guy ) . So we quickly left together by just telling them that we had to leave. About 30 minutes later, the others called us, really angry that Bob realized what happened and that they had to “explain themselves.” They said I was an ass for abandoning them.\nI told them it was weird how they suddenly acted like Bob's friends even though none of them ever talked to him before — I was the only one who ever tried. They cared more about how they looked to him than about how I felt on my own birthday, or atleast what it felt like.\n\nLater, they texted me saying I was wrong for excluding a classmate and that I needed to accept him. They said I’ll have to work with people I don’t like in the future and asked me to think about how I’d feel in his shoes. I haven’t replied since then. Honestly they treat me in general really good they ask me to hang out with them ,even though they don't talk to me much there but it's normal since they are closer to each other than with me.\nSo, AITA? \n\n\nEdit: For clarification — when Bob first showed up, I whispered to the girl next to me (we were sitting at a -not too large but not small either' table, and Bob was on the opposite side) that I was going to ask him to leave. She immediately pushed back. I was trying to be quiet but not too quiet because I kinda wanted him to get that we were talking about him but not exactly hear what we were saying, in hope he understood that he wasn't welcomed.",

She offered to take me too if I needed anything from the store and I accepted. \n\nWhat's important to mention is that I get distracted easily, especially when grocery shopping, with all the noise and bright colors. \n\nThe store we went to is pretty small and there were quite a lot of people there today. We both went inside, my mother taking the shopping cart. At first we stayed together as we looked for everything we needed. I acted like I normally do and occasionally got distracted which meant she had to repeat some things. She seemed kind of upset, but I didn't really think much of it. I tried to lighten the mood with an inside joke that she usually laughs at, but she let me know she was just annoyed. \n\nShe told me to just go off on my own and look for what I need because I'm annoying her. A staff member and an elderly couple clearly heard that, because they were staring and the elderly woman shook her head. I then went off on my own, because I didn't wanna upset her any further, occasionally coming back to put my stuff into the cart. \n\nThen after I went back and forth a few times, she changed her mind and called me out for running off on my own and being way too fast and that it was stressing her out, again in a way that customers clearly heard. At this point I was pretty uncomfortable, because of the weird looks I got, but I did what mom asked of me and stayed by her side. We finally paid and left. \n\nI'm thinking of asking her why she felt the need to treat me like that in public, WIBTA? ",

Things kind of got weird between us when A & S asked if they could come stay at my beach house Fourth of July weekend from Thursday to Sunday. However, when they asked I had just left a really bad shift at work, and I also was complaining to them how I was basically working doubles all Fourth of July weekend. So when they asked I didn’t necessarily say no, but was kind of like well I’m working all weekend… and aren’t we doing something for S’s birthday the following weekend? I also offered for them to come the following weekend for S’s birthday and I would request off. But S said she didn’t know what she’s doing for her birthday so I never requested off and they were kind of upset at me for not wanting them stay with me Fourth of July, but I kind of felt like they were using me and it was just bad timing and whatever. Cut to this weekend I keep asking what S’s plans are for her birthday, so I knew when to request off work. It’s middle of the week at this point and my schedule is posted for the following weekend, which I am working. Cut to today (Tuesday), S wants to have a restaurant dinner for her 21st birthday Saturday night. I am working a new job and don’t really know the people well enough to ask them to cover for me, but I put my shift up and no one has picked it up. Also, I share a car with my parents (which they need) so I don’t have a way to get home, and now I feel like S is upset with me. I don’t know basically am I the asshole and should I just have had S come 4oJ to celebrate her birthday earlier?",

Before she left, she specifically told me not to do the dishes—she knows I’m a little OCD about cleanliness and I think she didn’t want me messing with her stuff.\n\nHere’s the thing though: when I got there, her sink was full of dirty dishes and absolutely swarming with gnats. I don’t mean a couple I mean tons. The smell alone was awful.\n\nI managed to ignore it the first night, but by the second night I couldn’t take it anymore. She didn’t even have soap or sponges, so I went out and bought dish soap, scrubbers, and some bleach. I washed all the dishes, scrubbed the sink, bleached the drain, and even set out a DIY gnat trap (apple cider vinegar with dish soap in a Tupperware with holes in the lid).\n\nNow she’s mad at me for cleaning it, saying I went against her wishes and invaded her space. But it was disgusting, and I was living there for a week.\n\nSo… AITA for cleaning out her sink?\n",

      "scenario_description": "I (23F) live with my 3 roommates Josh (19M), Amy (19F), and Anthony (60-ish??? M). Yes, it is an odd dynamic that I won’t get into.\n\nI rarely come out of my room, I’m an introvert and have really bad anxiety and I tend to feel like a shitty person if I even say one word out of place. Yesterday, however, I decided to come out of my room and interact. Originally when I came out it was just me and one person in the living room when everyone started coming home. Josh had over a mutual friend of ours named Chris (19 M) who I rarely see so I decided to stick around upstairs for a bit.\n\nWhile everyone was in the kitchen cooking Chris and I were on the couch playing a card game and in the middle of it Amy and her bf came home. This was my first time meeting him so he introduced himself and I moved on after the introductions. I’m not really good with people so I was mostly quiet with him. When we finished the game I started getting antsy, not liking how many people were around so I decided to break off into my room.\n\nThis morning Anthony told me I need to cut this “Jealousy” stuff out and stop competing with my other roommates. I didn’t understand what he meant and he explained it. I’m gonna try my best to recap it here. He told me that when Amy’s boyfriend came in I started to get louder and more high pitched and when I stopped getting attention I went back to my room. The only reason I got loud and high pitched was because I was getting into the game and I can get rambunctious without even noticing. He mentioned how both my roommates are in relationships and I’m acting jealous because I’m the only single one and even if I’m doing it subconsciously I need to look within and cut it out.\n\nI have AuDHD (Autism and ADHD) so I get loud when I’m excited and that can mean in or out of a game. I also have a hard time reading but as far as I know Chris and I were just having fun and I wasn’t acting much different. I can recognize when I have changed my tone or if I’m speaking louder than before.\n\nThis is all I can think about today and I can’t help but wonder if I really am doing something wrong. If I really am a bad friend or person. It feels like I’m always doing something wrong or people are misunderstanding me. Idk I just need some clarity or an outside perspective.\n\nSo, AITAH?\n\nTLDR: Roommates think I’m actually jealous over Amy’s bf because I was really loud while playing a card game",

      "scenario_description": "I (26F, french) am currently vacationing in Spain with my partner (31M, french and spanish). The weather is very hot right now, 40° in the shade.\n\nLast night, we went out to eat to a popular tapería (a bar-restaurant that serves tapas, aka small plates) but as we tried to walk in, I realized someone was blocking the door. It was a glass door and I could see there was plenty of room for the person to move to the side. Even though it was 21h (9 pm), the sun was still up and I was melting.\n\nIn spanish, I asked, several times : \"Excuse-me miss, can you please move so I can get in ?\" The lady turned her head to the side, saw me and ignored my plea.\n\nSo I opened the door slightly anyway to force her to move, and she finally stepped aside. My partner and I got in and stood to the side, away from the door so that the other couple behind us could get in as well. Then another lady comes up to me, and the following exchange ensued, in english :\n\n[American lady, judging by the accent] : Every seat is taken. There's no room to eat.\n\n[Me] : Yes, we'll have to wait. I just didn't want to wait outside.\n\n[American lady] : You can't sign your name or anything.\n\n[Me] : Sign my name ? Why would I sign my name ?\n\n[American lady] : *scoffs* On a waiting list, do you not have that where you're from ?\n\n[Me] *shake my head*\n\n[American lady] : Well you do know there are MANY countries where that's a thing, right ?\n\n[Partner] : Not in Spain.\n\n[Me] : That's fine, I just didn't want to wait outside and your friend was blocking the door.\n\n[American lady, sarcastically] : Well I'm sorry for my friend doing that to you.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nI believe she thought I was trying to get a seat before them, which is why she brought up the waiting list. However, that would never happen as the waiters had seen them and it would never cross my mind. We knew it was a popular restaurant and expected to have to wait. Last time we tried to eat there we gave up because the line was too long. However this time we only waited 5 minutes, and the americans got seated 2 minutes before us. \n\nHere's where I'm kinda doubting myself : I didn't need to get into the sign-in thing as it wasn't very important. My genuine confusion seems to have come off as condescension. As far as I knew until last night, you either get a reservation or you wait to be seated. I've never been to a restaurant where my name would be called out once it was my turn (like the numbered tickets in city hall ?). \n\nHowever, I also think these two women were very rude. \n\nSo AITA ?\n\n\nPS : It's irrelevant to the story, but I heard their order : they did it all in english, didn't even try to speak a little spanish (not even hola), and weren't very polite to the staff (didn't say please or thank you, used a commanding tone).",

      "scenario_description": "This will be a long one—sorry—but I want to be clear to avoid misunderstandings. It was my sister's birthday (she turned 32), and I (21) wanted to treat her to dinner at a Korean place we both like. We’re really close and usually have weekly sleepovers, though we missed the last two.\n\nAt dinner, she mentioned that her boyfriend (who I don’t like) sends regards, and as she lifted her phone to take a picture, I said, “Uuh, don’t—” meaning I didn’t want to be in the frame. She cut me off, saying she didn’t appreciate how openly I show my disdain. I froze and probably made a face, which she pointed out (this becomes relevant later).\n\nThe mood shifted more when she said, “But enough about me, let’s talk about you.” I’ve been struggling at university, failing three finals. I work full time and haven’t been keeping up. She’s offered support—even a place to live—but I like my current setup and don’t want to leave my best friend with all the rent.\n\nWhen I tried to acknowledge my own fault in failing, she interrupted again, talking about \"It doesn't matter\". I, maybe a bit sassily, said, “I wasn’t finished,” and that seemed to push her over the edge. Her tone got aggressive, she banged her chopsticks on her empty plate, and said some pretty harsh things, the worst of which was when she said, “Then everyone will blame me for not helping you.”\n\nI got teary (I’m very sensitive, especially with her), which made her angrier. She said I was “making a scene.” Later, she brought up my reaction to the photo and said I should manage my emotions better. I apologized; she did too, and her tone softened.\n\nBut I couldn’t shake the guilt and confusion I felt over the whole conversation. I told her I might skip the sleepover to reflect. She sped ahead, upset. At the bus stop, I glimpsed her phone: a message to her boyfriend saying I was “getting pissy over bullshit.” I muttered “Wow,” and she snapped, saying I invaded her privacy and ruined her birthday with my behavior.\n\nI know I wasn’t perfect but was I really that selfish and immature? I feel terrible and have been all over the place and I just need some advice, please reddit strangers :((",

For those who dont know, this is a small rectangular case that is affixed to the wall or doorframe that holds a scroll. We are supposed to have it by our front door. \n\nShe said it was fine. I ordered one and put it up. The mezuzah is supposed to tilt a little toward the door, and not be straight up and down. I hung it the correct way, and she got angry, saying she needed it to be straight. I informed her that it isn't traditionally hung that way. I did straighten it a little, but kept a slight tilt. She was still angry about it. Like, screaming angry. I reminded her that I endure the absolute explosion of christmas decorations every year, and never complain. And this was just a little piece of metal. She said this was different, since it set off her OCD. I said I would just take it down, then. \n\nSo I took it down, and there were holes in the wall where I had screwed it into the wall. I paid for maintenance to fill them, but the fill he used is a slightly different shade than the rest of the wall. Apparently that also sets off her OCD, and she is angry with me now. \n\nI was just so done with the whole situation, and said she really just needs to get over it. She said I was TA for saying that, since she has OCD. \n\nIs she right? ",

      "scenario_description": "So today I (M26) woke up to find that my mom had taken our recently deceased pet dog's stuff that we kept stored away and had given it to my current pet dog. Our family dog of 13 years, Caesar, died of cancer complication last October. At that time my sister and I were away at college so it was just my mom at home, meaning by herself she had to take care of him as his condition worsened and had to take him to be cremated after he passed. We were too poor to give him proper care or have him put down at the time. Our whole family was distraught, especially my sister and I as our Nana had passed away not even 6 months prior. We had agreed to keep Caesar's stuff stored away until my sister and I were able to move out on our own and take some of his stuff with us.\n\nNow while I was in College I ended up taking in another dog, Rusty, because Lubbock, TX is filled with strays and it just sort of happened because the pound refused to take him in. I was lucky enough to have roommates at my apartment who didn't mind me keeping him, that was in 2023. I graduated in December 2024 and I've moved back in with my mom until I'm able to get on my feet. While apprehensive at first, she ultimately agreed to let me bring Rusty home and has grown rather fond of him. \n\nThis morning she gave Rusty Caesar's old food & water bowl, as well as his old doggy bed. My sister is home for the summer and we were both less than happy to find this out. My sister is very conflict averse so didn't push back against my mom very much, I however, confronted her on the issue. My issue isn't really with her giving the stuff to Rusty, it's that she did it without consulting neither my sister or myself. During our argument she got upset saying I was disrespecting her, that she could have just thrown Caesar's stuff away, that I'm not her father, and that she doesn't need to ask our permission to do anything, and accusing me of emotionally manipulating her to force her to take in Rusty. Mind you that while I would have been upset to let Rusty go, I am not so ignorant of our situation that I would have refused to do it and I made sure talk to both her and my dad about it months beforehand. Her argument was that it does not make sense to have dog stuff sitting around and not use it when we have a dog. Rusty already has a bowl and blankets of his own.\n\nAnd as I was writing this, she came in to tell me that I'm being defiant because I didn't put Caesar's bowl back down for Rusty, as well as that neither my sister or I \"run nothing\" here. Also that we're being illogical and she doesn't have to do anything, that she's thinking of Rusty, not ignoring my sister and I's thoughts and feelings, but that I can put the stuff back if I want just not expect any help in taking care of him.\n\nIdt I'm the asshole for wanting my mom to consult with the rest of the family first but maybe maybe I'm wrong, AITA for bringing another dog home in the first place?\n\n",

I don't think that he's ever simply asked if he can come over, just assumes that he can come over mid-day any day he pleases.\n\nThe five minute text is the result of some conversations my wife had with him to explain that it's difficult for us to plan our day if we don't know that he's coming over far enough in advance. He frequently brushes this off and mentions that we don't have to entertain him like he's our guest and he can just stay in another room while we do what he needs to around the house. \n\nTo me, it's a common courtesy to respect the privacy of others and their personal space by asking if they can come by. To my wife, family members coming and going from other family members' homes unannounced is somewhat acceptable behavior.\n\nI'm really fed up with it. There's times when I just don't feel comfortable in my own home because I can't do what I want when I want. My wife thinks I'm not being very accommodating. She had the conversation with her father partially because she's tired of me complaining about his behavior.\n\nWhile I understand that there's moments when an unannounced visit is acceptable and that there's different generational expectations for this type of thing I really think it's bullshit that even after being asked to, at minimum, let us know he's coming by in advance, he still doesn't and then will stay for two hours.\n\nEDIT #1: He has a key to the home. He's not the only one that has one but is the only one who does this of those that have it.\n\nEDIT #2: My wife and I have lived together for 12 years with the last seven being in a home that we own together as a married couple.",

After me is another sister who is staying at my parents with *her* pair of wild boys. After that is the rest of my 6 brothers. One of which is getting married in a few days.\n\nThis is necessary information because in our family, the girls are treated like royalty. Growing up as the oldest boy in the family, I had a lot of responsibility on my shoulders and now that we are older, my parents and siblings all have grown to rely on me and my wife for a lot.\n\nMy wife even noted that my mom treats her more like a daughter than she does to my sisters in the sense that they are treated as princesses and don't know how to do anything. I absolutely can't stand it and do not let it slide when I'm there but they just ask me instead anyway.\n\nMy sisters don't really parent their own sons very well. Especially now that theyre here with \"free babysitters\" as they call it. They even joke that they're here to be \"daughter's, not mom's\". Thankfully, the one that is staying with me has the more older and better behaved kids but my other sister... they are the most ill mannered kids I've ever seen. \n\nTwo nights ago, my sister was having a hard night with her 5 month old and slept in the morning. Which was fine. My wife got the rest of the kids settled for breakfast while I slept in because I had only gotten back hours before from my night shift.\n\nMy wife put on a cartoon and left for work. I was woken up by the 5 year old screaming \"I pooped! Mooom! I'm pooping!! Mommy, I did a poop!\" I waited for 10 minutes before getting up and telling my sister *who was awake on her phone not sleeping*. She just grunted and was like \"can you wipe his butt?\" \n\nI blinked at her. 1st of all, I believe a 5 year old should be capable of wiping his own butt... but 2nd I AM NOT WIPING YOUR CHILDS BUTT. So I just said \"hell no\" and went back to bed. \n\nMy mom and sisters are pissed with me now. My mom told me that I need to be more nicer to my sister and that she needs help. My sister said I'm being an asshole.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "At 17, we moved to the West coast. I was obviously dejected and horrified because my entire life was on the east coast. However, I thought once I graduated highschool I would just apply to the colleges I actually wanted to go to (Howard, CAU, Spellman) and could find my way back home. \n\nExcept my mother basically refused to fill out the FASFA if I didn't apply exclusively to schools near the state she moved us to. Which would have ruined my life, given that we had a negative 1500 SAI, she had six dependents, food stamps, section 8. Looking at us, you wouldn't know a day in your life we were poor, but inside the house my mother was literally using my checks from my first minimum wage jobs to contribute to utilities and food. the only reason we were even still able to live in that house is because my payout from my first job shutting down was able to cover the rent  payment we almost got evicted for. \n\nI fell in love with a school in Texas and she filled out fasfa.  That kind of dependency on someone else drove me insane. I am hyper independent, and I've known my entire life that needing other people in any genuine capacity is unsafe. The whole fasfa game killed me. \n\nMy mother is abusive, my father is her enabler, so when push finally came to shove, I moved out the day after I graduated. I moved back to the East coast. I'm dating the boyfriend I left behind last time, I'm living with my best friend and her family I've known since sixth grade, my friend group is the strongest it's ever been. \n\nThe other school I got into is in Philadelphia which I originally didn't apply to, but they kept extending and extending and it felt like a sign. I applied secretly and now that I'm back here, in Maryland, it's only an hour away. They're still taking housing deposits, enrollments, ect. I basically have to give them 450 dollars to commit and get housing. They're giving me so much aid,  I'm closer to my hand crafted family, and I just get a clean slate. \n\n My boyfriend is offering to pay the enrollment if it means I'll go to the Philadelphia school but I'm  refusing to take the money from him. Not because I think he’s trying to trap me or I’m ungrateful. But because this is the dependency I KNOW is unsafe because it's consistently always been UNSAFE. Needing people has historically been bad for me. If he needed it,I swear I'd find a way to get it for him a hundred times. I don't care about GIVING money because obviously I know what it's like to not have it. It's the fact of him being my only option AND it being 500$.\n\nI'm probably going to get a waiver, but if I don't then I'm adamant I'm going to the Texas school where I already got set up with housing, orientation, ect",
