      "scenario_description": "So me and my friend have been talking about moving in together for a while now, a couple months shy of a year. He and I live in different cities about 30 mins away from each other. We both don’t like each other’s cities. So we started looking for apartments in the middle of us. The problem is we both have dogs and hers is a pit so we were struggling finding a place. We found one place that seemed meh but acceptable and it was half way in between us.\n\nWell then she started talking about buying a house. More freedom and we don’t have to deal with a landlord. I had just lost my job and she was like perfect you can just get a job in my town and I was like eh id rather not since my whole life (family, partner and friends) are in my town I’d still like to find a place half way. \n\nWell then I got a job in my town that I love. But she has TWO jobs in her town and her family is there so she said she was gonna look in her town in the past that’s closest to me.  Then one day she’s like “JUST PUT IN AN OFFER ON A HOUSE LOL” and I’m like oh wow bold play. The house was 35 mins from my town and 45 mins away from my job. She got the house and I’m dragging my feet bc I don’t want to make that move and be that far from everything that I love but like she also did buy a house..which will probably make things easier for us?  But the rent is going to be more expensive than I pay now, the space is smaller and I hate her decor style lol. \n\n\nBut now she’s being passive aggressive because I’m dragging my feet and I’m torn bc she like bought a house “for us” but every about it feels like a negative for me. So AITA for not being appreciative that she got a house?",

Then she should never have bought a house on the *expectation* (not merely the *hope*) that you would become her housemate and pay rent to her.\n\n At the very least, if your taking up residence there was so important to her, she should have ensured that you liked both the house and the location before she put in an offer. She should not have just sprung the purchase on you as a done deal and expected you to be happy with a place that she chose and you had no say in.\n\nBuying a house is a major financial decision, and must stand on its own, without any reliance on what a person who isn't a partner might or might not do. Your friend sounds impulsive, reckless, and more than a little manipulative.\n\nIf she wants a housemate, she can advertise for one.\n\nNTA.",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for asking my brother to close the windows while you can see your breath inside\n\nMy wife and I (36, 38) go every Friday night to my brother's(33) apartment for dinner. We are very close, we usually cook, sometimes try new recipes, watch old movies, and catch up on the week. We do it at his house because he has a huge TV, fast internet, and sometimes we play PS5 to make fun of how horrible my wife is at RPGs. It's a weekly thing, and has been for a few years. There's an ongoing conflict that gets brought up occasionally, and we haven't resolved it, so I thought I'd ask Reddit for advice. He likes to keep his place very cold. It's his house, he pays the bills, and has every right to do what he wants. While I agree with this, it's extreme. We live in Texas; summer is hot, and winter is cold....to us. He keeps his thermostat at around 65°F in the summer. It's freezing. I work outside; he works in an office.  I usually just get a blanket and deal with it, and my wife bundles up because she hates the cold. Sometimes I joke about his electricity bill, nothing major, but last winter it got cold here, in the teens. He never once turned his heater on; he usually has his windows open through all of this. At one point, when it was in the 30s or 40s outside, his windows were open, and the temperature in his apartment was in the 40s, inside his house! When we got over there, I asked if he was kidding, that it was way too cold. This went on a few times; we cut those nights short and left because it was just too cold. I asked if he could close the windows or something because I feel like if you can see your own breath inside your house, you have a working heater, Money isn't the reason you don't turn it on, and being in a jacket, under covers with a fan on, that's ridiculous. He said this is how he likes it, and instead of closing the windows, he said if we didn't like it, we could leave. We haven't had a regular dinner night over there in a while now, and when we bring it up, it turns into a fight. He wouldnt do this with our parents, or if anyone else was to visit him, he would make sure they are comfortable.. Normally I wouldn't go to someone's house and ask them to change their thermostat. He feels justified and won't apologize for what I feel was inconsiderate and childish behavior.  What do you think? All I really want is an apology,  I guess.",

I'd be hideously embarrassed if I invited someone over and they told me sorry, they find it too uncomfortable for a reason that is well within my control (too hot, too cold, too dusty, too much pet hair, or whatever).\n\nIf I really want that person's company for the evening, I'll take steps to make my home as comfortable as possible for them. I won't turn my house upside down to host someone I'm indifferent to, but if I really like the person and value our relationship, I'll go to considerable lengths to make them feel at home. That includes tolerating something that isn't my ideal temperature for a few hours. I'm surprised that he won't.\n\nBut you were also TA for the following reasons:\n\n1. You are *expecting* him (not merely *asking* him) to set the temperature to a level that suits you and your wife. You can certainly make clear your discomfort, ask him to increase the temperature, take with you an Oodie or similar snuggly warm covering, and so on. That in itself wouldn't make you the asshole. But *expecting* him to turn up the heating takes the issue to a whole 'nother level.\n2. You said \"*when we bring it up, it turns into a fight.*\" You haven't told us exactly what you say whenever you bring it up, or what he says, but the clue may be in \"*what I feel was inconsiderate and childish behavior*.\" I suspect that whenever you talk to each other, you re-litigate the issue, saying the same things over and over about how childish he is, ending on the same stubborn note with neither of you willing to give an inch. Tell me honestly: is he the only one being childish here?\n3. Expecting an apology when he wouldn't give in.\n\nBottom line: it's his house. He keeps it at a temperature that he likes, and you can't control what he does. You can only control what you do.\n\n*We haven't had a regular dinner night over there in a while now,*\n\nAnd you may need to keep it that way, unless you want to host these dinners at your house instead.\n\nIf he really wants you back, he'll turn the heating up. If he doesn't, he won't. He'll need to decide what he prefers to tolerate: a temperature that's too warm for his liking, or being alone.",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 31F and my mom (Brenda, 55F) and I are honestly pretty close. But there’s this one thing she does that’s been getting under my skin for years. Basically, if I tell her anything about my life, she’ll go and talk about it with the whole extended family. Like... everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins, even random relatives I barely know or haven’t seen in forever. Nothing’s too small—she’ll mention stuff about who I’m seeing, stuff with my job, health stuff, money stuff... just everything.\n\nI’ve told her to stop doing that so many times. Like I’ll say “hey, I don’t want anyone else knowing about this,” and she’ll nod like she gets it—but then later I hear she’s been talking. And when I call her out, she always says something like, “Oh, come on, it’s just family!” or “I wasn’t gossiping, I was just chatting.” Like??? That doesn’t really make it better.\n\nAnyway, not long ago I had this minor medical thing done—nothing serious, but definitely personal. I told her ahead of time, super clearly, that I didn’t want anyone else knowing. Just wanted to keep it to myself.\n\nThen like three days later, I start getting these “how are you feeling??” texts from a bunch of my aunts. And yep—turns out my mom told them. Again.\n\nI was honestly so frustrated. I called her and told her straight up that I felt like she didn’t respect my privacy, and that I was hurt she went and told people again after I asked her not to. I told her I need her to stop sharing my life like that—it’s not just casual chatting when it’s stuff I asked her to keep private.\n\nShe got really upset. Said I was attacking her, said I was overreacting and being cold, and now she won’t talk to me. My dad says I should’ve handled it “more gently” and that I made her feel bad. So now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far.\n\nWas I the asshole for putting my foot down?",

I'll repeat here what I said to them:\n\nOP, I have a close family member who is now over 80, and has been like that for their entire life.\n\nEverything I tell them, they tell everyone.\n\nI know they're still doing this because often they will tell ME deeply personal and potentially embarrassing things about other people.\n\nMe, on the phone: \"You shouldn't be telling me this about Cousin Cheryl. I'm very sure this is something she would want kept private until she's ready to talk about it - and that may be never.\"\n\nThem: \"Oh, stop worrying. I know you won't tell anyone. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. And THEN Cheryl did blah blah blah...\"\n\nMe: \"Stop. Stop talking about this. If you don't stop, I'm going to hang up.\"\n\nI have tried and tried and TRIED to get them to keep some things about me private. Nothing has worked. They will never stop.\n\nThere is only one way to deal with a person like that. **Never tell them anything you don't want the whole town to know.**\n\nI'm pretty sure it has dawned on them that I'm no longer sharing quite a lot of information with them. I'm guessing they're hurt by it. I can't help that. It's a necessary self-preservation measure.",

      "scenario_description": "I, [18F] like to cook and bake for my family from time to time, and put lots of pride and effort into what I create. I'll make cake pops, Mediterranean chicken and rice, etc. I always try my best, and love to work hard on recipes. What I don't like however, is my father constantly handing food to the dog. He's not sneaking off bad food to her, or asking for a sit before hand. She begs, and gets what she wants. This has started to bother me, since now whenever I try to hand any food item to my dad, the dog is up in his and my face, trying to lick the plate and eat the food, as she feels entitled to it. She also has learned that begging works, so she's drooling everywhere, not listening to anyone who tells her to stop begging. My dad has taught her that begging works, and that she will always get a piece of my hard work. Any food I hand him whether the dog behaves or not, will also be consumed by the dog. This hurts, I want PEOPLE to enjoy my cooking, not a dog that's only wanting the food to consume. I've considered not cooking or baking anymore, as I don't want to see my food gone to somthing that won't appreciate it, and I also don't want to feed into the poor training of our dog. I've tried to tell my dad I don't like it when he feeds the dog my food, and I'd prefer he atleast train her manners before giving her anything. That's the other thing. My dad used to be a dog trainer, he knows how to handle the dog, and stop her from stealing food, but he doesn't do anything. He gets defensive that he's just giving her \"a bit.\" So. WIBTA if I say he can't enjoy any of my cooking if portions go to the dog?",

Obesity shortens pets' lives.\n\nDo you think your dad would stop doing this if you tell him that he's risking a whole bunch of health problems for your dog? In particular, if your cooking is anything like mine, there's a member of the onion family in practically every savory dish. No way would I risk giving it to a dog.",

      "scenario_description": "My mom (F49) and I (M19) got into an argument yesterday. I am usually supposed to pick up my younger sister from school, because my mom goes to work, and since my college finishes early, it's just more convenient that way. Back when I was still in school, she used to pick us up everyday and had no problem taking off some time from work.\n\nOver the summer, I have been writing a research paper at my university which is a great opportunity for me especially since I'm passionate about pursuing a career in academia. Next week, on Monday there is an academic conference at my university where my supervisor will be presenting my work. It's safe to say that this is a huge moment for me and I would very much like to attend it.\n\nHowever, when I told my mom about it she didn't seem interested at all, she barely even heard what I had to say. She did however, tell me that I have to pick up my sister no matter what. I requested her to make an exception however, she wasn't willing to listen. I told her how important it was to me but she said that these things will come and go on in life and that I needed to fulfill my responsibilities.\n\nI calmly made some arguments to convince her but things heated up and she called me some slurs, After some time of a constant barrage of slurs I snapped and called her a slut. She got really angry at me after that, and flew into a fit of rage. Honestly, it's a bit of a blur what she was saying but after a few hours things calmed down a bit.\n\nSo here's the thing, when I called her a slut I didn't mean that. We are Indian and in our country, linguistic diversity is a huge thing so when we moved states when I was very young, my mom was the only one I learnt our language from. Apart from some relatives and my sister that's all the people I have ever spoken to in this language. It's just that I've heard my mom use that phrase a lot and I thought it meant asshole because she was supposedly using it in those contexts.\n\nAfter things had calmed down I explained this to her, saying what my intentions truly were. However, this made her even more angry. She started saying that I was putting the blame on her and that she never uses that word ever. She said that I was becoming a misogynist and that no matter my intentions I still referred to her as a slut and that's fully my fault. She was no longer willing to listen to logic or reason after that.\n\nSo am I the asshole for calling my slut? Or if not does calling her an asshole still make me one? I'm really confused the way she acted and refused to listen to any reasoning.",

It's a 6hr drive but because I don't drive, I will be taking public transport.\n\nI'm currently on summer break from university, and have been sitting at home with nothing to do. The summer break started in early May and will end in mid September. The furthest I've been since the summer break began is the mall about 5 miles from my house, which I went to with my younger sister. \n\nI want to go on this vacation with my younger sister, who is also on summer break. I would pay for her, and the whole vacation will last 5 days. \n\nI decided I want to go because everyone else is going abroad, I've been rejected from over 50+ jobs, and I've been disrespected by my younger brothers who swore at me and cursed at me things that I cannot repeat here while my father was at work. When my father came home and I told him my brothers said these things to me, my father did nothing. \n\nI am so exhausted. I help my father manage his business, I help my mother, I have been a good daughter. I just want a break from this life for 5 days. I have no strength to carry on with life in this household and I need a reset. \n\nI told my parents that I would take the train, I would stay in one hotel, I would visit the beach and have ice cream and drink coffee, and not stay out past 9pm, and that I would keep my location open for them to see. \n\nWhen I told my dad my plans, he did not take me seriously. At first he was just saying \"yes, yes, of course, go ahead, do whatever you want\" and then later he told me to not be silly, and to shut up, amongst other things. Of course I was upset, so I left it and came back the next day and said \"let's talk seriously, if I make it four days (because 2 days will be gone from the travelling) will you allow me to go with my sister?\"\n\nHe told me to go ask my mother and that for him it is a no. When I asked my mother she told me I cannot go without my father's permission. \n\nI need a break. I cannot go on like this. If I book this trip and go, will I be wrong for disobeying my parents? Even though the trip will have no effect on them as I will still do all the business admin work and I will pay for the whole trip? ",

      "scenario_description": "Last December, two classmates and I moved into a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom house. I share a bathroom with one of them. Early on, I noticed my housemate often didn’t flush the toilet at night. When I brought it up, he said it was to save water and not wake me. I explained the water bill wasn’t high and flushing wouldn’t wake me, but he suggested I just pee on top of it. I realized we had a cultural difference and let it go.\n\nNext, the walls are thin and my room is behind the kitchen. My roommates would use the blender, play loud music, and yell, while I had to be extremely quiet at night because one roommate’s room is a den with no door, and the other claims to have hyperacusis (very sensitive hearing). I adjusted my schedule, avoided showering or making noise at night, used my phone flashlight, and refrained from calls or cooking late, but still got complaints.\n\nFor six months, I basically only went home to shower, sleep, and meal prep, spending the rest of my time on campus because I felt uncomfortable at the apartment. Despite barely being there, I paid my share of all the bills.\n\nRecently, I had to travel home for a surgical evaluation and then surgery, missing over two weeks at the apartment. When the bills came, I suggested to my roommates that since I hadn’t been there for more than half the month, I should only pay half of the water and gas bills (since I didn’t use them), but still cover my full share of electricity and wifi, since my stuff was in the fridge.\n\nOne roommate responded harshly, saying she didn’t understand why my absence should affect her finances, that we’re adults, and if I had a problem, maybe I shouldn’t have moved in. She accused me of asking her to pay my bills and told me to just say how much money I wanted.\n\nI clarified that I wasn’t contesting previous bills or asking for payment, just proposing we fairly split the next month’s gas and water since I wasn’t there. She replied that there was “nothing mature” about my request.\n\nSo, here’s my question: Am I the asshole for suggesting my share of the water and gas bills be reduced for the period I was away?\n\nFor context, I was only asking to pay half for water and gas, not to avoid paying entirely.",

      "comment_text": "You are NTA for asking.\n\nI disagree with your roommate that there is \"nothing mature\" about your request. Personally, I think it was reasonable, and if I were one of your roommates, I'd say \"Yep, that's fair. Let's do that.\" I would do that because one day I might be the roommate who needs to be away for two weeks having surgery, and I might need you to extend the same consideration to me.\n\nBut it doesn't make your situation any less awkward.\n\nYou said in your opening line that these people are classmates. Your story demonstrates the potential hazards of moving in with friends, acquaintances, or family members you didn't grow up living with, such as cousins or in-laws. Even if you've always gotten along well enough in the past when visiting each other or sharing a classroom or workplace, living together is different. It can throw up differences of opinion and tensions and irritations, and tiny things can grow into major sources of conflict. Living together can ruin even the best of friendships. If you find someone you get on well with as a friend or classmate or workmate, AND they're also someone you're comfortable living with, you're very lucky.\n\nYou can't force your roommates to accept your proposal, so you may just have to suck it up for now.\n\nHaving said that, this incident, plus the other ones you described about the noise levels, means I'd be working on looking for somewhere else to live, with roommates you may find more compatible and fair.\n\nAnd before you do move in with someone else, sit down and have a discussion with them about this particular \"What if...?\" and any other what-ifs you can think of. What if one of you is away for a week or more? What if someone wants to have their parents from out of town stay for a week? What if one of you wants a pet? What if one of you has a boyfriend or girlfriend who sleeps over more than once a week and is eating all the cereal and taking 30-minute showers? And so on.\n\nIf you do move out, and these people continue to be your classmates, I'd be treating them with chilly politeness. If they insist on re-litigating the roommate issues even after you've gone, I'd just say mildly, \"I've moved on from all that. How about you do the same?\"",

She (34F) knows this. She recently got pregnant, and as you know pregnant women should limit their intereaction with litter. We get along fairly well I would say. She and her bf (lives 40mins away) lightheartedly said that \"It's your (my) responsibility to clean the kitty litter now\". We live a block away from each other and I am excited about the baby and want to help and provide support as best as I can, just not with that. I feel like a shitty sister, but I also don't want to do it. AITA?\n\nUpdate -\nWow! I did not expect this many responses. Thank you everyone. To answer similar questions in the thread:\n1. This is a fairly new relationship (between sis and her bf). Despite that they did plan to get pregnant. I don't ask many questions regarding that - to each their own. \n2. I do not know their plans to cohabitate, for now, as far as I know, they will continue to live 40 mins apart. Though this question isn't about them.\n3. My sister moved a block away from me a year ago to be closer to me, and likes the area, which I've lived in for 5 years.\n4. The BF is not a terrible guy, he is very much involved and an intentional participant in this whole process, which makes their comment of me taking care of the kitty litter even more confusing. With his work schedule, he visits/stays over 1-3 per week, that I know of. \n5. Yes, their comment was light-hearted, in the way that you add an \"lol\" to a rather risky thing to say. \n6.

      "scenario_description": "So a little context before I get into this, back in November I (20 M) was unemployed for about 2 months and got hired for a new job at the end of December. During this time I would get on my PlayStation and play with two of my close friends (both 21 M) from 10pm-11pm. At this time my girlfriend I live with was working closing shifts and coming home around 11pm or midnight so this is how I would wait up for her. \n\nThe first couple months of working I would still get on games with them when I wasn’t busy. I was working mornings at the same place as my girlfriend. Eventually she started working mornings but was scheduled a little earlier than me. Since we work at the same place we carpool and I started to wake up earlier than normal so that I could go with her. I start at 7am but she’ll start at 6 or 5am so usually I get up at 5 or 4am depending on the shift. My mental health got pretty bad a couple months ago and I started to fall asleep earlier because I was so tired all the time. It’s helped a lot I get around 7 hours of sleep if I fall asleep by 10pm and I’ve seen a difference in how I feel overall. \n\nI communicated with my two friends about how on work nights I couldn’t get on if it was at 10pm and id like still get on around 9pm instead if they wanna play games during the week. They’re both employed so I thought maybe they’d get it. Unfortunately both of them never made any changes to when they get on. I’d ask to get on earlier and they’d say not until 10 so I simply wouldn’t get on. I would inform them of my schedule and when I had off days and they’d still blow up my phone and call me on work nights around 10-10:30pm. At first I didn’t care too much because it was whatever but after a while it was annoying repeatedly telling them I have work so I can’t get on and then they still blow up my phone.\n\nThe real problems have happened in the past month or so. One time I did not answer the phone at 9:45, I didn’t think anything of it but then one of the friends started to call and text my girlfriend telling her to tell me to get on. I naturally was pissed and told him to not bother my girlfriend when I’ve already told him I have work so I can’t get on. Then after that every time I’ve said I cannot get on due to work they just make fun of me or get upset with me. They think it’s a funny joke and at first it didn’t bug me but now it’s ridiculous. Every time I talk to them even about normal things they get on me about not staying up until 11 or 12pm. \n\nI’ve communicated and talked to them bluntly about how I feel about things. I’ve tried to be understanding but I feel I’m at my wits end with this. I don’t want to drop them because they’re really good friends to me and I love playing with them but I feel they don’t understand the importance of sleep to me and how much it helps me. \n\nEdit: Thank you guys so much for this response. I will say I do put my phone on so not disturb but I have it set to let phone calls through including theirs because one of the friends has called me in the middle of the night a couple times with some very concerning stuff. I worry that’ll happen again and what’ll happen if I don’t answer that call. I appreciate everyone’s advice tho ! ",

      "scenario_description": "My mother-in-law watches our baby once a week and brings her chihuahua with her when she comes. The past couple of months I’ve been figuring out that her dog has been peeing on our carpet and also peeing on one of our baby’s play mats. I’ve just been putting up with it and washing the mat in the washing machine after each visit. Tonight I decided to take the blue light to our carpet and noticed pee stains in multiple places throughout our home.\n\nThis morning before I left her work I saw her show him his puppy pee pad and say “you go potty HERE”.\n\nI am nervous to say anything to her because she is a good person, but she is VERY easily offended and I really need her to continue watching our baby. My husband also isn’t happy that the dog is peeing, but he has not said anything to his mother. Am I wrong to think that it be his place to say something? Am I blowing this out of proportion?",

      "comment_text": "NTA.\n\nI'm gobsmacked that your MIL has been letting this happen for several weeks and hasn't said a word to you about it.\n\nIf I brought an animal or a small human into someone's home and it peed somewhere - or, heaven forbid, I had a similar accident myself (it happens as you get older) - I'd be utterly mortified. I'd get out the stain remover and fabric deodorizer, I'd scrub and scrub, I'd apologize profusely, I'd take steps to prevent it happening again. She is letting the dog pee on your carpet, making no effort to clean it, and thinking a bit of finger-wagging at the dog will fix the problem?\n\nPeople never cease to amaze me.\n\nYes, ideally your husband should be the one to address this issue with his mother.\n\nNot because it would be wrong for you to do so - it wouldn't be - but because parents-in-law tend to make allowances for their own son or daughter while casting their son's or daughter's spouse as the bad guy. So a good rule of thumb when in-law problems arise is \"I deal with my family, you deal with yours\". Don't let anyone force you to be the bad guy when your husband is no happier with the situation than you are.\n\nThis is especially true given that she is easily offended. Your husband has had a lifetime's experience in knowing what to say to her that will cause her to take the least offense, and you haven't.\n\nThat's not to say she still won't get offended. She probably will. But unless he's totally tactless and/or clueless, he is your best shot at resolving it without more hurt feelings than absolutely necessary.\n\n*I really need her to continue watching our baby.*\n\nYou really can't pay for a different sitter, or for daycare? Could she leave the dog at home? Could the dog wear a doggy diaper while it's in your house?\n\nUPDATE: When I said \"let your husband deal with his mother\", I forgot to add \"...and don't let HIM cast you as the bad guy either!\" I hope your husband would never dream of such a thing, but I had an ex who used to do just that. If we'd been dealing with your situation and my ex had to confront his mother, the conversation would have gone something like this: \"Honestly, Mom, I'm perfectly OK with it. Poor little Pablo can't help peeing on the carpet. When you gotta go, you gotta go, right? But you know how houseproud ThisWillAgeWell is. She goes nuts if everything isn't spotless. Every time Pablo has an accident, I never hear the end of it from her. I really don't need her giving me any more grief about it. I already have enough to deal with. So could you please do me a huge favor and leave Pablo at home?\"\n\nIf you have a gut feeling that your husband might do this, it would be better to tackle your MIL yourself. That's one exception to the \"I deal with my family, you deal with yours\" rule. If you're going to end up the bad guy no matter what, it may as well be on your terms.",

      "scenario_description": "Hello. I (28F) have been with my partner (30M) for quite some time now. I have a daughter with my previous partner and she's 5 yo now. Let's call her Mina. And I have twins (1M) with my current partner. A little background. Ever since I live with my current partner, I help around the house. Since, we're both looking for a decent job, we don't have much for food so we eat on the main house where we're living right now. My partner's niece (7F) come to the main house as usual and I always, take note: always, help my partner's niece to get her food, give her water. I'm really not complaining about it. I love serving the people that I love. My partner's parents went home from abroad and we (as in all of the family members) went for a trip outside our town and we ate at a local restaurant where we rode a boat and cruised through the river. The food was already served and we just needed to help ourselves to get some food for our plates. One time. Just this one time. They got the baby from me for me to do the things that needed to be done like get food and drinks for my daughter. After that, I went in and get my baby. My partner's mom was furious because I didn't get food for my partner's niece. Like the niece's parents was just there grabbing their own food not knowing that their own daughter is just waiting for her food to be served. And now may partner's mom is blaming me because I prioritized my daughter over her granddaughter. So, Am I the asshole for prioritizing my daughter over my partner's niece?",

(Whether you have fetched food for her in the past is irrelevant.)\n\nFirstly, the child is 7, which is plenty old enough to start learning how to take food from a communal serving dish and putting it on her plate.\n\nSecondly, even if her parents deem her not yet old enough or responsible enough to do it herself without being unhygienic and/or making a mess all over the table, it still doesn't explain why they expected YOU to do it.\n\nWhy couldn't the child's parents do it?\n\nWhy couldn't your partner's mom do it?\n\nWhy couldn't your partner do it?\n\nALL of the above people have a closer connection to the child than you do.\n\nEven if someone was holding your twins at the time and didn't have their hands free, that's still only two babies between four people.\n\nThere's some weird dynamic going on in this family, and I suspect a degree of sexism and/or classism on their part (e.g. they've gotten into the habit of treating you as the maid). It's difficult to tell because your post is a little vague on certain points.\n\nIn the absence of further information, I'll say NTA for now.",

He says it doesn't bother him, but when it actually happens he never actually looks like he finds it as funny as everyone else. \n\nPlaying video games? If he makes any mistake its always \"you fucking idiot/dumbass\" or \"you're shit.\" If he says anything about our kids, it always good thing they didn't get you nappy hair/big forehead/big nose/dry skin. Anything relating to appearance? Basically the same thing as listed before. \n\nLast weeken my husband had some people over, and I don't know the context but they were calling him some variance of the beginning of the 3rd paragraph. I said \"that's not funny\" and one of them kind of gave me that \"Wtf\" look. I then said I didn't like that that he always had to be the target of every joke and said they should probably stop. \n\nMy husband wasn't happy with me after that, and said that it didn't matter and he \"didn't ask me to do that.\" \n\nAITA?

Does he realize he's the target of just about every joke? Does he think that's fair? Does he perceive the racist undertones of some of their remarks? How did it make him feel when you said \"That's not funny\"? Has he ever considered sticking up for himself? Would he ever? Is he worried that the insults will get worse if he does? Is there any one of his friends who is not joining in the name-calling, that he would prefer to stick up for him, rather than you? Has he considered widening his friendship circle to include people who aren't going to call him names or make fun of him?\n\nEven if he won't directly give *you* answers to any of these questions, I think you should ask them anyway. Hopefully he will think about them, and answer them in his own mind, even if he's unwilling to answer them aloud. You can certainly tell him that you love and respect him, it hurts you to see his friends constantly put him down, and he deserves to be treated better than that.\n\nIf none of this does any good - if he won't talk about it, won't listen when you try to talk to him, and is still annoyed with you - then all I can suggest is that you absent yourself whenever his friends visit.

My sister has an upcoming conference for an internship in DC and asked to stay at my apartment. I told my sister that she is more than welcome to stay with me, but she first needs to admit to lying and apologize. She is refusing to do what I asked, so I have informed her that she will need to get a hotel room.

      "scenario_description": "My mum has always been strict and traditional and is very uptight about who I associate with. I am a 16 years old girl who goes to an all girls' school so all my friends are girls. I do know of some boys through mutuals but that's it. \n\nFor some background information, a few years ago I thought I had a crush on another girl, but as I grew up and looked back, I think it was just admiration and not an actual romantic crush. Fast forward to this year, a girl, whom I am friends with and loved as a friend, confessed to me. We didn't end up dating and even months later now I am still not sure if my feelings towards her did evolve into romantic. I had never dated before so I don't have a reference to compare my feelings to.\n\nI always knew my mum was judgy about anything that she considers as \"deviant\" and my dad would always blindly agree with whatever my mum thinks. Also, I never felt that they loved me as they are just authoritarian so I wanted to see if their love would transcend their hate. \n\nI told my parents about the girl and about how much she meant to me and how I didn't want to lose something beautiful. They called it weird and told me they wouldn't recommend. My mum got super defensive and gave me the silent treatment for days. I had a planned hang out with my friend and she became suspicious and pretty much implied that I was trying to sneak out to see my secret girlfriend. \n\nI might turn out to be straight I really don't know yet but I am an ally and I would like argue with my mum about like how its NOT abnormal to be in a same sex relationship. Now I might be petty for this: I would deliberately check my phone more, even when there is nothing to check, just to give my mum the wrong impression. I would also say things like I don't care what the boys think and that I'm not boy crazy. My mum barged in and I was doing my work but accidentally clicked a button which unpaused a Youtube video in the background and she thought I was calling someone. AITA? ",

Maybe you are, maybe you're not, maybe you're bisexual. Sixteen is a confusing time and it may take you many years to work out who you really are and what sort of person you're attracted to. It took many years for me to work it out. You're still young and you have plenty of time. I wouldn't be too worried about pinning a label on yourself at this stage.\n\nBut you're deliberately baiting your parents by dropping hints that you're a lesbian. That's an asshole move. You can be a good ally to the LGBTQI+ community without taunting your parents.\n\nI'm not saying it's always an asshole move to lie about one's sexuality. Not at all. My number one rule is whatever you do, BE SAFE. If you're in a homophobic and hostile environment (home, community, state, country) and you fear for your safety, damn right you can pretend to be straight. And vice versa: if a guy is giving you unwanted attention and your instinct tells you that rejecting him will make him very angry, by all means pretend to be a lesbian. I would never judge a person for telling whatever lie they need to tell about their sexuality in order to keep themselves safe.\n\nBut you give no indication that you feel unsafe in your home. You're just trying to provoke a reaction. That's not a mature way to win your parents over to your cause. Drop the baiting. If you genuinely want to change their minds, be mature about it.",

      "scenario_description": "I invited SIL(30) over to play pool and have a couple drinks. She’s been over before, occasionally. A couple times a year. We’d been hanging out for hours. She had criticized a few small things earlier in the evening, which I thought was a little odd, but Ok. Later in the evening, she started in on me. She wanted to know why there are still cardboard boxes in the basement since we had moved last summer (9 months ago at that point). She said it was a mess and r here’s stuff everywhere. I stopped listening so honestly I couldn’t tell you. I stopped her and pointed at my partner. I said “he will tell you, with all honesty right now that he hasn’t washed a dish, scooped the cat box, cleaned a toilet or done anything close to it since I moved in” and he agreed with me. And her response was “well our dad never did any of that”…. Like it was a perfectly reasonable explanation. To digress: in a later conversation, his response was also that in his house growing up, the “breadwinner” didn’t clean. I hate that phrase now. I explained that I also work full time (I make less than he does), I am fully responsible for the kids (they are mine biologically, his step kids for all I’s and P’s), I do the cooking, all shopping and running errands. And my amount of time spent at home is the same as his, if not LESS. He agreed, he is not the ONLY “breadwinner”. \nHe also does not usually mention when the house is out of order and still doesn’t lift a finger. \nBack to his sister…. This was almost 3 months ago. He went no contact with sister for confronting me about the house being messy (again, 3 kids under the age of 7 and both of us work full time; only I clean when time is available…. I’m doing my best here people)…. Well, the other day his sister called him and apparently they had a happy old chat. Apparently **** eye roll **** he told her why I’m upset (she already knew) and he asked if she would reach out to me and talk about it. She asked if maybe she should apologize and he said that might help. His stance is; that’s the end of it. It’s up to her, and no matter what, it’s his family and I need to let it go. My stance is, she stood on my own front porch and insulted me. When she could have said maybe that she sees it’s a struggle when I have a lot going on; and maybe I could use a hand. Or simply keep her mouth shut and appreciate an invitation to spend time with family. I don’t automatically forgive her. I don’t think it’s ok to brush under the rug because she’s his family. She was hateful and judgmental when I invited her into our home. Am I really the AH here??",

      "comment_text": "NTA.\n\n*no matter what, it’s his family and I need to let it go.*\n\nYour partner is wrong. **In-laws do not have carte blanche to say insulting things and treat you badly.** Your partner had been doing OK up to that point in regard to this particular conflict. (Not for other things, but we'll get to that later.) He supported you in this conflict, he agreed with the points you made, he stopped speaking with his sister.\n\nAnd then he went and undid all that good work by expecting you and his sister to kiss and make up purely because time had passed and \"*it's his family*\" regardless of whether she apologizes or not. No. No no no nononono. If you were right three months ago, you're still right. Time on its own doesn't erase conflicts. His sister can apologize to you if she wants (and it would need to be sincere), but even then, you're not obliged to accept her apology or resume friendly relations with her if you don't want. Forgiveness isn't a transaction. It's not like you insert one apology token and out pops a forgiveness token.\n\nSecond point: **you didn't need to justify yourself to your SIL.** Unless you're living in absolute squalor that is a health hazard, you never need to defend your standards of housekeeping or explain why they don't meet someone else's standards.\n\nThere's a vast range of \"good enough\" when it comes to cleanliness and tidiness. I have a friend whose husband is obsessive about tidiness. Say she's reading a newspaper on the sofa. She'll put it down for a few minutes to make a coffee or go to the bathroom, and come back and discover he has thrown it in the trash because \"it's making the room untidy\". I wouldn't want to live with him. I want to be able to leave a newspaper on the sofa for a few minutes, or a few hours, or even a few days if I want. That to me is not an untidy room.\n\nYour SIL would be horrified if she came to my house. She's shocked by cardboard boxes unopened for 9 months? In the BASEMENT, no less, where your SIL really has no reason to be? Pfffftttt. I have at least one box in the spare room that I don't think I've opened for about 10 years. I can't even remember offhand what's in it.\n\nFinal point, and probably the most important:\n\nYou are currently doing most (all?) of the heavy lifting on the domestic front, and THAT is something you need to be having a conversation with your partner about, away from your SIL. It isn't fair, and your annoyance about the unfairness is beginning to slip out and creep into situations it has nothing to do with, such as the dispute with his sister. You should have been able to shut down the conversation with your SIL purely because she's rude and unreasonable, without blaming anything on your partner.\n\nYou feel resentful that he does so little around the house, and you're perfectly justified in feeling that way. I would be too.\n\nBut it isn't your SIL you should have voiced your resentment to. It's your partner. **He needs to step up and do his fair share.**",
