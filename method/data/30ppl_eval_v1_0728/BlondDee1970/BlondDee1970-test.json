      "post_title": "AITA: A coworker; but a close friend, is upset that I’m not picking up shifts that’s he’s CONSTANTLY asking me to pick up because of emotional and mental hardship.",
      "scenario_description": "I started this new job at a place I used to be a regular at, and eventually became close friends with a few of the workers here. They offered me a job, and of course I couldn’t say no to such offer. It’s a lovely environment and everyone seems to get along very nicely. I wanted to work as much as possible so if a coworker asks of me to cover a shift for them or pick one up, I would without hesitation. A few weeks go by and “Coworker” ; let’s call him Sink, Asks me to cover some shifts because he’s just not doing too well, and of course I say yes. Another week goes by of Sink asking me to cover more shifts or come in early so he can go home. I’ve slowly started to decline picking up his shifts because I started to go out with some old friends. Keep in mind I usually don’t ask other coworkers to pick up my shifts, but I ask my manager for the days I need off when she’s creating schedules. Thursday on the 26th of June, I requested that I needed that day off to attend court and my mother; who I hadn’t seen for a while was returning home from Dallas. I had also been informing Sink and other coworkers I had court THAT day. Thursday hits and after court I decided to rest a little bit before my mom gets home. As I’m falling asleep I hear my phone ringing, but I was genuinely just too tired to reach for my phone that had fallen under my bed. I wake up and I see it’s a missed call from Sink, and of course still being his friend I ask him what’s up. I get a text back from Sink saying “Hey Brother, could we possibly switch shifts? My mental isn’t okay today. If you cants it’s fine. Just wanna be cautious.” I respond “So brotha my mom just got back today and I plan on being with her.” I forgot the “rry”, shame on me for being half asleep. Five hours later I get a text from Sink that just says “Brother…” I text back saying “Wha?” He responds with “ I’m letting you know now… don’t call me to cover.” At first I didn’t think much of it so I kinda just brush it off. The next day I go into some deep thinking over the situation and decide to text my manager to ask if I had done something, and I decided to ask her because I genuinely had no knowledge or idea to what I had said or done. She said to me “ I think he was just upset because he needed his shift covered yesterday and you said no and he feels like every time you call out he’s always the one covering it.” Again, I try not call out but ask off days in advance. I’m not that bothered by the situation as much now, but what do y’all think? Am I being ignorant towards his emotional state, or could he just be reusing an excuse?",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway account, first post, English is not my first language yada yada. For some context, right now I (23m) am at my girlfriends (23f) parents house, as we are watching the dogs for all of July as her parents are on vacation. Me and my gf are going down to my mom's house on Friday and staying until Sunday, and my gf's sister will watch the dogs this weekend.\n\nNow, for the actual contentious parts where I wanna know if I'm the asshole. So, today my mom (44f) sent a text that I need to come down on Tuesday already to help preparing everything. This includes bringing over tables from another house 30 minutes away, buying paper plates, cutlery and mugs, and cleaning my moms house where we will celebrate. For some further context, my mom has bipolar, and is apparently experiencing a particularly tough period right now, which I learned during our interaction but I'll get to that, but this is why she needed the extra help. She also has ADHD. So, right now I am studying some summer distance courses. I have a really hard time with routines and am very reliant on them to function (diagnosed ADHD, possible autism), so having to travel in the middle of the week would put a lot of extra stress on me. Further, it would cost a lot more (maybe $75 instead of $40) as I would be taking the train instead of both me and my gf taking a car (which gf would then have to drive alone for 4 hours which is also unfair for her). I said if mom made me a list, I could take care of everything from where I am and bring it, and then me and gf can work super hard on Friday to put everything together, instead of me traveling down Tuesday. She thought this was in no way possible and absolutely out of the question. I said she will have no responsibility or have to lift a finger, and we will take care of everything, but that was not okay according to her. So we argue back and fourth, I say it's unfair to spring this on me so soon in advance, she says it's because recently her bipolar has gotten worse and she's gonna go to the doctor tomorrow to talk about getting ECT (electro chock therapy) because her bipolar has gotten so bad. We argue back and fourth, I say if it's that bad then we can move the celebration to another place. She says that's not possible because there's no place big enough. We both call each other selfish and unfair and she starts sobbing. While I feel really bad at this point, it feels like nothing other than her plan is acceptable to her, which I feel is unfair. She says that if I wanna try doing the preparation in one day, I can but then she will go away from home for that entire weekend.\n\nLast year I celebrated my birthday in my university city where I live, and that year she also got really upset with me because I was selfish for not celebrating with my family and relatives. It just feels like I can't win no matter what I do (except when I do exactly as she says). There has been more times where she's acted in similar ways.\n\nSo reddit, AITAH?",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nRecently i (18) had a massive fight with my parents because i had talked to my younger sibling (9) about my dad, a historically emotionally abusive parent. My dad had yelled at them harshly and they ran into their room crying so hard they were coughing and gagging. I came in and had a long talk with them. i told them that dad has a “hard time controlling his anger” and that he can be “mean sometimes”. I told them he treated me similarly when i was their age. I just wanted them to know it wasn’t their fault. I also told them that my step mom (their mother, we are technically half siblings but i consider them my sibling) can be afraid to call my dad out to reassure them that she wasn’t in on this behavior. \n\n\n\nComing back to the argument, my parents were yelling at me telling me that i was telling my siblings things they were “too young to understand” and that i was “turning them against [my dad]”. They then told me to “get out” and threatened to call the police if i refused to leave. I ended up having my mom pick me up and I’m at her house now, so to be clear I’m not on the streets or anything. They keep telling me they “did what they had to do” and whatnot. \n\n\n\nAnyways, it’s been a few days since this happened and my step mom sent me a letter saying that I couldn’t come back until I stop talking to my sibling about our parents. Am I the asshole here? ",

I had decided it might make it all the better if I were to invite my Bestfriend and his GF. \n\nI gave them a 3 months heads up. And they both said they had wanted to go. My GF and I booked AirBNBs prior and thought it would be nice to offer them to stay with us as well. Something came up last minute with them and I thought it wasn’t that big of a deal. But 2 weeks before we went My Bestfriends GF had secretly planned a Birthday Trip to Bethany Beach (which is like 30-45 mins from Ocean City) at first I was confused and hurt but then I kinda pushed it aside because well it was his Birthday and maybe this was coincidence? \n\nSo I let it go because he had no idea this was going to happen. So fast forward my GF and I go on the vacation come back and not even a week later I find out He and his GF go to Washington DC. \n\nI confronted him about the timing and location of his trips to ours and explained to him it hurt me he did this when he could have went with us. He apologized if he hurt my feelings and said since it was my first real vacation and it was his 5th one this year an he wanted me to enjoy my first but I mentioned to him so many different times I told him I wanted him to come with us. And he told me he wanted to go too. Just makes me feel like they didn’t want to go in the first place with us. AITA??\n",

And thats ok. Be hurt, but don't be angry. Hopefully that makes sense. So many things can go awry when two couples travel together.

She also complains.. A LOT. She is extremely negative about every single little thing and it ruins my mood at work. If I don't take her side or immediately agree with what she's saying, she gets passive aggressive with me.\n\nI can understand needing someone to talk to, but I'm not sure if I'm the right person for this. Earlier she snapped at me because she needed to clock out for something and rudely insinuated that I didn't think it was important, which isn't the case in the slightest.\n\nI literally just want to show up to work and go home after my shift, not hear about all of this drama and negativity. I feel like I need to tell her that I can't keep listening to her personal problems because I don't know how to help her, but I know she will start being extremely rude to me and potentially tell everyone else that I'm an AH.

      "scenario_description": "I (20F) live in a flat with 3 other girls. We recently moved in, and everything was fine until I mentioned that I’m planning to start tutoring kids (from our building) at home.\n\nMy dad is going through financial problems and can’t send me money right now, so I really need to earn and support myself. I don’t want to be a burden on him. I haven’t started tutoring yet, but I plan to teach around **8–10 kids** between **5 PM and 7 PM**, either in the **hall or my room**, whichever works best. This is a very normal tuition time in India.\n\nThe issue is, one of my flatmates is against it. She says **5–7 PM is her study time**, and she’ll be disturbed by the noise. She also said she needs to **sleep by 10 PM**. However, we all have **college from 8 AM to 4 PM**, so realistically, most of our free time starts after that—and from what I’ve observed, she doesn’t go to sleep at 10 PM anyway.\n\nI even offered to:\n\n* Let her study wherever she feels comfortable during that time\n* Keep the kids in one area with the door closed\n* Manage the noise as much as possible (though the flat isn’t soundproof)\n\nDespite trying to compromise, she’s completely against the idea.\n\nI understand shared living requires consideration, and I’m trying to be respectful. But I also really need this income and don’t think my request is unreasonable.\n\nWe have 2 rooms and one hall with open kitchen connecting to hall. \n\nSo Reddit—**AITA for wanting to tutor kids at home in the evening even if it might slightly disturb one flatmate?** \n\nA lot of you shared your suggestions and advices. I'm really grateful to you all. \n\nAs of now I'm considering to change in timings for tutoring and making it only one hour **6:30pm-7:30pm**. So that she can study peacefully and don't get disturbed. \n\nWith 5-6 kids at most. \n\nKeeping the environment as quite as possible.\n\n(Also I have noticed while talking to her that she has no problem with the kids if I share my students with her to teach, but I'm really not in favor of it considering I reached out to everyone for tutoring despite being new here and there is a chance I don't get as much kids as expected.) \n\nOn a side note-\n\nThere are no libraries within a radius of 5km.\n\nI can't afford a space as of now. \n\nThere is no common space available in building.\n\nI need to make money to pay my rent aswell. \n\n\n \n\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I’m in a college apartment with a few roommates, and our lease is ending soon. I won’t be able to return until right before move-out, so I sent a message in the group chat trying to get ahead of cleaning tasks. One of my roommates doesn’t clean much at all, and I wanted to make sure we didn’t all get charged for missed areas that landlords check (behind the stove, cabinets, etc.).\n\nI’ll paste the full back-and-forth below, including my messages and their replies, word-for-word. After this exchange, my friends told me I was being “passive-aggressive” and “too managerial,” and that I should’ve just said something more relaxed like, “Hey, can you guys clean up a little?” I’m frustrated because I didn’t insult anyone, just tried to be responsible, and yet I got told I’m the one creating tension.\n\n⸻\n\nHere’s the full exchange:\n\nMe: “[RM1] and [RM2], I would clean whatever you can that isn’t used daily or dirtied daily before the few days before move-out (fridge, pulling out stove, cleaning some cabinets, etc). I wish I could help, but I won’t be able to do so potentially until the days leading up to move out or the night before.”\n\nRM1: “Relax\nI vacuum weekly”\n\n\nMe: “Can’t tell if that’s a joke or not (probably is), but I’m not sure if you’ve moved out of a rental before — place has to be near spotless or they nickel and dime\n\nThey’ll be sending us a checklist about move out details with cleaning information. I’ll do my best to make up for some things since I can’t be there. I cleansed underneath the burner drip trays when I was there (oven top actually pops up and that’ll probably be on the list.\n\nDoing some of those larger jobs little by little before move out will ensure that nobody is scrambling to preserve the security deposit as best we can.”\n\nRM1: “Man please get a job or hop on some dick\nWe’re gonna be fine”\n\n⸻\n\nFor the record: I didn’t insult anyone, didn’t demand anything, and offered to do whatever I could once I return. And still — that’s the kind of response I got.\n\nSo… AITA for how I worded this?\n",

      "scenario_description": "I (19F) have a niece who I sometimes watch every now and then for my older sister. I love my niece and sister, but I don’t really like children all that much, and she can very much be a handful (i.e: Tantrums, not potty trained, the usual kid stuff). \n\nI’ve recently agreed to watch her a little more often because my sister just recently started a second job and doesn’t have any reliable child care for that second job on the weekends. I offered to watch her this weekend, and I could have sworn I only agreed to just weekends. But apparently, my sister has left the country and won’t be back for another week. She had mentioned wanting me to watch her for a week trip she’s taking, but never once gave me more in depth details like dates, how long she’d be gone, and other important things like that. She had only mentioned the trip in passing and really only jokingly asking me if I could take her with me making jokes back about how I’d have to train. When this weekend was coming up and she had called prior, she had only mentioned this weekend and not a whole week. \n\nI honestly feel like I got suckered into a full week for a trip when I only seriously agreed to helping her out on weekends for work, not for a trip she takes pretty often. I had talked to my parents and they both believe that she wasn’t fully honest with me, and now I’m stuck with a toddler for a week. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I backed out of watching her for a while because of this? I love my niece and while I don’t mind watching her, I don’t want to agree to something that won’t be fully explained to me. \n\nEdit: Just for some clarity, she did leave her with more than enough supplies, I did get some cash so I won’t say I didn’t get anything out of it, I don’t think there were any other child care options that would have taken her while my sister left. She also didn’t pull a leave her on my doorstep otherwise I would have definitely reported it, but she did do a drop and run (I didn’t get to say goodbye before she even left she ran out so fast). \n\nI’m so sorry if I left anything super vague, but I can thankfully say with certainty that the baby isn’t in danger with her or has been abandoned by her mom (I have training in this area to see signs). However, she definitely did pull a fast one on me, and I really just wanted clarity and honesty so I could mentally prepare and arrange my schedule. I’m so sorry if I left anything too vague for, and I do want to emphasize that the baby is safe!!\n\nSemi-update: Hi! I have no idea if anyone wants this very tiny update or not but here it is. I’ve learned that my sister has only left the country today. I’ve had the kid since Thursday, and my sister only met up with her friends Friday night. I’m beyond frustrated because I’ve had a kid that’s not mine for longer than needed and I’ve caused my poor pets more stress than need (they don’t like babies I’ve learned). I haven’t slept in my own bed in three days (we don’t have a room for her to sleep in, so I stay with her on the couch so my pets have their own space still), I smell like a sticky toddler, and I feel completely tricked. \n\nI’ll hopefully be able to give my niece back before Sunday, but who knows. The one thing that I do know for a fact is that I won’t be babysitting for a very long time after this. She’ll have to find someone else to watch her for work. ",
