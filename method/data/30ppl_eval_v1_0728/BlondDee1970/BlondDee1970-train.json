      "post_title": "AITAH for telling my husband I don’t want to homeschool his kids?",
      "scenario_description": "Am I the asshole for telling My husband that I really don’t want to homeschool his kids? We have four kids, 2 teens and a 10 yo girl and 1 yo boy, one teen and the 10 yo are his from a previous woman, our 1yo is ours together and my teen daughter from my ex. He told me he really wants me to homeschool both his schoolage kids, his 10 yo is a handful, we have a mostly good relationship now but the first couple years was bumpy and she still has problems following rules and instructions, so I can imagine teaching her anything would put a serious wedge between us and his teen son doesn’t listen to me at all, he’s very disobedient. The school year when they go to school (very nice private school btw) it’s a nice break for me and I’m a sahm and I also help with his business on top of taking care of all house chores and cooking/shopping and the kids plus their homework and taking them to all after school and summer activities. I think I would lose my mind If I had to add homeschooling to my plate. Am I wrong for telling him I need that break each day away from the kids?\n\nEDIT: to answer any questions, he wants me to HS to avoid bad influence, but they have been going to school their entire school age lives, they have already been influenced, that ship sailed. \n\nI am 100% not qualified to teach, nor do I have the patience. When his daughter fell behind in math I would help her with homework, and even with all distractions off, she could not focus on the task and would bounce around, ask unrelated questions and not pay attention to what I am teaching. So I can imagine teaching her would be a nightmare for both of us. \n\nI get allowance each month plus bills paid, access to card and bank account, so our marriage outside of him bugging me about HS is great, he takes good care of us, but the fact that he’s asked so many times and I have told him that me teaching them would hurt their education and also our relationship plus the many other valid reasons and that still hasn’t deterred him makes me question if he truly sees everything I do and if it’s enough. I don’t want to be selfish, I would do anything for my kids and my family, but that also means putting my foot down on something that I know could be detrimental to them even if he doesn’t see it. ",

      "scenario_description": "I'm pretty sure I'm NTA, but isn't everyone who posts here? I'll let you decide.\n\nI'm independently... well, I wouldn't call myself \"wealthy\", but I'm \"overly comfortable\" in terms of finance. No debts, and I have (or rather, HAD) a 7 figure bank account. I've worked my ass off for that money. None of this is said to brag - it's the root of my question.\n\nMy problem started about 4 years ago, during the height of COVID. My boss, who was quite aware of the money I was making, and well aware that I wasn't planning any holidays for obvious reasons, asked me if I would be okay with lending him about half my accumulated wealth to start a new business venture. He agreed to a generous interest rate, and a payment plan, all on paper, all good.\n\nWell, the rest of his family found out about the loan. As did some friends. And the requests for \"small loans, just a couple of weeks\" started rolling in.\n\nI know, I know. I'm an idiot for saying yes, even when the \"couple of weeks\" passed without a single word from the ones who borrowed money from me. \n\nAnd it kept going.\n\nI'm down to about 4% of my actual money in my bank account. The rest is all \"loaned\" out to people who have promised to pay me back months, if not years ago. Radio silence on their ends.\n\nHere's where I am probably the AH. Recently, another friend, who is suffering from a chronic illness, has asked me for yet another \"loan\". She already owes me about $500000, and she wants $30000 more. \n\nI said no. For the first time in my life, it feels like.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't feel bad for refusing, but I do. I've accepted the fact that I've been a doormat for far, far too long. But I can't shake this feeling that my refusal to, once again, throw money at someone who's made ZERO effort to repay any previous loans, is an asshole move, because she really is sick.\n\nSince then, I've said no to three other people who've asked for \"loans\".\n\nSo, am I the asshole, or just a doormat idiot?\n\nEdit: autocarrot error",

A lot of it it interesting, but I dont see this as a healthy way of looking at people. It automatically assumes that \"people are sick and need help in some way,\" which isn't wrong, but there are so many other ways to see people. Its been like this since our entire relationship. Its almost all she talks about.\n\nNow, ive been having a ton of mental health issues (panic attacks daily for 4 months or so now), and its still all she wants to talk about. \n\nI feel like its horribly unhelpful. All i feel like she's saying is \"I'm sick we're sick im sick we're sick I'm sick we're sick I'm sick we're sick, the only solution is meds and counseling,\" and I find it exhausting.\n\nI set a boundary for her to only talk about mental health and psych meds on my own terms. Its been whiddling away at me since well before I started getting panic attacks. Now, my whole world is having appointments, finding appointments, and talking about this with everyone, and im tired of it I have counseling twice a week (plus so much more), and i cancelled one of my apps today becaude of this exhaustion. I feel like the whole world is screaming YOURE SICK YOURE SICK YOURE SICK, and that its a negative affirmation loop.\n\nI set the boundary, and she doesnt know what to do with it. She's clueless, and seems a bit hurt. \n\nIMTAH?",

      "scenario_description": "This is a throwaway account because people I know know my real acct. I need a perspective on this outside of my family to know if I'm not treating this event with enough importance.\n\nSo my sister had the first baby of our family and we're all so happy about it, but she's also treating her kid like he should be the center of our universe. Examples being constantly spamming our group texts with photos of him, turning EVERY conversation to be about him, etc.  \nThis attitude is supported by her husband's parents and both of my parents. My sister and her husband are having a big birthday party in 3 weeks for his first birthday and expecting us to be a there.\n\nI begrudgingly bought tickets to fly for the event a month ago. I'm gonna be honest: While I LOVE my nephew, I was already kindof dreading the party even though I'm willing to go through with it just to show support. There are a LOT of jerks amongst my sister's friends and her husbands family (these will be the majority of the 50ish guests present). I also find giant celebrations for a baby who will not remember it to be obnoxious. I would much rather just send a gift and celebrate my nephew in a visit one-on-one vs. spend $$$ on a plane ticket for an event where I socially suffer and I don't even really get to have real quality time with my nephew.\n\nAnother thing is that now an important work engagement is coming up for that same week. I'm considering canceling my plane ticket because I don't see how I can make it work without losing out on an important opportunity with my career.  \nMy parents shamed me pretty hard when I mentioned my feelings on it to them privately *(\\*\\*\\*EDIT: \"feelings on it\" meaning that I can't make it happen due to work, NOT my frustration about treating nephew like he's center of the universe)*, and they said I needed to still go to this because it's a big deal for him to turn 1 year old. Like I get that it's a big deal for the grandparents to be there, but me? I just don't really see why it's so important. Please help me see the other side of this - am I being unreasonable if I don't go?\n\nFAQ Notes based on comments I'm getting:\n\n1. I love my nephew and am not jealous of him lol. I am struggling with every conversation getting hijacked into more variations of the same sentiments about what he's doing every second of the day. I want to hear what other family members have going on too and it feels exhausting to get inundated with so many similar/same pics and comments all day every day.\n2. My parents shamed me because they said the baby would \"miss\" me being there. I have not told my parents or sister that I find the nephew oversharing obnoxious. I am keeping that to myself and only shared that here because it's an honest part to the dynamics and personal frustrations.\n3. the plane tickets are roughly $400 and does not include food, transportation and accommodation. It's definitely a financial sting but not totally threatening. I don't need to take off work as I can do remotely but I would be missing out on an in-person opportunity back home which is the bigger sting.\n4. I have met the baby 4 times now and will continue to make lots of efforts to see him if that matters.",

My sister had decided not to bring her dog or invite my younger brother and his 3 young kids ages 2-6 because she did not want to spend her vacation babysitting,she wanted to drink and relax. My older brother and I agreed as we both work high stress jobs and just really need a break. That brings us to today my sister calls me and informs me that my 6 year old niece will be joining us and that we will be baby sitting her for the trip. I am now considering dropping out of the trip for a few reasons, one I feel blindsided that my sister offered to bring our niece along without consulting anyone first. Also I know she did not contact my older brother about this as she knows he would not be okay with taking her. I adore my niece but babysitting her is really taxing she has severe ADHD and is prone to screaming fits when ever she is told no. So I feel that if I go on this trip it will absolutely not be the relaxing trip I have been looking forward to for months.\nWould I be the asshole if I tell my sister I will not be joining them for this trip?\n\nupdate: first of all thank you for the comments. I did want to clear a couple of things up my younger sister does not have any kids and the 6 year old as he is bringing is our youngest brothers kid. Many have pointed out that screaming fits is not a symptom of ADHD and that is correct her ADHD causes her to be hyper and really high energy the temper tantrums are a separate issue. I have not spoken to my sister yet as today is a holiday and I did not want to ruin it for anyone, but today she informed my brother that my niece will not be allowed to bring her tablet as my sister has decided this is a no electronics trip. This is a recipe.for disaster as my niece does not do well on long rides and usually uses her tablet. The ride to the campsite is 3 hours and my sister is expecting my niece to sit quietly. This was a conversation that she made sure to have while my older brother was out of earshot so I will be letting him know what she is planning and will not be going on this trip. My plan is to spend that time at a resort and spa instead",

      "scenario_description": "Help me figure out if I’m in the wrong here. It’s not like a huge problem or anything, just something that’s been on my mind and I want other people’s opinions.\n\nSo, here’s the situation. I have a girlfriend. She works from home, and I work in an office. When I get home, I usually still have around 2.5 hours alone while she’s working. She has a Netflix family account with her sisters. I think there are four people on it, but I’m not sure exactly.\n\nWe’ve been watching a show together on Netflix and recently a new season came out. Yesterday, I waited for her to finish work so we could continue watching it, but she said she didn’t really feel like watching it anymore. I was a bit upset, not because she didn’t want to watch it, but more because we had reached a really exciting part and I wanted to see what happens next.\n\nSo instead, we watched something she wanted to watch, but after a while she got bored and we switched to two other shows. Later, I asked her if she could connect her Netflix account to my laptop so I could watch the show while she works. (She uses her laptop to work, and we connect it to the TV to watch Netflix together afterwards.) But she said no. I asked why, and she told me that their family plan can only have four devices connected.\n\nI felt a bit sad about that. Today we talked about it again, and during the conversation she said I was starting an argument, and that she could just log out of her Netflix on her phone to let me use it. I told her there was no need, and that I wasn’t trying to argue, I just wanted to check again.\n\nI don’t think she’s obligated to watch everything with me, but I just wanted to watch that show. Can someone explain if Netflix really works like that? I’m not looking for people to tell me “you should break up” or “she should break up with you.” It’s just a small situation, and I’m honestly curious if Netflix actually limits devices this way.",

      "scenario_description": "I recently found an monopoly game that is in bad shape.The box itself has rips along the edges and is taped up so that it doesn't fall apart, the board is taped up aswell and even though it has been \"fixed\" the rips cause the figures to tip over on some fields.The figures themselves are falling apart, too. The print is all smudged and on some figures, the face is completely missing because of excessive usage. They also fall out of the little plastic foot, which we \"fixed\" by putting tissue paper in the little slit where you put the figure in so that it hopefully doesn't fall apart during the game. The money is also disgusting, all sticky and crunched up and the cards are torn an crunched up aswell. The only part of this game you could still use are the dice and the houses. Everything else just screams \"please throw me away\". Because my parents bought me this game and I live with them and can't just throw something as big as a board game away without them noticing, I told them that I wanted to throw it out, because 1. it is disgusting and hardly usable anymore and 2. we've played it like a thousand times, so it's not like it was a waste of money.My parents got really angry and told me that some \"poor children that have nothing to play\" (where we live, there are no children like that and also the game is 13+ because it has bars instead of railway stations and weird stuff written on the cards like \"pay 50 bucks because you've got a yeast infection\") and that \"my generation doesn't care about others at all and just wants to throw everything away\" They want me to bring it to this book exchange box that we've got here and I would've done that if the game wasn't falling apart but in this condition, the first person who sees it will throw it away, but I would at least keep the houses and the dice because these are literally the pieces that are missing in our old monopoly, that is otherwise in good condition. I think that my parents are part of the problem why charities here only take new stuff anymore because they just give away trash and act as if someone who doesn't have a lot of money would be grateful.They always try to guilt trip me when I want to throw away old, used stuff that is just not usable anymore. They always tell me that they wasted their money on it if I throw it away, no matter how often I used it. What annoys me even more is the fact that if they get something second hand for free, they always expect it to be in near-mint condition and are angry at the person that gave it away if it is in bad shape.I hate that my parents act as if I'm ungrateful because I want to reuse what still can be used and throw away what's not usable anymore instead of \"donating\" it to feel better about myself. I even showed them how bad it looks and they really looked at that board that is ripping more and more each time you unfold it and said \"yeah, a child (again, this game is NOT for children) will want that and love it more than you probably ever did\" AITA?",

She moved five hours away and makes little to no effort to keep up a friendship despite me often messaging her or asking to meet up when she visits home, which she treats like a chore and always feels “too tired” to meet up. She even started excluding me from gatherings with our larger group of mutual friends. I am not invited to the bachelorette party either which I was surprised by as we used to be close. \n\nAnyway, the destination wedding was going to cost me about $2000 to attend and a week of vacation from work. I decided not to go because I don’t think she is treating me like a good friend and even mentioned she just wants people there because her and her finance get a free room if they have enough rooms booked. However, she is really upset that I’m no longer going and is not speaking to me at all now (though she barely was speaking to me before). AITA? ",

Food, drinks, pool, etc.  When it got dark out, we went out to the front yard street and lit off fireworks.  Nothing illegal or airborne but we had a ton of stuff where we just lit in the street and it looked cool and made loud noises.  We were all drinking beer and watching, a few neighbors came out, about half way through our stash, which was 8-10 minutes in at that point my neighbor comes out and yells at us.  \n\nWe’ve had our conflicts before, but she was fairly aggressive today.  Says her dogs are scared and she didn't have any drugs or whatever for them today since they used them yesterday.  She didn't expect fireworks on the 5th. I just said sorry, but i'm not going to shut the party down or stop lighting fireworks. It’s still the holiday weekend even if its not the actual holiday day.  She called me the asshole, accused me of being an asshole to the neighborhood animals.  I just ignored her and told others to ignore her.  We had the dinky stuff from the grocery store and costco, not the illegal stuff thats actually loud and disruptive.  AITA? ",

      "scenario_description": "There's gonna be a few paragraphs of background to preface the actual event. I highly recommend reading it because I definitely sound like an asshole without context and I want a real and true reading of my situation.\n\nFor context, I (16f, not sure if this is relevant or not) have a lot of online friends. I was basically given unrestricted internet access since I was a kid, so I handle online friendships better than my IRL friends do. I'm a lot more attached to my online friends than most people would be, which my family friends don't like. More context, our family friend group is shallow but had a lot of history. I've always been chronically online, so when I got a phone, I strained my relationship with the group because I was always on it, so I understand why they dislike it when I'm on it. I've been disrespected by a lot of our friends and manhandled (slammed into a wall, crawled on top of, etc) b/c my phone. It's gotten to a point where I can't be on my phone for more than five minutes at a time at hours-long events without being dogged on.\n\nOnto the actual thing, sorry if you were expecting something big. Small context, a portion of our friend group meets up for UNO a few times a month, and I had a new online friend group form a few months ago.\n\nAt these hangouts, I usually go on my phone. Nobody really cared too much because all of the people there literally just did not care to include me (the adults made me feel more included when playing UNO and I HATE hanging with the adults), so I did what I wanted. During the event, I was on a call but you couldn't really tell because I usually text when I can't talk.\n\nLike I said, anti-climactic situation. There wasn't a fight, we just had an awkward conversation after they literally grabbed my phone out of my hands while playing mafia because I had my eyes closed. I ended up telling them I was on a call, they made a few snarky comments before one of them had to leave and the hangout devolved until they were watching America's Got Talent auditions.\n\nI think it's pretty obvious that they think I'm annoying and a jerk for not hanging out with them and calling people outside the friend group instead of talking to them, and I understand how it looks because despite playing mafia with them, I was pretty checked out of the game and I was talking to my other friends instead. I get that it's a jerk move to be checked out of a social event, but it's been four years and I really cannot capture how absolutely terrible it was to be around them when they acted like every time I pulled my phone out I was going to fall back into my 13-year-old self, and then have them completely ignore me in favor of each other and THEN getting mad when I got tired of it and went back on my phone to talk to people who actually gave a shit about me. The only reason I'm putting this here is because I used to go to a therapist to reduce my phone activity so I might be looking at this situation in a skewed manner. So am I the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "I 27F just got engaged to the love of my life. I have a group of four bridesmaids, all of whom are in late 20s. This story specifically concerns one bridesmaid who I'll call Ellie.\n\nFor bachelorette-type events I am doing two things. One is in my town for dress fittings, spa treatments, followed by a night out, and a brunch the next day. The other is a 2-day Disney trip. I invited all the bridesmaids except Ellie to Disney and said it was because we all know she has limited paid time off and I want to prioritize the day in town because it's more special to have us all be able to really spend time together.\n\nThis was not entirely true. While she has limited PTO, that wasn't the reason why she wasn't invited. Honestly, she's a big girl. I'd estimate upwards of 250lbs. This doesn't matter, she's gorgeous and I love her, but it does affect her ability to participate in anything with even moderate physical activity. For example, last year, we had walked about 1/2 a mile to a restaurant in 75 degree weather and she was out of breath within about 2 minutes and needed to recover in the AC for a solid 10 minutes after we got to the restaurant before Ellie was really able to engage in the conversation. Another time, we went on a \"hike\" in the park which was a flat 1/3 mile loop and I had to pretend that I needed a break because it was obvious she was struggling and I didn't want her to feel embarrassed for needing a break. I'm also somewhat worried that she wouldn't be able to fit in some of the rides.\n\nI really, really don't want to be mean and exclude her but I also know what's going to happen if she comes. She's going to be exhausted and need to sit down or find AC. We're going to feel bad and hang out with her so she doesn't get left behind. Ellie would of course never ask us to wait for her or anything but that's what friends do.\n\nA few days ago, Ellie called me and said she was hurt to not be invited and that she would take unpaid time off to join. I tried to say we had already booked the hotel, she said she would find accommodations. When she asked for a third time, I finally told her that we're going to be doing a lot of walking and I wasn't sure if she could keep up. I don't want her to feel embarrassed or unwelcome, but her weight makes it hard for her to enjoy herself and it brings the mood down. I didn't specifically say anything about weight but she immediately took it as me calling her fat. I mean, I kind of was. I support her existing in any shape or size, but some shapes and sizes make activities a lot harder.\n\nAITA for telling a friend she couldn't keep up on a Disney trip?",

My siblings and I have been taking turns driving her to doctors appointments, the grocery store, and just anywhere she needs to go. \n\nMy sister is a stay at home mom to one kid. My other siblings and I all work. I have the most flexible job and was able to take time off to get her to appointments, so I did them more often. But it’s been getting to the point where it is hurting my performance at my job. My two other siblings have more strict jobs but will do things for her after work or on the weekends. \n\nI told my sister we need her to step up more and bring her to appointments. I can’t keep taking time off of work for her appointments because I also have my own health I need to take care of and I have cancelled my own appointments because I can only do mine or my moms. Not both. \n\nShe says she can’t because she has a child. Her child is in daycare 3 days per week, so she has 3 days without a child. She says she needs to catch up on chores those days and what if her kid gets sick and needs to be picked up? She also says she can’t do it the other days because she has plans with her kid and if she has to drive my mom somewhere, it’s getting in the way of her and her child. \n\nI told her I can’t keep do a majority of the appointments like I have. My manager has been understanding but I am getting behind and putting a lot of burden on others during my time off. She is home and home alone for 3 days, she can budget out a few hours to help out. \n\nShe said I wouldn’t get it because I don’t have kids. I told her I know what it’s like to not have kids 3 days per week and without a job, she will have time. \n\nAITA for telling her she needs to step up more to help out our sick mom?",

      "scenario_description": "TL;DR: Parents sold grandmas cabin they inherited to their next door neighbors son+investors at a steep discount, knowing it was really important to me and that I wanted to keep it in the family, didn't tell me they were selling it until it was under contract / in escrow, then were super dismissive of their actions being hurtful. AITA for uninviting them to my daughters birthday party because I couldn't be in the same room with them right now without being visibly upset and didn't want to take away from my daughters party?\n\nMy grandma died around 5 years ago and had a summer cabin that she and the family would spend time at. I would spend the entire summer there with her when I was a young kid, so I had a lot of memories there. Growing up I always heard about how someday it would be passed down to me, and I always had the impression it was grandmas intention was that it would stay in the family. I felt like she gave it to my parents, because my grandma thought my parents would try to keep it in the family.\n\nOn a call with my mom, she said in passing they were getting an escrow check tomorrow and stuff moved out since they sold the cabin. I was shocked. They mentioned they sold it to their next door neighbors son and had gotten about $380k. A real estate agent told them they were leaving $50-75k on the table and they shouldn't sell at that price, and looking at comps which were around $480k-650k, I would concur $380k for the cabin was a really (almost insulting) low price. IMHO it was sold at least $100k under market value.\n\nThey said they moved quick because my dad is having a major back surgery, and maintenance was too much... I have always been vocal that I wanted to figure something out and how important it was to me. When I asked my dad, did you really want to sell it, the answer was no he didn't, but he didn't want to have any more fights with my mom about spending money on the cabin.\n\nWhen I explained how much it hurt and felt like a betrayal that they didn't even involve me, or let me make a counter offer their only reaction was to dismiss my feelings and justify their actions. Knowing they gave the neighbors son such a good deal, when they have never been even 10% as generous to me or my brothers, over our entire lifetime, let alone a single transaction is tough. I didn't think that I could be in the same room with them right now without being visibly upset, and there was no way I could focus solely on my daughter/family for her birthday party with my parents there. The party was great btw, had friends and my daughter had a great time!\n\nSince my grandma gave the cabin to my parents, as far as I am concerned, they can do with the place as they wish. But the way they did it feels really fucked up and not OK. The cherry on top is it wasn't like they needed to sell, it was just convenient for them.\n\nBut it has me thinking... AITA for feeling hurt/betrayed about this? AITA for uninviting them from our daughters birthday party?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi Reddit, it's my first time posting and I'm sobbing as we speak while writing this. All though both my parents, Mom(F47) and Dad(M50) believe I have a misguided sense of anger and am projection my anger onto the boy who we'll call K.\n\nThis story starts at first when I, (F16), was 9, having just came home from school, my dad pulled me outside to have a chat (it is too be noted that me and my dad had and still do have a strained relationship bc of the way he acts and his inability to control his anger). It was then I was told I would have a younger sister R (F7) bc he impregnated his manager (Not my mom). At the time I was okay with it due to the fact all three of my older sibling are significantly older than me (M27, M22 and F21) and it would be my first time being an older sister. IT was HELL because her mom put my mom and me through hell all while being lovey-dovey with my dad. As well as my younger sister R has mental problems because of the hell she was put through and occasionally lashes out.\n\nNow back to current year, I am called by my dad and told I have a baby brother K (M1) and my dad wants to see him. I am HEAVILY against this because My life for the last 7 years has been centered around my little sister and her problems while I'm just here trying to adjust. I told my dad and mom \"I understand thats his son, but I only have 4 siblings, and he is and will not be my brother. Why is it okay for my mom to say she wont do anything for the baby but will for his first affair child?\" Why am I expected to be okay with someone who is another reminder my father doesn't give a shit about my mom or me. I was told that my anger was misguided but I don't think I am. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My girlfriend of 1 year and I have a loving and healthy relationship. The woman of my dreams. We met in my home province and she is from another province (12 hour drive to her hometown). I have attended Christmas/Holiday season in her hometown for two weeks, and was just there for over a week this month. Both times using some of my vacation time. \n\nThe wedding is in September and my girlfriend is the maid of honour. She’s busy for about two days straight and I’m expected to stay/hang out with people I’ve never met (that’s fine tbh) or by myself. But she wants to go for over a week to see family, recuperate from the long drive, etc. The problem is that I teach two university courses in the fall and will be starting a new research position. I’ve had to spend a ton of money on her, travel, moving, dates, gifts for defending her dissertation, etc, am feeling it, and want to settle in September.  I’ve done a lot for her and I told her I can’t see myself being able to go to this wedding, but will 100% take time to attend her graduation in the same province/area in October, and go to her home for this years Holiday in December. \n\nI’ve met the bride to be and her fiancé once for an hour. I am stressed to the max and tried explaining that being put in this position adds a lot onto me. She is upset, but then won’t talk to me about it and goes into another room. \n\nI want some outside perspective. I feel like a jerk but had to put my foot down and do what’s best for me…given that I have primarily done as much as I can for her at this point in the relationship. \n\nSo am I the asshole for saying I can’t go to this wedding?",

      "scenario_description": "I am a 22-year-old NB person that will be graduating next week with a 1st Class BA Hons degree in the arts- I have the highest grades in my family and will be starting an MA in September at the same university. I live in a different city than my family due to this.\n\nI initially did not want to attend graduation as I didn't have the best time at my BA, but because my mother had already bought the picture frame for my graduation photo, I decided to go along with it for her sake. Our relationship is very strained due to a very messy childhood. \n\nWhen the topic of the post-ceremony meal came up, I suggested that we go to somewhere like Pizza Express (a pizza restaurant in the UK) or a Brazilian Steakhouse (my mother and biological father are both Brazilian, and I grew up with the cuisine and haven't tried the ones in my city despite being here for 3 years). My mother immediately shut both of those choices down, as her partner wouldn't enjoy them. He is not allergic to anything as far as I am aware.\n\nHer partner is a man who doesn't enjoy leaving the city or village he's spent his whole life in and who doesn't enjoy other cuisines; he also is a hater of the arts and dislikes me for a reason I cannot understand. He didn't go to university, has some very choice words on specific topics (such as landlords, gender identity and immigration) and said that I've wasted 3 years of my life messing around by being at university. I wasn't going to initally invite him to my graduation, but my brother will be on holiday so I needed the space filled up.\n\nInstead, she picked out a restaurant that is very far from both my apartment and the main city, expecting me to pay for both the Uber there and my own meal. I brought up this up to her, saying that she has put her partner above me- I retorted with the fact that he could just try something new for my sake and she got very defensive. \n\n  \nI have to already keep my mouth shut around her partner for not just the reasons mentioned above, but also because he is the guarantor of my apartment- so I was left with no option but to book a table at the resturant my mother picked out. \n\n  \nAm I the Asshole for being unhappy with my graduation meal because of my mother's partner?\n\n\nETA:\n\n- My mother and her partner are not married and don't plan to marry as far as I am aware.\n- My mother divorced my biological father when I was younger and I haven't spoken with him in 5 years due to my own personal issues with him. \n- My mother's partner refuses to talk to me at all; I can't even ask him about 'safe' topics such as football or how he is.\n- I have a job, of which I am on sick leave for, so I do pay my way. \n- My mother and her partner paid £150 for train tickets before even asking me what I wanted the plans to be.\n- I have texted my mother about how I feel pressured to do things and how she doesn't put me first as her child; she said she doesn't deserve the things I said. \n- I put my gender and age in the opening of this because people do that sort of thing on reddit AFAIK; but my mother has threatened to out me as trans to her partner because she \"doesn't like keeping secrets\".

      "scenario_description": "I (20F) live in student halls where all parcels go to the reception and need to be picked up promptly. I once got told off by the receptionist for not picking mine up within a few days (I was sick at the time and hadn't left my room), and ever since then, she’s given me dirty looks.\n\nBecause of this, I’m very careful about collecting my parcels on time—and I’ve told my friend Nancy (22F) about this. She occasionally sends her packages to my place because it’s safer than her own, and I’ve always been okay with it *as* long *as* she picks them up quickly. The issue is, she never does. I always have to remind her, and one time, her package sat in my tiny room for over a week. (Note: my room has almost no storage space, which is why I prefer things to stay at reception until picked up.)\n\nNancy lives about an 8-minute walk from me, so it’s not like she has to travel far.\n\nLast Wednesday, she asked again to send something to my address. I said okay, but reminded her (again) to pick it up ASAP. On Saturday, I happened to be running errands near her place, so I offered to drop it off. She said she was too lazy to get out of bed and open the door (she lives on the 4th floor, no elevator). She told me to text her if I would be free later that day, but I already told her then that I would most likely not be.)\n\nOn Monday, she asked to come pick it up Tuesday. I said yes. Then Tuesday evening, she canceled and said she’d come Wednesday instead. That’s when I got frustrated and reminded her she had told me “not to worry.” She gave excuses like being \"naked in bed\" and that I couldn't expect for her to \"drop everything in such a short notice\" on that whole Saturday situation. (I told her I would be there in 40mins, which I think its plenty of time to just put clothes on, walk down and open her front door). She also pointed out that I \"didn't text her so she assumed I was busy\". (I am of the opinion that she should be the one checking when I'm free, not the other way around). I told her all of this (), and that I wasn’t trying to argue, just holding her to what she promised.\n\nShe kept making more excuses, including that she expected me to bring it on Friday (we’d talked loosely about hanging out with our other friends, but I never confirmed I’d be there, and she never asked me to bring the parcel anyway). She also said she has been really busy and picking up the package wasn't a priority. So I asked why she had it sent to me if she knew she’d be too busy to collect it and if she knew how particular I am about quick pickups.\n\nI ended up telling her I’m not her assistant and that I found her behavior disrespectful. I do get irritated easily, but this was the first time I’ve been this blunt and direct with her.\n\nAITA?\n\nI would also like advice on how to proceed from here. Also, she mentioned before that the package was just vitamins and ngl I feel like sticking them in the microwave to ruins its efficacy. (It's not any serious medication, just vit B and magnesium - she told me she got them because \"smart people r taking brain supplements\". Is that too much?",

      "scenario_description": "EDITED TO CLARIFY. \nMy husband (35m) and I (33f) are expecting our second child this summer. We have the c section date schedule, so like, it’s coming soon.. soon soon. With our first, my MIL stayed at our house to care for our three dogs and a cat while we were in the hospital having the first baby, also by c section. We were there 3 nights. This go around we still have the same house, same pets (minus two dogs, RIP the good boy and girl) add a toddler and are planning on leaving a day earlier since we have a better idea of what we’re doing. Initially she was game to stay at our house with our toddler (2.5m) and our pets, and she already took off work those days to be here…so we didn’t make any other plans. Now speaking with her. She’s trying to convince us that she needs to stay at her house with our toddler and we can just take the dog somewhere and we can pick both up the day we come home. I told my husband absolutely not. If that’s the game, then we will find some other family member who will either watch both at their house or who will stay here for both. We’re not even asking her to stay all day.. and the toddler goes to day care during the day. We’re just looking for someone to be here in the evenings for the dog to have company and be taken care of twice a day and so the toddler can stay in his house and routine. It’s literally two nights unless something goes wrong. AITA? \n\nAdditional info:\nDog is DOG reactive. Loves people. No bite history. No other dogs around. Only has health issues when severely stressed, but none for a while. Couch potato dog. \n\nMIL was happy to agree to this in November when  asked. Confirmed it again sometime in April, still happy to help and stay at our house. When told the date of c section, in 3 weeks, changed her mind while on the phone. We mentioned having FIL (they’re divorced) watch both. She doesn’t want that only wants GC. \n\nMILs house is not childproofed. No gates for steps and a dog that HAS bit toddler. Plus 3 cats that have also bit and scratched toddler. \n",

To my shock, our colleague had no job whatsoever, and every time I would come home from work and find him just sleeping all day. After two weeks, I decided to confront my friend about what was going on. He explained to me that he had some issues with his accommodation and needed to stay with us for while. He agreed to this with him without informing me. I was deeply uncomfortable with this arrangement as I literally don’t have any privacy whatsoever. I work 6days a week and the only time I have a bit of privacy is on my off-day when my roommate goes to work. But here is someone else who is always in the house with me with no job whatsoever. I later asked when this situation would end and he couldn’t tell and was afraid of confronting this colleague. I decided to confront our colleague later on to ask about what was going on and his plan moving forward. After a series of flimsy excuses, I made it clear he cannot continue to live with us and should sort his way within 2weeks. As agreed, he left two weeks after.\n\nFast forward three weeks later, I woke up to ease myself in the middle of the night and saw luggages and some people in the room on my roommate’s bed. I saw him sitting outside and he told me that our colleague’s wife and her 4-month old twins had moved in after falling out with the woman they were staying with. I just went to the restroom and went back to sleep. Now, it’s been 5days, and we have this family staying with us in this cramped room. The twins cry every night that it’s difficult to sleep. The father has only been here once to see them and this feels like I’m reliving the whole saga with the husband again. I’m at a loss right now. I feel like my roommate is selfishly acting as a Good Samaritan at my own expense. Am I an asshole for wanting them to leave?",

      "scenario_description": "for context me(33M) got into an argument recently with my mother, for the first 25 years of my life i was pretty much the punching bag for my family, i would get the short end of the stick on almost everything, constantly belittled and talked down to, and just treated like I was extremely dumb.. it caused me severe depression from a young age, which i told my parents about at the time, and they laughed it off saying i didn't have anything to be depressed over because i was too young, coupled with that and doing things like sending me to summer camp then literally forgetting to pick me up for 2 days after the camp was over while my counselor is trying to get a hold of them, has had a lasting effect on me, a little while ago i was able to overcome my own depression and kinda kick my ass into gear, i had a mid life crisis and realized that this depression was going to have me wind up homeless without anything to my name, so i changed, and as i did, i gained respect for myself and started creating boundaries that i wouldn't let people cross, being disrespected and talked down to is one of those boundaries. \n\nMost of the time when my parents make rude of off-handed comments i let it slide, but you can only poke the bear for so long before you get a reaction right? well today they received my reaction, and i'll admit, i was pretty heated, yelling and being aggressive, but i did so because my family doesn't listen to me when i try to share with them that these things bother me(disrespecting me and talking shit about me behind my back to the rest of the family) in return i got the famous deer in the headlights look when someone is flabbergasted you just reacted the way you did, but mind you this isn't the first, second , third, fourth , fifth or even sixth time i've had this conversation about them making rude off handed comments about me, nothing changed any prior conversation they always told me \"they'd try to work on it\" then it would be the same old a day or two later.. basically making me feel like im trapped in a perpetual loop of them talking shit about me until it's too much for me to bear and i explode on them for it, and then they turn and act like the victim and like i've egregiously wronged them for standing up for myself. the weird thing is, i feel bad for reacting the way i did, i don't think anyone enjoys arguing or fighting with their parents, but i also feel partially that they deserved the reaction they got because of the constant crap they put me through.\n\n  \nI feel like i may be the asshole because i lashed out pretty aggressively and said some pretty hurtful things trying to get back for their lack of even basic human respect for me on stuff. but i got to be honest it felt really good and i don't feel that bad about it.. you can only treat someone poor for so long before you get a reaction out of them..\n\nWhat do you guys think, AITA? or am i justified for my aggressiveness?",

      "scenario_description": "For context, my(31F) husband(32M) broke his ankle the day before Memorial Day which resulted in him needing surgery. With him unable to walk and on crutches, I have been doing everything for him and the kids. I’ve been doing all the household chores, mowing the lawn, taking kids to and from school, bringing my husband to appointments, all while working 40hr weeks in a stressful job that just recently had 6 people leave and workload has tripled. I’m stressed, overwhelmed and exhausted. My husband had an appointment today and he is to start weight bearing as tolerated with his crutches and move up to weight bearing without them over the next month.   \nSo tonight after the kids went down, my husband and I decided to watch a movie together and eat some ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I mentioned I wanted something salty to munch on and he asked if I would get him some chips too. I jokingly, with a silly smile and tone, said “I guess I can do that” and I got up to get us chips and he said “how ever will I repay you?” And wiggled his eyebrow in that sexy way hinting he wants me. I put on a big smile and said “with a week to myself” he laughed, I laughed and went to the kitchen to get chips. I came back and all the sudden his demeanor changed and he looked at me and asked “should I go upstairs so you can start your week to yourself” in a salty tone. I instantly was defeated. I wasn’t trying to fight with him, I was making a joke and he laughed so I thought he understood it was a joke. I sighed, took my chips back to the kitchen and decided to go to bed. I did not have any fight in me to deal with this. He came upstairs shortly after and said “I’m sorry I’m not doing okay” I didn’t respond because I didn’t have a response so he says “are you not going to acknowledge me” so I turn towards him and just stare at him. He then says “I’m sorry, it just rubbed me the wrong way and I know you’re stressed and need time to yourself too” I turned back over and said it didn’t matter. So Reddit, AITA?  \n  \n\nUpdate: My husband and I talked. I apologized for my reaction of just shutting down and ignoring him and asked him about him not feeling okay. We had a good conversation about our mental loads lately and we both listened and understood the other. If I could take time off I would but unfortunately I’m not able to and I’m also not in the financial position to hire outside help with my husband out of work. I appreciate everyone’s perspective! When I initially shut down and walked away from him I just needed to regroup myself before talking it through. I have very poor self worth so my mind instantly goes into “everything is my fault” mode and my husband is fully aware of this. I’m grateful that we are able to just talk to each other, even if it takes us a minute to get there.\nAlso, because this was brought up a lot, I had declined sex about 15mins before we started watching the movie. I honestly didn’t want to have to take another shower lol",

I assume it would’ve been for AT LEAST 2 hours plus a 25 minute commute each way. I wanted the $40 strictly for gas to get there and back, plus just as some light compensation for my time. They quickly said no and just left it at that. When telling the story to my family member, they said I was asking for too much money, and at most should’ve asked for $20. \n\nFor context, the person who asked me to watch the kids got demoted recently and is making 50-60 an hour instead of 70, so they’ve been tight on money, but I’ve literally never asked for money from them before, and I’ve watched their kids multiple times for free. \n\nIs there a better way I should’ve gone about this?

They said when they settle they would like to invite us round for dinner (hasn’t happened but kind to say.) We know their names and say hello in passing and I’ve even sent his CV/resume to my workplace when he was looking for work. So yesterday he knocks round and says could we discuss childcare options with each other as we as parents all work and may need extra help so we may need them to have our son occasionally and we could have their children round. We are both full time workers but incredibly organised so have all childcare booked and planned until October. I felt I wanted to be neighbourly and say yes of course BUT also hesitant as I dont want to be saddled with kids I barely know all the time and know for sure we simply dont need extra help. Should I have given it more time before I said “thats kind of you to consider us but we are genuinely ok! Thanks!” Feel like I may have dismissed him? AITA???",

      "scenario_description": "So this is  brought to memory by another recent post about lines. \n\nI was in the post office, and the line was medium long, not terrible. I got to the front, and was sending something that required an additional form (unknown to me or the clerk at the start). I took the form and the clerk told me to step to the side, then when I was done, come back to the front of the line. \n\nSo I'm standing right to the side of the clerk, dutifully filling out the form, and I finish. She's dealing with someone else now, so I wait patiently. Meanwhile the next person in line (behind the \"wait here\" line, so about 6 feet away from us) starts huffing and puffing. At first I don't realize she's huffing at me, but I turn around and see her glaring. I realize that maybe she didn't see my interaction and thinks I'm cutting the line. I politely let her know, \"Oh, hey, I was already in line, the clerk told me to come right back after I filled it out\". But apparently she thought I was lying, or didn't care, because she makes some comments about going to the back of the line, and keeps huffing and puffing about it to her friend in line. Finally, (and here's where maybe I was an AH too) I get tired of her trying to get my attention, and let loose a Gen X \"ok, whatever\".\n\nI ignore her for the next five minutes, and then the clerk says next. I step up to her, but this lady in line tries to rush up too, saying \"I'm next, please!!\". The clerk lets her know I was already in line, and after a minute she goes back to huffing and puffing (like a steam kettle, it was weird). I finish my business, and leave. \n\nI felt a little bad afterwards, I'm not sure if there was proper etiquette for that very specific situation, but it felt like I never stepped away from actively working with the clerk, and obviously was following her instructions, and tried to politely let the lady know. Should I have announced myself when I was done? Would you have assumed you needed to let the person in line know? I mean, I can see how it might have been polite to say \"oh hey, I'm not cutting, she asked me to just come right back up\", but honestly, it didn't even occur to me at the time. ",

      "scenario_description": "So my best friend since 15 years (we are both 32) is getting married next week. Me and het other very good friend (33) organized the bachelorette. I know the bride doesn't like surprises, so I asked her what she wanted. Fancy dinner with everyone, she said.\n\nSo me and other bridesmaid organized for 6 women a stay in a wellness hotel a Michelin star restaurant and brunch on Sunday, to come back that day. I discussed this with the bride and she was excited. The total cost per person was about €300, before any other costs like cocktails in the city, etc (we covered all costs for the bride). Eventuelly, it was almost €400.\n\nI am a single mom and my mother suddenly wasn't feeling \"babysitting\" anymore. This is really annoying and unfortunately, not the first time she does this. For this reason we arrived at 14h in stead of 11h30.\n\nHowever, when we arrived, the hotel let us know that the wellness/spa was closed for maintenance. They did not at all let us know prior, this is a very expensive hotel so they offered us a 25% discount and free breakfast. We asked for alternatives but the alternatives were so expensive that I said in all honestly that I didn't want to pay another €150 per person on top of the already expensive night out.\n\nWe went for cocktails in the city the whole afternoon, we had an amazing dinner, had some more cocktails afterwards and went to sleep at around 2am. The next morning, we had breakfast in the hotel, not brunch in the city - I was honestly not going to skip this free breakfast in the hotel if they offered, even if the city brunch would have been different. Afterwards we strolled in the city for a while. I did however have to be home in time (around 15h), because of my babysitting situation. Initially we weren't even going to sleep over.\n\nI felt the bride being grumpy since Saturday. She made passive aggressive comments the whole time. When we were discussing the price of another wellness, she rolled her eyes when I said it was too expensive.\n\nShe ordered a €90 bottle of champagne to the room (the room that she is NOT paying for, without prior discussion). She bitched about my mom not babysitting for hours, even though I cannot help this, I have no support system and it only cost us an hour and a half, TOPS 2 hours extra. On Sunday she was downright rude. \n\nShe is now angry because I didn't make her weekend \"special enough\". She compares it to the bachelor party her groom had and how special that was. I'm devastated because this was really hard for me to arrange, with my daughter, moneywise I spent WAY too much money on this, I couldn't help it that the spa was closed, I did exactly what she wanted. Her sister tells me that the bride had expected something \"a bit more planned\" and \"a bit more special\". Mind you, I planned half the wedding, I designed the invitations, I ASKED what she wanted for her bachelorette. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My husband (36M) is a teacher and does not work in the summer and our son (18m/oM) is in daycare full-time. I (34F) work full time, Monday through Friday, year round. During the school year (about 9 months a year) I am solely responsible for getting our son up and off to day care with little or no help from his dad, who has to be at work earlier than I do. And on most weekends during the school year and the summer I give my husband at least one day to sleep in. I rarely get to sleep in, it’s usually only if I am sick or I ask but even then I don’t always get to. \n\nI don’t have a ton of free time in general because by the time I get off work most days my husband has already picked up our son so my days basically look like this: wake up at 6:30-7am, get myself and son ready quickly for the day, take him to daycare and be back home (luckily I WFH or I think I’d feel even worse about this) by 8am for work. Then husband gets home around 3pm, takes a minimum 1 hour nap then picks son up around 4:30 or 5. Then I get off work at 4:30 and get to hang with son, feed us dinner and do bath and bedtime which we share bath and bedtime duties.  \n\nMy biggest issues is that I just do not have a lot of free time and definitely not as much as my husband does. So I am asking you, am I the asshole for expecting my husband to get up with our son and take him to daycare and let me sleep in a little on the summer weekdays before I have to work when he is off and has the whole day free since our son will be at daycare and he can do whatever he wants? \n\n\nETA: Husband is not just napping and doing nothing when he’s home for summer and sons at daycare. He is doing house projects, lawn maintenance, fixing cars and other things. \n\nSon loves routine and daycare and him going in the summer works for us at this time so that’s not an issue really even tho I do hear that it would be beneficial for some dad/son time and will talk to him about this. \n\nHe currently has been taking our son to daycare each day but I usually have to ask him specifically to get up with our son when he wakes up rather than him just taking on the responsibility of getting up with son and letting me rest a bit. Although some days I do get up and get him to daycare still. \n\nWe have had variations of this conversation but not currently for this summer so we need to have that convo. \n\nCommunication is a struggle for us and we need to work on that. \n\nThanks for all the valuable feedback. It is truly appreciated. \n\nFinal update: \nThanks everyone for all your support, new perspectives, advice and reflection questions for me. It seems that my husband and I have a lot of work to do to get to a better place in our parenthood. My husband has work to do on his fatherhood and I have work to do on putting my foot down and taking care of myself and calling him higher as a husband and a dad. \n\nWe have at least loosely decided that I will get up with my son about 2 days during my work week and I’ll sleep in on Saturday and he gets Sunday and of course as with any arrangement there’s always room for flexibility depending on different circumstances. \n\nBut again thank you all so much for helping me on this one. I haven’t shown him the post and not sure I will or not but so glad to have all the input in case I decide to show him.\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "This is a different post than from my Ex story I had a while ago (im doing fine, I got a new girlfriend and she is the best.)\n\nSo I (17M), Am a autistic person, I just got hired for a summer job at my communities council.\n\nI was also in the pool of hirees, Along with my friend.  \nThis friend I knew since the 8th grade, since he moved here from toronto.  \nHe was also in the position for the summer job, which only had 4 slots.\n\n  \nSo I got hired on Thursday and took the position, which was my final exam for math, so I remember that day because it was my final exam.\n\n  \nI thought all was well, and I saw that exact friend in the canada day festival my community was holding, so I thought all was well.\n\n  \nThen I took a break so I can get some ice cream cause I was hungry, One of my coworkers was near by me, we were chatting it up.\n\nThen he said \"You know (Person name) Is mad at you for taking the summer job position?\"\n\nSo I was confused so I let him explain.\n\nHe said that he called me the r slur, saying that I didn't deserve the job.\n\nand what the friend said made me know he wasn't even fit for the job either way.\n\nwhen he got hired at the previous year's council, he was late by 30 minutes to work. Everyday. So I knew that he wouldn't get hired because of that.\n\nI got hired cause I had people skills and knew how to communicate with others and I can work with teadious tasks.\n\n  \nBut I may feel like the asshole because I took a job position over someone that I knew had it last year.\n\n  \nSo AITA for taking a position that my friend also applyed for?",

      "scenario_description": "This is on a throwaway because this is so niche and dumb that I don’t want it on my main. \n\nI (23F) have been working at a small restaurant with about 35 staff members total for about 2 years now. I get along great with everyone who works there, except for 1 girl, Mara (19F) who started about 3 months ago. \n\nI do not like this girl. I have tried really hard to like this girl. Mara refuses to do the bare minimum parts of her job (ignores tables, won’t do side work, won’t run food, etc), will cry and break down into hysterical sobbing when asked to do her job, or literally have a foot stomping, item slamming tantrums when the sobbing doesn’t work. She will lie and say that she did do her job, and belligerently sob when you catch her in a lie as she isn’t a very good liar and they’re very easy lies to catch if you just go back and check her work. \n\nAll of the trouble she causes ends up COSTING me money because if I work a shift with her, I’m the one waiting her tables, running refills, etc or else the managers will get cross with me for “not putting the customer first.” I’ve done a spreadsheet and I make less tips on nights I work with her because my tables get slightly more neglected when I’m helping her, while she gets to pocket the full tip from what are technically her tables that I waited on. \n\nMy coworkers thought it would be fun to have a “Christmas in July” potluck like we do for the actual day of Christmas in December and Thanksgiving in November. For both of these things, I made a homemade baked Mac and cheese to bring to the potluck both times. I adore cooking, and I adore sharing my food with friends, who I consider many of my coworkers to be. \n\nI wrote down that I’d be bringing food to the potluck, but when they asked me if I’d be participating in “luau Santa” (it’s just secret Santa in July 🙄) I said no, that I don’t really have the money with it being July and all. We’re not a tourist town and we really slow down during the summer, and I still have 2 pets and my little brother to feed while he’s out for the summer. I made excuse after excuse to not sign up for this part. \n\nMy managers kept asking and asking and asking if that was the real reason, until I finally told them that it’s not just that I don’t have the money, it’s that I don’t want to risk getting paired with Mara and having to buy her something, so I won’t sign up at all. I just can’t justify spending money on her in my head when I know that she already costs me money every time I work with her. My managers think I’m the AH for refusing to play, because we need an even amount of people, I told them to stop bothering me about it or I wouldn’t bring anything at all to the potluck. \n\nAITA?\n\n",
