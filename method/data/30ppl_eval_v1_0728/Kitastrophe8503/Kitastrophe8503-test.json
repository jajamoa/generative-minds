      "scenario_description": "Okay so… I (36M) just got into a little spat with my friend (24F) as we were re-watching GOT. Approaching this conversation Jon snow had just gone north of the wall for the first time and the character “Craster” clearly states that in regard to the Mance Raydar army there’s only one place for them to go… south. But I disagreed. I said “if they went further north then eventually they’d get to the south.” Much like if u were to (in the real world) walk from Nunavut north you would quickly find yourself In South America. Now this is where it got ugly. \n\nMy friend is neurotypical and she calmly attempted to explain that in fact it would not be quick nor easy to travel such depths. The wildlings did not have the resources nor the technology we do here today to make such a journey. But you see, (in the real world) we do have those things that the wildlings don’t. When I disagreed again she said that she doesn’t wanna finish the rest of the show. \n\nI offered to make us some popcorn, because I was starting to feel heated and that maybe we had both overreacted, and I know my friend can get grumpy when she’s hungry. I told her to halt! (Hungry, angry, lonely, tired). I told her she couldn’t be lonely, because she was with me, and so she must be hungry. She didn’t take this the right way at all. She rolled her eyes and started explaining how last year, 500,000 migrants crossed the Darien gap, and how difficult and dangerous the journey is. She *pointed* at me and said that if a 60 mile journey over mountainous rainforest was one of the most dangerous journeys you could attempt, then surely, 1300 miles walking across the frozen wasteland of Nunavut alone, would be nearly impossible. \n\nI screamed back, “nearly!” I caught her in a web of logical fallacies!\n\nI said I didn’t want to fight anymore, and that she should just respect my opinion, and that we might never know the answer. To be clear, this woman is 12 years younger than me, where has she walked? \n\nShe slept over anyways but she only said she’d stay if I agreed to disagree. And I hate that, it doesn’t seem fair. \n\nSo what is it? AITA? ",

      "comment_text": "YTA. You were factually incorrect. When Craster says there's only one way they *can* go, \"can\" requires the way isn't  blocked by certain death. Also, its a work of fiction, not a research paper. I'm sorry you don't understand how language works but that isn't your friend's problem.\n\n\nShe understood the parameters of the question and you did not. You disregarded her intellect by saying she \"must be hungry\". It couldn't possibly be because she was dealing with someone arguing a truly nonsense point and not having the emotional control to accept what he just said was stupid.  You had to dismiss her and accuse her of not being of sound mind because she set a reasonable boundary that you found inconvenient. Try being less emotionally attached to your mistaken idea you're perfectly logical and you won't have to assume people who disagree with you are not making sound arguments. \n\n\nAlso - no means no. She doesn't want to watch with you because you suck the fun out of it. That's it. No. \n\n\nI will not be responding to comments OP makes on this comment because I dont have time in my life to nurse the fragile egos of people who use this delusion of logic to justify their emotional response to being disagreed with.",

      "scenario_description": "31 M and my girlfriend is 28. Her and I have been together for 6 years and have been living together for the last 2. Going to attempt to keep this short so plz ask for details if I leave something out. \n\nGF has always enjoyed doing comedy and has done open mic nights since we’ve met shortly after college. She had a real sales job though that was her Monday-Friday 9-5 job where she made decent money. \n\nI have a good but hard job and make almost triple what my gf was making when she had her job. I said *had* because last August she quit her job because it was taking away from her comedy ventures. She told me a year from now she thinks she can really make it. I was a bit skeptical but since I make enough to support us, I encouraged her because I want to be a supportive boyfriend. \n\nSince she quit her job, she began doing Uber and DoorDash, which is where she makes 100% of her money. Her comedy has gotten us zero dollars. Over the past few months I have started to resent her though. She constantly complains she has no money, yet drives for Uber or DD maybe 3 times a week for maybe 4 hours at a time. I have been paying a lot more for household expenses and I’m not saving as much as I’d like to anymore. She sleeps til noon because sometimes her open mics run real late before she even gets to perform. And when she gets up she just bums around on tiktok and YouTube looking for “inspiration”. She also gets very moody with me if I don’t come to 90% of her open mic performances. Even after working a 14 hour day she will get mad if I don’t go to her open mic at 11 PM on a Tuesday. \n\nLast night, I did the unthinkable. I asked her to consider going back to a full time job. I said she should still do her comedy but I’m struggling with taking care of our expenses all by myself. When she gave a dismissive answer, I told her firmly that she will never be a famous comedian. I said she’s 28 and it’s time to grow the fuck up and join the real world because this is totally unfair to me that I bust my ass while she lives in La La land. And that she can’t be this naive at this age by thinking she’s going to support herself with this. \n\nShe stared at me in silence for a few minutes, started crying and went to stay with a friend. She called me a fucking dickhead asshole and I’m the worst friend ever. She has not answered her phone today yet.  \n\nSo am I a fucking dickhead asshole?\n\n\n\n",

Pretty dismissive. I wonder of this will be a pattern \n\n\n> she just bums around on tiktok and YouTube looking for “inspiration”\n\n\n\"Bums\" sure is dismissive. Doing research before writing jokes is... Pretty standard.\n\n\n> I did the unthinkable\n\n\nYou sure did, but it wasn't asking her to go back to work it was...\n\n\n > I told her firmly that she will never be a famous comedian. I said she’s 28 and it’s time to grow the fuck up and join the real world\n\n\nThere it is. Couldnt be more condescending and dismissive of her if someone was paying you.\n\n\nFWIW - I don't think she should have quit her job until she was making steady money as a performer. Shes been at this almost a year now and if she hasn't brought in any money from comedy, its past time for a conversation about budgets and whether the gig economy os working for her. I think she still needs to be making money and you guys should have had an adult conversation about that. However, even with *all* that, you're still ta for your condescending attitude and the way you spoke to her. \n\n\nI think it is especially telling that you quoted yourself verbatim but you wont say what she said that was so \"dismissive\" it warranted so vicious a response. Next time, communicate with your partner before you get so mad you blow up at her if her response isnt the exact words you wanted to hear.",

She was grounded for using her bike to sneak out at night to meet up with her boyfriend and smoke weed.\n\n Last week, she called me in the afternoon asking if she could borrow my bike later that evening. We’re close friends so I said yes but that id need it by the morning to get to school. The next day she didn’t return my bike and I was late to school, having to catch a later bus as I expected her to swing by and drop off my bike. Three days ago she finally returned the bike with scratches all over it. Obviously i was pissed so i got mad at her, demanding to know why my bike was all scratched considering when i lended it to her it was in good condition. \n\nYesterday morning she texted and called, practically begging to borrow my bike for the coming night, I said no. She insisted on borrowing it again, and when I refused, she stopped answering my texts. \n\nThis morning I woke up to find my bike missing (It’s usually kept by the side of my house behind a gate, the gate doesn’t lock but it’s been like that for a year and a half and we live in a safe neighbourhood). I immediately called her, but she didn’t answer. I caught the bus to school again, once again late.\n\nLater that evening, she still wasn’t answering my messages, so I told my mother. I asked my mum for her parents numbers and told them what she had been doing; sneaking off behind their back, hanging out with her boyfriend and smoking weed. She called me later that night fuming, saying we weren’t friends anymore.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Situation: My gf is losing her mind over this and it seems ridiculous to me. She has been sick for two weeks and was recovering. I offered to take her out to brunch. She slept in past brunch hours so I said ok lets go to this restaurant we wanted to try instead. She says its too far shes still dizzy but she wants to go out. I offer a gelato or fry place nearby. Pick her up and drive there then ask her if she's sure shes hungry, we can get something for later if not. She says only a little lets get gelato. I buy us gelato and she then decides she wants a sandwich at starbucks so I take her there. I gave her a $5 gift card I had to pay and grab a drink which leaves a few dollars leftover she pays. \n\nAfterward we walk around a shopping area for about two hours and I see a seafood place has a pretty good deal for a hot dog, fries and drink for $5. I ask her if she wants anything and she looks at the menu and says no. We then share fries as I get a hot dog. After, I take her to the supermarket to get stuff for later and drop her off as I was very tired and had been up early. \n\nShe melts down the next day saying I promised brunch and lunch then backed out. That I asked her if she was hungry because I had no intention of buying her food. That I forced her to buy my drink. That I didnt buy her anything when she was hungry and ate in front of her. (She never said she was hungry and had eaten twice already and said she wasnt hungry to begin with). The hot dog especially she is making a big deal about that I dont care about her, should have taken her somewhere else, I am so selfish, etc. It's so crazy to me. She said she didnt want anything and it was a good deal. I'm not leaving anything out, this is exactlyvas it went down. I didnt even know she was upset until the next day. AITA?\n\n*Update*\nSome additional context, I lost my corporate job recently and am interviewing for a new one. So I have no income and living off savings until interviews are complete, which you never know if you'll get an offer. So trying to budget spending. She is aware of this and has a job. Regardless, I have never asked her to pay for anything since we started dating a year ago. The gift card I wasn't sure how much was on it, at least $5 so I didn't know if it would be enough to cover everything or not at starbucks. I just got a can of soda I did not expect her to pay if it didn't cover it. It was $3 something leftover and she paid it while I was looking at the other items. I had already spent $15 on gelato plus at least $5 at starbucks. The hot dog place I only stopped at because it was a really good deal and I was hungry because she had chosen gelato over the fry & burger place earlier. The lobster bun items at the hot dog place are $22 a piece which I had offered her if she wanted one and she said no without expressing she was hungry. \n\nI have been taking care of her for three weeks while sick, took her to the doctor and brought her meds, soup, cooked. She wanted to go out that day and walk and wanted to eat out somewhere. The fry place and gelato are newly opened and she had previously said she wanted to visit both. This is why I asked her if she was sure she was hungry or if she wanted to eat something else but this is where she wanted to go. ",

If it was more than $5, that isn't a great look on you.\n\n\nIt seems like... Maybe don't take someone recovering from illness to a fish shack - cuz she isn't going to want anything there - but \"I know I slept late but i was in the mood for brunch\" or \"I'm hungry, but i don't want gelato and hot dogs\" or \"can we brainstorm another option, my stomach isn't quite right, sorry\" are all very easy sentences to say for most people.\n\n\nShe seems to be feeling undervalued or under cared for, but the things she's focusing on seem like weird things to focus on. It sounds more like lashing out based on something else than it does a real reason to be upset ",

      "scenario_description": "I (32F) I’m getting married to my fiancé (35M) Nov. 2025 our wedding is small and intimate (50 people). We are not having a bridal party and have no kids policy except for my teenage sister. \n\nHere’s the dilemma: \nMy fiancé sis.(21 F) is currently pregnant by her now ex(23 M) they started dating in Nov. 2024 & got pregnant not long after. We don’t know where their relationship stands, & it’s never been clearly communicated. The only thing we’ve been told is that they plan to “coparent “which feels vague & doesn’t clarify whether they’re officially together. Based on how it was worded, we’re assuming they are not together. I’ve never met him and I don’t plan to before the wedding. She’s due about 2.5 months before our wedding.\n\nWhen addressing her invite, I asked my fiancé if we should include him as a plus 1. His response was,“Nah, I don’t know him like that so why would we give her a plus 1” so we sent her an invite addressed only to her. \n\nRSVPs go through a Google Form. It’s clearly stated “if you have a plus one, it will be listed on your invite. If not, please leave that section blank.” She submitted her RSVP, entering his name as a plus 1, even though it’s clearly stated.\n\nI could’ve made separate forms for a guest with and without plus one, but that would just delayed the issue. Now we’re dealing w/ it ahead of time and not the week of the wedding. \n\nAdded context: \n- My fiancé‘s brother got married in October 2024. Despite us being together for four+ years, living together and engaged, I wasn’t invited\n- ⁠ my fiancé never brought it up with his brother, mom, or grandma- he’s very conflict adverse. \n- ⁠ well it bothered me at first, I let it go, but to me, it set a tone that in his family significant others don’t automatically get invited, even in long-term, committed relationships. \n\nAdditional thoughts: \n- SIL is 21. While age doesn’t define maturity, the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which governs decision-making and impulse control, doesn’t fully mature until about 25. Some immaturity is expected, especially based on past situations.\n- She’ll be newly postpartum, & emotions, often run high during that stage. \n- My fiancé now says I should “let it slide“ to avoid drama, but that doesn’t sit well with me. Especially after how his family handle our situation last year(brothers wedding invite) \n- I also worry that “letting it slide” set a preced. If she adds a plus 1 that wasn’t offered, what stops others from doing the same? We already have to make cuts, for our invite list, and even one unapproved guest could bump someone we genuinely want there. \n\nSo, AITA for standing my ground and not giving her a plus 1, especially since we’ve never met him, their relationship status is unclear, and he’s just the baby father or should I “let it slide” for the sake of keeping peace?\n\nThis isn’t sitting right with me. I’d love honest feedback. I want to handle this fairly, without bending over backwards for people who haven’t shown us the same courtesy.",

It kinda sounds like you judged their relationship as illegitimate - alarmingly because of her \"undeveloped prefrontal cortex\" - and defined him as a 'baby daddy' without any actual interest in their relationship status. Is it your right as the couple getting married to decide who gets a plus one? Absolutely. Its your guest list. \n\n\nHowever... It's worth actually knowing whether you disinvited the partner of a member of the groom's immediate family cuz you don't wanna treat their relationship as legit or of you headed baby daddy drama off at the pass. Also - is the baby invited?\n(Eta: nta)\n\n\nInfo:\n\nEdit: If the baby is invited, ESH - cuz you invited her baby but not the dad whoul would help her manage the baby at her brother's wedding; unless the venue is extremely limited and everyone else's plus one absolutely has to be there, a plus one is the stand up thing to do for your SIL in that situation.\n\n\nIf the baby is not invited and you did explicitly ask if this man was a plus one type person in her life and still didn't have an answer when you sent invites out, NTA, cuz you don't just add yourself a plus one without talking to the couple.",

      "scenario_description": "My(26M) grandpa(85M) recently got rushed to the hospital after he expirence symptoms related to congestive heart failure. His wife, my stepgrandma (75~F) apparently found out I called the hospital and got in contact with his nurse and then eventually the doctor seeing over his care. Who gave me the updates she was unable or unwilling to provide. \n\nHe is in significantly worse shape than I assumed and I am going to visit him tomorrow. However she is extremely upset that I asked the doctor how much longer he has. He also recently had a stroke among other issues that I dont wish to share. I only called because I didnt want her to feel pressured or feel like she would need to take time away from my grandpa, her husband, to constantly update us on his condition.  She feels like I went behind her back and only wanted this info to spread rumors and start drama\n\nThe nurse in charge had me on hold for a couple minutes before she shared info. As well as his doctor called me directly to share info. I presumed somewhere along there they asked if they could share before they did. I strongly suspect they asked my grandpa if he was okay with them sharing info, and he agreed. Thats my guess. She also wasnt forthcoming with updates as I only called later in the day when we had no new info. I figured she, rightfully and understandably, was more focus on him than updating us.\n\nEither way she is upset, and might prevent me from seeing him potentially for the last time tomorrow due to this. Am I the asshole for potentially going behind her back to gain info on his condition?",

      "scenario_description": "I’ll keep it brief. My roommate and I were watching TV at a standard indoor volume at 11:30pm. Our other roommate comes out and asks us to turn it off completely. We turn it down to literally volume 1 but they wanted it off completely. We also were making no noise with our voices.\n\nThey got upset and stormed back into their room when we turned the volume really low (there is pretty much no background noise so the TV was really quiet but we were still able to hear it - and their room wall stands directly between their room and the TV but still, the TV was super quiet and almost certainly could not be heard through the wall with their room door closed) instead of turning it off completely.\n\nThis is a shared living space. We were in the middle of watching something, and being roommates with someone means compromising.\n\nEDIT FOR ADDED CONTEXT: I appreciate all the level-headed and reasonable replies from both perspectives, and honestly, this pretty much seems like a 60-40 split which, for Reddit, I think is a pretty healthy split! I think it’s worth mentioning that part of my issue here is that this was far from the first time that we watched TV that late. And it was never an issue, at all, ever, for 9 months until last night. Hell Sunday, Monday and Thursday night football meant 3 nights per week I was watching past 11pm during the fall and and they were completely chill with it then, and I would watch it at like volume 7. And it was DURING the school year and they still had to be up at 7am the next morning. The school year is not over which means they no longer need to wake up at 7am every morning for classes.\n\nAITA?",

Its good to be mindful that your perception might be different from the roommate on the other side of the wall. \n\n\nMy roommate (who is , as i type this, asleep on the other side of the living room wall) has a button on her nightstand to turn the volume down on the living room tv, which signals to me that it's too loud for her so i can turn it down to something i can hear without disturbing her.",

      "post_title": "AITA for Asking My Parents to Pay Me Back?",
      "scenario_description": "I (19F) was asked by my parents two years ago to give them a total of $4000. The reason they had asked me was because my mother had recently lost her job at the same time that we had just moved to a pricier house, so it was really bad timing. Just to preface, I was not the only one they asked to borrow money from, they asked for help from my older brothers (22M and 31M) as well. However, because my 22 year old brother didn’t have a job and my 31 year old brother was already moved out and paying his own bills they only borrowed a $1000 from each of them. \n\nWhen they asked me for money I didn’t hesitate at all to say yes because my parents have been really supportive and caring of me and my siblings, and so I wanted to do my best to help them during these tough times. Fast forward to nearly two years later, my mother has found a new job and our financial situation is much more stable. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes: My parents promised they would pay me back as soon as my mother found another job. And they did, they immediately paid $1000 to me and my siblings. So they fully paid off my brothers, while still owing me $3000. In any other situation this would be fine with me, because I understand that they still have expenses and debts to pay. I’m not currently using that money as I am still living with them and am taking out loans for my studies. However, while they still do owe me money, they’ve also started to add a bunch of features and upgrades to the new house. They’ve done things like put grass in our yard, built a patio and shed in the backyard, among other things. And I know for a fact that the cost of these things far surpasses the money they owe me. \n\nBecause of this, I have started to feel anxious because I still haven’t gotten my money back. The money they borrowed was about half of my total money from my first ever part-time job. And now that I am older I have plans to move out and I want to invest that money they owe me.\n\nOne day they told me they had plans to expand our drive way. This was kinda my breaking point and it lead me to bring up the money they owe me, because this was yet another upgrade they didn’t need and would cost a fortune. But when I asked, my parents suddenly got very defensive, and they said that I shouldn’t be acting selfish like this and allowing money to get in the way of family. They also said that because of them, I don’t have to pay rent while I’m studying and working, so this was the least I can do. \n\nI love my parents and they insisted that they’ll pay me back when they can, but I can’t help but feel weird when I see them spending all this money and still not keeping or acknowledging their promise of paying me back sooner. But I’m also starting to have doubts after my conversation with them because it did make me feel like I’m a selfish person who only cares about money. AITA?",

Maybe the approach should be more \"hey, I'm thinking about (life change) soon, i could really use that $3000 now that you guys are in a better place\"",

      "scenario_description": "AITA - My husband (41) and I (41) both work, we live in Silicon Valley. He makes 3x more than I do but I have to work and contribute as much of my income as possible to household expenses. He pays for most things and I am expected to do all the things involving caring for him, the kids, our home, etc. \n\nMy daughter asked for a party at home this year for her (9) birthday. She wanted a sleepover but all her friends' parents said the girls weren't ready for that. So with my husband's advice I planned an evening sleepover themed party. \n\nAs I was planning I came across really cute tepee style tents with air mattresses that I thought would be perfect. My husband was totally against it. He felt like having a party at home should be done cheap. In previous years we've spent anywhere from $500 to $1000 on parties for the kids. The tepees cost $250, and I bought decor for around an additional $100. He demanded I throw them away immediately following the party because he didn't want them piling up in the garage. In total we spent about $500 on her party. The final straw for him was our daughter asking to go to a Disney Concert after we started planning her party and he knew we were going to do it for her. As a result he flipped out.\n\nI responded with a few things: he was being very mean and negative about every part of our daughter's birthday and towards our kids in general, he has had hundreds of dollars worth of large expensive Lego sets sitting in boxES in our dining room UNOPENED for YEARS, and it was a turn off (because he was demanding \"spicy time\" in exchange for getting things for our daughter's party). \n\nThe result, he hasn't spoken to me in days. He's denying giving me the silent treatment, but he's been quiet, moping, and isolating himself. He didn't even speak to or spend time with our daughter on her birthday. He locked himself in our room and had my son bring him drinks and food all night during her party. Now the party is behind us and I know he deliberately did that to avoid having to pay for anything else in hopes the party and something would fail so he could say \"I told you so \". Or prove without  his money we would have nothing and that's why we should be more appreciative of him. \n\nAITAH, but also is what I said and did genuinely being ungrateful of my husband?  ",

My mom and I responded that a 7-day cruise is too long and expensive so she responds with a screenshot of a 5-day cruise with no pricing in the pic. At this point, I am not too excited to see that she wants a cruise wedding, but I didn't say anything negative yet, as I was going to see her that weekend and hopefully bring it up gently then.\n\nThe following days are a follow ups of venue options on and off the boat and the itinerary, until on Friday, she sends a video invitation to the group chat. I ask if that is the final invitation. Alex responds that it is, she was sending it to friends and family already. I figure this is the time to drop the bomb that this is a very expensive wedding for her guests. She responds that its okay, she only wants a small wedding and that people can pay it off in installments. I say \"what about everyone who already has booked vacations, can't take more time off?\" She assures me that 9 months in plenty of time. My mom chimes in that there is no way our elderly grandparents would be able to come as 1 of them is already wheelchair bound. She says that's fine too.\n\nI started to make some suggestions: a small family dinner before the cruise in our home state PA/NJ (cruise takes off from FL), a FL Disney resort wedding before the cruise, a Bahamas Disney resort wedding that we can meet her there, and pushing the date to something later/cheaper. She says this is what she wants, she already booked it, and she apparently has been talking about this with fiance for a while.\n\nSo I made a spreadsheet including the cruise tickets, gratuity, flights, a hotel, transport, and dog sitting prices and it would cost me and my husband around $6000 to attend this wedding. We already had 1 booked vacation before Alex's date and another for a couple months after the date so we would be stretched thin money-wise. It's unlikely my husband has enough vacation days so he would be losing a few days of pay as well. I tell her all these things that would possibly prevent me from going, she says \"If you don’t wanna go I get it\".\n\nAlex talked it up during that weekend we saw each other: it would be fun and like a family vacation. She wasn't going to expect gifts, bachelorette party, mandatory activities on the boat, etc. I just think that she really rushed into choosing the wedding right after getting engaged and didn't care about what I had to say about the matter. My mom has the same concerns, but is going to go regardless of the cost bcs it is her daughter.\n\nWIBTA if I didn't go to my sisters cruise wedding? Even if it was financially possible for me to go?\n\n  \nEDIT: for all the comments that say \"why should she care about your opinion?\": I'm her only sibling and not including this past year, we were quite close, even sharing a room from ages 6-16. I'm not some random cousin or a college friend offering my unsolicited opinion, she shared her 'planning' with me (though I didn't realize it at the time). If she had just sent me the invitation and said it was a done deal, this post wouldn't be here.",

I was always supposed to travel in a few days before everyone to help with preparations and spend time with my parents, brother and his wife as they also live out of state. When we got the news of the service times for our friend, I let my mom know that it was the same day as the shower and we wouldn’t be able to make it. My husband is giving the eulogy. But that I still wanted to come the week before and help her and spend time with them but would leave early so we could attend the funeral. She is mad at me. Told me not to come. That hardly no one was going to be at the baby shower and she’s hurt this was my choice. I spoke to my brother and told him of the situation he said I was making the right decision by going to the funeral. According to my mom, that was just lip service as “what was he supposed to say? The choice was already made.”. And they are all so hurt that we won’t be there. She won’t pick up the phone when I call and I got these details via a few short texts. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I'm an international student studying in the west in a male-dominated field. In one of my upper-year courses, there was only one woman in the class. We were randomly assigned partners for a major group project and I got paired with her.\n\nWhere I’m from, it’s uncommon for men and women to work together unless they’re related or married. I went to an all-boys school, never had a girlfriend, and have no sisters. My parents told me I can act how I want while abroad, and I’m not religious, but I still felt awkward because of how I was raised.\n\nOn top of that, her last name made it clear she was from a different religion that traditionally has tensions with mine. That added to the discomfort, even though I don’t personally care about religion. I was already nervous, this was a tough class that lots of people fail, and while I support women being in STEM, I also worried based on statistical likelihood that she might not be as strong (due to unfair systems not her fault). So I quietly asked the professor and TA to switch partners. He said no and I never brought it up again.\n\nThe project ended up going really well. We got full marks and won second prize in a department competition. We worked great together, and once I got over my awkwardness, I found out she wasn't religious either and we actually had really similar views on a lot of things. We became friends by the end and hung out in summer since we were both around.\n\nRecently she found out I had tried to switch. She asked me and I told her the truth. I tried to explain, but she was upset and said it was sexist and unfair.\n\nI understand why she’s mad, but I’ve changed and learned a lot. I never treated her badly. AITA?\n",

      "scenario_description": "ETA: this was Sunday night. We stayed Saturday-Monday (today). Four hours from my parent’s house. No other rooms were available. It was NOT a party, this was a weekend fishing trip. \n\nI (28F) and my husband (28M) are on vacation visiting my parents out of state with our 1.5 year old son. It is his first big trip with a long plane ride, time difference, and unfamiliar surroundings. Adjusting has been hard, but he is doing his best. I am also early pregnant with our second child.\n\nI try hard not to let my child be an inconvenience to others or expect people to adjust their lives around him. That is especially difficult when we are not home, where he has his toys, snacks, food, and familiar routine. He thrives on structure, and so do I.\n\nThis weekend, we stayed at a friend of my parents’ for some outdoor activities. There were nine adults total and just one toddler, mine.\n\nAt 8:45 p.m., I laid my son down in a pack and play in our room. He fussed a little, so after five minutes I went back to soothe him. By 9 p.m., he was quiet. The room was dark and his sound machine was on.\n\nThis family eats late, and while setting the table, someone began clattering silverware loudly on the countertops. The room we were staying in was directly above the kitchen, which has an open balcony-style ceiling. My son woke up crying around 9:30. I went back upstairs to soothe him.\n\nWhile I was rocking him, someone started playing 80s music downstairs. At first I did not think much of it, but the volume was turned up, and a group of women including my mother started singing and laughing loudly. I texted my husband asking if he could have them turn the music down. He replied, “He is going to be fine.” I said he was not falling asleep and that I was the one in the room. He said, “It is not that loud.”\n\nI cracked the door and realized the speaker was directly below our room. I waited for the song to end so I could lay him down in a quiet moment, but they restarted the same song at full volume and continued singing. I waited for another pause, laid my son down awake, and went downstairs. I calmly said I was turning the music down because it was directly under our room and keeping him from sleeping. Some adults agreed, but others made comments about me ruining the mood. I should add the speaker had been set to maximum volume.\n\nFeeling emotional and frustrated, I gave my husband the monitor and went quietly to the basement to calm down and cry without making a scene. He came down 15 to 20 minutes later and told me I was overreacting. He said our son has slept through louder noises and that I was being unreasonable. I reminded him there is a difference between sleeping through something and trying to fall asleep with it. He dismissed me, said I was not going to change his mind, and left.\n\n5-10 minutes later I came upstairs. One of the homeowners apologized for waking my son, which I appreciated. But the others, many of whom were drunk, made exaggerated jokes about whispering so they would not wake the baby. At that point I decided not to eat and went to bed around 10:15.",

When you're struggling to get you kid to sleep and your husband says some shit like this you tell him he can come up and put him to sleep with the music blasting. Not your problem anymore, tag him in and go enjoy the party. Lets face it, if after 10 minutes he had come down and asked the music be a little quieter, they would have taken his word with a lot less nonsense.\n\n\nRegardless, you shouldn't be dealing with these situations alone, thats why baby human beings take 2 people to create. It gets stressful and emotional fast, so tap out.\n\n\n Not waking babies is just as much about the stress it introduces for the parents as it is about the baby. I get that reddit hates all humans under the age of 18 and thinks no accomodations should ever be made for them, but when you invite someone and their baby over, you have hosting obligations to both.\n\n\nThe home owner - who understands how loud that speaker sounds upstairs - realized, and apologized. So nta. The other guests who were giving you shit probably didn't realize how loud it sounded up where the baby was, or maybe were tipsy or being thoughtless.\n\n\nYour husband, though. Ffs.",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway account here because my husband follows my Reddit.\n\nI (F29) am currently travelling around Europe with my husband (M32). We've planned this trip for a long time and so far it's been everything I could have wanted and more. I have one minor gripe though: my husband reads absolutely everything at every museum or gallery we visit.\n\nWe both appreciate culture and art, and I love immersing myself in a gallery as much as anyone, but my husband takes this to a whole new level. We go to an art gallery and he reads the art labels of every single piece. It's the same if we visit the museum; every single exhibit has to be examined in great detail. I wouldn't mind at all if it was the occasional piece as I do that myself when my interest is piqued, but he reads absolutely everything. I refuse to believe he has a genuine interest in every exhibit or painting, and we end up spending far too long in places, which impacts the rest of our trip.\n\nI mentioned this to him, and he said he just wanted to maximise his enjoyment and immerse himself fully because we'd be unlikely to ever return. Although I told him I would appreciate it if we could hasten, nothing has changed.\n\nAfter spending 4 hours in one gallery where we'd barely even scratched the surface, I said to him that we needed to quicken the pace and read less. Again, he replied that he was soaking it all in; due to my annoyance, I told him he was pretentious and did not have an interest in most of the things he was reading, and it was a means of appearing sophisticated and cultured.\n\nHe called me rude and said that it was as much his trip as it were mine and if I wanted to do something else, I was free to do so. At that stage, I had enough and left the gallery to go and wander around a nearby park. When he'd left the museum around 3 hours later and we ate together, it was strained; he told me I'd been unnecessarily hurtful and he was just appreciating these historic landmarks.\n\nWe apologised to each other but I feel maybe I was harsh. AITA here for calling him pretentious and leaving him?",
