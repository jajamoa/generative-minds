      "scenario_description": "I’m 26F and had been living with a roommate for almost two years. We renewed our lease back in March for another full year. Things were pretty normal, no major drama, we split rent and utilities evenly and mostly did our own thing.\n\nA few weeks ago, my roommate got a new job in another city. Cool, good for them. But they gave me two weeks’ notice that they were moving out and had already spoken to the landlord about getting their name off the lease. No plan, no subletter lined up, nothing. Just “I figured you could cover things for a while until you find someone.”\n\nI told them that wasn’t going to work for me. I didn’t agree to live alone and I definitely can’t afford this place on my own. They brushed it off and basically said I should be supportive of their “big opportunity” and that I’d figure something out.\n\nFast forward to moving day and they asked if I’d help them carry furniture, load the U-Haul, clean, etc. I told them no. I said I didn’t feel right helping out after the way they left me with everything. They got really cold after that and told some of our mutual friends that I was being bitter and making their move more stressful out of spite.\n\nNow some people are saying I should’ve just helped to be the bigger person and that it wouldn’t have killed me to lift a few boxes. Others agree with me and say it was pretty bold of them to expect help after bailing.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to help my roommate move out after they dumped the lease on me?",

The whole concept of being rhe bigger person requires it to be positive in the face of a negative move. You were neutral.

      "scenario_description": "Last night my bf(49) and I(34) got into an argument yesterday because I used a rock he \"thinks\" had precious elements and minerals as a weight for the drain cover while I was giving my son a bath.\n\nHe has a small row of rocks in the bathroom that he collected because he thought they looked cool, which I have no problem with. The rock I'm referring to he said was \"valuable\", even though he never investigated further with it to find out if it was. He started acting like a child, throwing a tantrum because I broke his toy. Saying I destroyed something for no reason. Acting like an ass in front of my 5yo son. He continued to say that I don't care or respect him and that everything he does or says I just completely ignore. That I should have grabbed a rock from outside instead of being lazy and using the closest thing. And I'm mean to him for no reason.\n\nHe expected me to remember a conversation, out of countless conversations we have had in our 2.5 years together, about showing and telling me about the rock. My memory isn't the greatest. If I am told something multiple times eventually it will stick, but if it is only talked about once, chances are I'm going to forget. \n\nHe wanted me to apologize and I refused because I felt he was being disrespectful towards me. Like it was the end of the world. I didn't roll over and beg for forgiveness and let him disrespect me for ruining a rock, which may or may not have had gold or diamonds on it that he never asked a professional about. \n\nIm the bad guy because I didn't like how he was acting towards me, the person he supposedly loves. \n\nEdit: After taking time to calm down, we have calmly discussed and resolved the situation. I have apologized and he knows I am a good person. To the majority of the people here thinking that they know who I am or what my relationship is based on ONE post, all I will say is that my bf knows exactly who I am. I do care. I do have respect for him. I love him deeply. He knows this otherwise we wouldn't be together. \n\nNo relationship is perfect. They take work. Both parties are going to disappoint their partner in some way. We have good and bad days just like everyone else.\n",

You are parents. You are adults. Heck, he's old enough to be a grandpa. Don't argue about which rock you should use to bathe your child, fix your drain.\n\n\n\n\nInfo: was the rock damaged in some way by the bathwater? \n\n\nAlso, less vital, but what is wrong with the drain that a rock needs to be placed on the cover, how long has that been the case and what do you generally use to weigh down the cover? If applicable, why didn't you use that item this time?",

      "scenario_description": "I (23F) live with my 3 roommates Josh (19M), Amy (19F), and Anthony (60-ish??? M). Yes, it is an odd dynamic that I won’t get into.\n\nI rarely come out of my room, I’m an introvert and have really bad anxiety and I tend to feel like a shitty person if I even say one word out of place. Yesterday, however, I decided to come out of my room and interact. Originally when I came out it was just me and one person in the living room when everyone started coming home. Josh had over a mutual friend of ours named Chris (19 M) who I rarely see so I decided to stick around upstairs for a bit.\n\nWhile everyone was in the kitchen cooking Chris and I were on the couch playing a card game and in the middle of it Amy and her bf came home. This was my first time meeting him so he introduced himself and I moved on after the introductions. I’m not really good with people so I was mostly quiet with him. When we finished the game I started getting antsy, not liking how many people were around so I decided to break off into my room.\n\nThis morning Anthony told me I need to cut this “Jealousy” stuff out and stop competing with my other roommates. I didn’t understand what he meant and he explained it. I’m gonna try my best to recap it here. He told me that when Amy’s boyfriend came in I started to get louder and more high pitched and when I stopped getting attention I went back to my room. The only reason I got loud and high pitched was because I was getting into the game and I can get rambunctious without even noticing. He mentioned how both my roommates are in relationships and I’m acting jealous because I’m the only single one and even if I’m doing it subconsciously I need to look within and cut it out.\n\nI have AuDHD (Autism and ADHD) so I get loud when I’m excited and that can mean in or out of a game. I also have a hard time reading but as far as I know Chris and I were just having fun and I wasn’t acting much different. I can recognize when I have changed my tone or if I’m speaking louder than before.\n\nThis is all I can think about today and I can’t help but wonder if I really am doing something wrong. If I really am a bad friend or person. It feels like I’m always doing something wrong or people are misunderstanding me. Idk I just need some clarity or an outside perspective.\n\nSo, AITAH?\n\nTLDR: Roommates think I’m actually jealous over Amy’s bf because I was really loud while playing a card game",

Despite this, we agreed to try and be friends as we are in the same social group.\n\nNearing her birthday in December, I saw that one of our favorite bands were playing locally this coming August. To surprise her, I bought us tickets as a birthday present, they cost around £250 ($335). As you can imagine, this is a lot of money for somebody of my age.\n\nCut to a few days ago, she asked me when i would give her the tickets so that she and her sister could go. I told her that I still wanted to go and didn’t want to give them away. She got very upset at this and hasn’t talked to me since.\n\nShould I still give her the tickets or is there another solution to come up with?",

That's an AH move. You just retroactively didn't give her a birthday present. Once gifted, a gift belongs to the recipient.\n\n\nIn the future, maybe don't buy tickets for future events for partners if youre not prepared for the breakup to precede the event. Most people would just accept that the tickets had already been gifted and moved on.\n\n\nI think she is owed her ticket. Once you gifted it to her it was hers. If you want to go with her, then go with her. If that's awkward, maybe be open to selling her the other ticket and you can use that money towards a different ticket to the same event. \n\n\nYTA a little bit.

She tried calling me to update me on why she could not find it. I was unable to answer my phone because of two things. My phone was currently being used as a method to have people pay at the door.  As well as, the event had already started and I was immediately playing music. I was thankfully able to send an updated text to let her know she did not have to worry about it.\n\nI sent that text around 7:30 PM. My event goes til 10 PM, and she did not show up. She did not tell she was not going to go to my event and she was not busy during the day. When I get home, I apologized to her about sending her on a last-minute fetch quest that stressed her out. She proceed to take my apology and act like I was not suppose to expect her to be there. She has shilled this event just as hard as I have to people. I felt like she was deliberately not apologizing because she went to extreme lengths earlier.\n\nI gave it two days and went to tell her that I was upset that she wasn't at my show. She proceeded to give excuses such as, she doesn't participate in the activity the music facilitated, and that she did not want to be in a loud environment. All while purposely not trying to sound apologetic in any way.\n\nThis is now incredibly awkward because I know for a fact she had every reason to be there. She invited a lot of her friends and people that she knew (who she knew arrived as well). There were spots at the venue where you could be away from the noise. Everyone I know was there to support me, whether or not they participated in the musical activity. I know I shouldn't have put her in a stressful situation before my gig was to happen, which I immediately apologized for. But I don't think it justified not going to my event altogether, and then not feeling apologetic about it.\n\nUPDATE: You guys were right, I was definitely being the asshole. I had a sense of overwhelming support and presence at the event that it blinded me from the fact that it wasn't that personal. I have fully cleared the air with my sister and we are now on healthy terms. Thanks community.",

That class is totally fine as I’m properly enrolled and everything.\n\nBut I’ve also been sitting in on another class at the same college just because I’m really interested in the subject. I’m **not** enrolled in that one, and technically the college rules say you’re not allowed to attend classes you’re not registered for. But it’s kind of an open secret that lots of students do it, and most professors either don’t notice or don’t care. So I figured it was harmless.\n\nThe class is large (maybe 50 people), and I sit in the front row, and I ended up becoming friends with the only other person in front. So I’m pretty visible to the professor.\n\nI sometimes use my phone during class—usually to look things up, but also occasionally just to scroll if the lecture gets slow or repetitive (e.g. when someone asks a stupid question or the professor is going over something I already know). Everyone else is on laptops or iPads, and I didn’t think using a phone was that different.\n\nBut the other day I had to miss class, and my friend told me the professor went on a **3-minute rant** about how phones aren’t allowed in class, how it’s in the syllabus, and how he wants to report the person using one. My friend said it was *definitely* about me because no one else uses a phone and he ranted just when I was gone.\n\nHere’s the thing: I never saw the syllabus because I’m not actually in the class. I didn’t realize phone use was such a big deal. I’m not earning credit or anything, I just wanted to learn.\n\nAITA?",

You clearly have, and thus know its disrespectful to have your devices out and be obviously not paying attention.\n\n\nIf you're doing something thats not allowed and everybody just kinda pretends it isn't happening you have the common courtesy to do it *from the back* you definitely don't make yourself a spectacle while relying on the patience of other people for your own entertainment.\n\n\nAnd if you somehow decide you deserve to take up a space for a student who paid to be there and is getting a grade, you *definitely* don't screw around. You pay attention and be thankful for the space you're rudely taking up.\n\n\nLastly - cuz no I'm not done - you were an ah to the professor who had to try to conduct a class while someone was sitting right in the front row being as disrespectful as she could possibly manage to be. Try to imagine standing in front of 50 people with a presentation intended to inform and also engage and someone right up front is communicating very clearly that you're being boring and they don't care. \n\n\nHave a little more awareness of the other people in the world.",

My mom (65) has a history of not wsshing her hands after using the bathroom \"i didnt touch anything!\" And I (36) have been vocal about my disapproval about this for many years. I try not to do it in a judgy way, but she still takes it as a personal affront.\n\nAnyway.... she has terminal cancer now and basically life sucks hardcore. Radiation, chemo, bone pain, etc.\n\nVisiting her and my dad for a few days now. This evening, i noticed she wheeled out of the bathroom pretty quick (oh, yeah, she's also in a wheelchair now). i didnt say anything. a short while later she outstreched her arms and asked for a hug. I said \"did you wash your hands?\" Aaaaaaaaand she got really upset that i \"didnt want to touch her\" (and no, she did not wash her hands)\n\nMaybe a little hug isn't going to hurt me but i just can't get past the disregard for what i perceive to be bare minimun basic hygiene practice - wash your hands after you use the toilet.\n\nReally, truly, i need to know. Am i an asshole for this? I'm split, honestly. her life really sucks right now and i feel like i should just look past this but also: standards? boundaries?\n\nSigh",

Of course. But she... doesn't. Kinda makes me wonder about when she *does* wash her hands... Like... Did she.. get something on them? Ew. Lol\n\n\nYou can try getting her doctor to stress the importance of periodic hand washing (using the bathroom just happens to happen several times a day and youre right by a sink, why not?) or start handing her hand sanitizer when she comes back from the bathroom, or send her one of those articles or videos about how everything in your bathroom has microscopic poop on it... But I don't know if that will help if she's been doing this her whole life.\n\n\nListen, though. A hug from a Shithand McGee isn't going to hurt you. All the memories you have of refusing to hug your mother when she's ill, of her getting upset at your (arguably reasonable) judgement, the way that is going to strain your relationship rn... Those things will hurt you. It might be worth it to do a little more laundry or lysol yourself to feel better if it means peace with your mother. You're not gonna be on Earth together forever.\n\n\nNAH.",

      "scenario_description": "Edit 3: there have been some helpful suggestions of swapping numbers, suggesting a pad under the treadmill to dampen the noise, and reviewing the lease terms. To those folks who understand the frustration and offered constructive feedback and advice, I appreciate that. Even if they thought I would be TAH, it is nice to have someone actually listen to my frustration and offer useful suggestions. I won't be writing a note, but I will be attempting to talk to him about this issue.\n\nI'm not going to argue with the people who accused me of trying to get him evicted, calling police (didn't do that), expecting him to never make any noise at all (also not what I said) and tried to assume the absolute worst possible thing they could about me. It's honestly wild how this went from a few comments saying they understood why I'm upset but I need to compromise, to accusations of me trying to get him thrown on the streets and expecting everything to revolve around me and being compared to old neighbors who have screaming matches and fight in front of the building (seriously what??) If that's what y'all got from \"my neighbor makes loud noises and shakes my ceiling and it's irritating me\" then I don't know what to tell you.\n\nI won't be responding to this thread anymore as I have gotten actual helpful suggestions and will be trying them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my fiancé live in an apartment building with a LOUD upstairs neighbor. He drags stuff across the floor at weird hours (midnight and later) runs his blender at 6:30 am, and the thing that annoys me the most is he runs on a treadmill at random hours for 30 minutes. This causes our ceiling to shake (I can see window frames and the ceiling fan vibrating with each step.) It also creates a loud thumping noise coming through our ceiling.\n\nI am really irritated by this. Honestly who wouldn't be? I don't particularly enjoy having to listen to stomping on my ceiling. It's especially annoying because I work nights and it wakes me up in between shifts.\n\nI have complained to building management. The property manager came by, heard the noise, recorded it on her phone, and went up to tell him to stop herself.\n\nIt did stop for a short time, but he seems to have moved the treadmill and started doing it again. So now instead of stomping on the ceiling in our front room, the stomping is in our bedroom. \n\nHe was told my management a second time to stop. He asked \"Is there a good time when I can?\" Honestly? No. Even when I'm not sleeping after a shift I don't want to have to hear thumping on my ceiling for 30+ minutes. I'm at the point I am ready to put a note saying \"Stop stomping on our ceiling\" on his door. \n\nMy fiancé says we should talk to him. But I'm pissed, so if I do, I don't think I'll have anything nice to say. My fiancé won't do it himself. \n\nWIBTA if I left a note? I feel like I've already gone through the proper steps with management.\n\nEDIT: I should probably add that it is stipulated in the lease agreement that tenants are not supposed to make excessive noise that disturbs other residents. I think dragging stuff across the floor after midnight and stomping on the ceiling counts. \n\nEDIT 2: General consensus is we should talk to him to work out a compromise. See if he has padding under his treadmill, show him what the noise sounds like because he may be underestimating it, etc. I just need a way to start this conversation because right now I feel irritated. My fiancé is the more diplomatic person between us but he's also very shy and doesn't like confrontation.\n\n-to the people who said \"buy a house.\" I'm not going to pretend that's a good suggestion. If I had the ability to just buy a house to deal with a noisy upstairs neighbors, I would already be living in one and this post wouldn't exist. No, not everyone has the ability to afford just buying a house. Idc if you think I'm TAH that's not a helpful suggestion. \n\n-There also seems to be a misunderstanding that he asked me when he could do this. He did not, and he's made no attempt to talk to me. He asked management if there was a time and they asked me. No other communication has come from them or him.",

      "scenario_description": "Hello just wanting some feedback on my experience and whether I should have handled it differently. \n\nMy husband and I frequent a local restaurant that has a popular bar for dinner.  We saw two open seats at bar but they were on either side of another couple.  I politely asked the lady if they could move to the right or left to open up an additional seat for my husband.  The lady said to her significant other, “they want us to to move down a seat”.   The man said to me, “maybe use the word “please” and I will move”.  I honestly thought he was joking.  I asked him comically, “are you serious?”.  He said yeah i’m serious.  I said, “oh I didn’t think it was that big of a deal”.  He then said, “I can move back you know”.  (as if to control the situation)  psychologically I should have known he was a POS and he must treat his girlfriend like shit.  Not sure if he was trying to prove a control situation in front of his woman.   Literally embarrassed for him.  When their food arrived, the server tried to place the food in front of us, thinking it was them and we quickly corrected the server saying no I’m sorry it’s the people next to us. And then the girlfriend woke up and said they are seat stealers so we’re sitting here now lol. I mean was it that big of a deal that they had to move over one seat I don’t know maybe we were wrong for doing that but if anybody ever asks me to move down a seat so it opens up a seat for their partner I have no issue. It just seems like something so petty to me thoughts? Am I wrong?\n",

You came off as disrespectful to someone who clearly is very much that kind of person. He probably gets prickly when women say \"no problem\" instead of \"you're welcome\". I believe you probably used tone and body language to come off as polite and it didn't come across, so maybe an apology wouldn't have been out of line?\n\n\nHowever, who tf says \"only if you say please\" to not just a fellow adult but a stranger? Its infantalizing. Of course you didn't apologize considering his condescending reaction. Then they follow it up by calling you \"seat stealers\" which just... Is not a phrase you hear coming out an adult's mouth either, for sure.",

      "scenario_description": "My wife and I are on our second child and I am a stay at home father. Before we decided I would stay home we had certain conversations around expectations. I had a fulfilling career and was successful just nowhere near the level of my wife. Our biggest conversation was around sleep and schedules which has recently turned sour. I am over 40, my wife is just over a year out.\n\nOur agreement was I would take everything at night, once the kiddos started their \"cycle\" where their sleep periods were longer until 6 AM which is when she would take over. Meaning night feeds, wake up and crying, everything, and my wife got to sleep so she could work. Recently she has been getting upset that when the baby wakes up just after 6 she has to get up. The baby is now finally starting to get to where he is sleeping 4-6 hours in a stretch. I finally hit a breaking point where I am getting upset after having 3 nights of awful sleep, then the baby woke up at 640 and my wife didn't want to get up. Our first child is in preschool and my wife wanted to sleep in if that kid slept in. I was on 4 hours and 45 minutes of sleep from the night before and less than 6 total the previous two nights. What also gets me upset is that most nights now she is staying up an hour or two later than she normally would, then getting mad at me when I ask her to take the baby after that time period.\n\nMy wife has been increasingly getting angry with me when I tell her its her turn after 6 saying how good I have it. She works from home and this isn't meant to be a bashing post on her. She really is an amazing mother, sometimes between meetings she is able to come say hello to the kids which is awesome, she also exclusively pumps and I handle feeding nights outside that schedule and most of the day, but I need actual sleep. We have tons of 2 cats and a dog, a pond, and a 3000+ sq ft household. I do most all the laundry, almost all the dishes, clean up the house constantly after everyone, and although I don't do the landscaping, I do take care of everything outside as well. I manage the house bills, and keep most of the family schedule. I do a midnight feed every night so the baby can hopefully sleep as long as possible. All that being said, trying to be attentive all day and get all the chores done, there isn't a ton of time to nap, especially considering this kiddos sleep periods are 40-minutes to 90 minutes on average.\n\nI agree I am wildly lucky to even have the setup I have, and have it way better than most, but AITA for wanting my wife to hold herself accountable to our agreed schedule so I can actually get decent sleep?\n\n  \nEDIT: To note, my wife does still pump milk. She can go about 8 hours between her pumps once per day which is normally the wake cycle meaning if she doesn't immediately go to sleep after pumping she isn't going to get a full 8-hours. Sometimes she wakes up to pump then goes back to bed. The rest of the day she pumps every 2-4 hours depending on her schedule. This part should be over at 6-months though. ",

Or maybe you can get a sleep shift after she's off work so that you are getting more sleep before the overnight begins? This doesn't seem sustainable and maybe she's staying up late cuz she's also stressed and unhappy, but there needs to be some accomodation here for the fact humans need rest.",

Shaking a can of nickels every time they go near it? Put foil or plastic wrap on top of the tower? Spray something that tastes gross on the cables? Wrap them in anti pet wrap? Put something more interesting for them to chew/climb/scratch on in the room and reward them for doing that?

Or, better yet, ask your partner to do it cuz thats the owner's responsibility \n\n\nNTA.",

      "scenario_description": "Me and my friend, both male and a little over 21, decided to start playing this mmo that we randomly found. We played well over 4 hours of the game and my friend really enjoyed it so he decided to purchase $100 worth of cosmetics and story expansions. I personally enjoyed it but not to that extent, I dropped $20 but that’s it. \n\nWe played until we ultimately reached level 40 and my friend decided to hop off to sleep. Before calling it a night he messages to me and I Quote “Try not to level to far. We’re gonna level the hell out of tomorrow”. After reading that I decided to not do content that would level me too quickly. I spent the next 3 hours doing low level dungeons and helping other players because that the sort of thing I enjoy. I called it a night and went to sleep soon after.\n\nI woke up the next morning 8 hours later and saw him online playing the game and thought nothing of it, probably sorting out purchases and items or something. But when I hopped on I saw his level and immediately got sick and alt-f4’ed. He was level 96, about 55 levels above where I was. I got really upset and started to chew him out over call. All he could say was “I felt like you were dealing more damage than me so I decided to get stronger, and leveling was a byproduct”. I referred to the text last night that he sent and all he said was, “You didn’t need to get stronger, I did!”. I stopped talking to him up to this morning which is a couple days after the incident.\n\nHe asked me again if I want to hop on, I refused. He called me a baby and said I was wasting his $100 he spent on the game and I should at least help him get his money worth. I told him I’m never touching that game again, and if I did it wouldn’t be with him. \n\nI wouldn’t be this upset if the game had level scaling where the monster scaled with each party members level, they don’t however. If I hopped on we’d only be able to play dungeons my level and he’d decimate everything in his path. “Just ask him to let you get kills so you can level”, knowing him he’d do that until he got bored and would say “It’s taking to long”, and kill everything anyways.\n\nTL;DR Friend spent $100 on game, told me not to level up video game character without him then decided to become 55 levels higher than me in one night because he “felt” weaker, so I stopped playing the game with him.",

      "scenario_description": "I (33F) live with my bf (42M) in his really big (too big imo) really nice house. He pays all of the bills besides my personal bills (phone, insurance, internet, car payment, food, gas, etc) which I pay for myself. I wfh full time and take care of his 4 dogs while he’s at work. I do mostly all of the cooking and cleaning. He does his own laundry, mows the lawn himself (most times) and on occasion will help with dishes or put meat on the grill for me. When I make dinner, I make enough for leftovers so that he will have something to take to work for lunch. I always put it into a container for him and then into the fridge for him to grab and put into a bag and then into his backpack the next morning. According to him, I don’t “pack his lunch for him and I should be”. Am I being lazy and/or inconsiderate by not putting the leftovers in a bag for him and then into his backpack so that he can just grab it and go?",

Is this normal for 25 year old men? Not trying to sound sassy just genuinely curious if men with, a significant other in their mid to late 20s, spend most nights with the boys. \n\nI understand that friend time is important, but he spends all day doing his thing then at night he chooses to spend it with the boys. I’ve truly evaluated my self to make sure I’m no insufferable, and I honestly am not. I’ve given him space, given him more gifts, and tried to surprise him with special things (which did not work). However he still chooses to spend time with his friends. \n\nFor example tonight he came home from a whole day with one of his friends, cuddled with me for 10 minutes tops, and then immediately got on the computer to talk to his other friend. His friend is more clingy and it’s pissing me off. My bf even gives him money to spend at the casino, and for food.\n\nAITA for my bf spending more time with his friends than me?",

      "scenario_description": " I(f) recently turned 20, and as I've done for the past 5 years, I made my own birthday cake.\n\nBaking/cooking for people has always been my love language. It fills me with joy to see people enjoy the things I make them so I cook/bake very often for events.\nMy birthday cake is always my favorite project, I'm a sucker for themes and I have concepts for cakes up to my 28th birthday. It's a very fun creative project.\n\nThis year I made one of those ornate cakes you see on pinterest and wrote \"I beat teen pregnancy\" on it. \nIt took over a month of planning and designing  because I have a pretty packed schedule with work and school but I was very excited.\n\nthe day before my birthday party I spent prepping and planning, then on the day I woke up at 7 and immediately kept on with preparations and I finished it less than an hour before the guests started arriving. \n\nI had only invited a few of my friends, in the end there were 7 guests and me. one of the guests was this girl Cindy (f23, fake name). She's from one of my classes, we just met a few months ago but we're always chit chatting in class and I invited her in hopes of becoming even closer. \n\nThe whole party goes swimmingly; drinks, games, karaoke, snacks, all fun. All throughout I'm super excited about the cake, I can't stop talking about it, I'm sure my friends are only putting up with me because it's my birthday.\nOne of the guys kinda jokingly asks why I'm so excited about it when we're all just sitting around and my bestie jumps in to explain that I'm always like that and how food is my way to show I care. \n\nA few minutes before midnight I bring out the cake. After we sing and I'm about to blow out the candles Cindy grabs a handful of the cake and smears it on my face.\n\nEveryone kinda stared at her and I just looked down and started silently sobbing for some reason. I was so sad and angry and she was laughing. My bestie started screaming at her and I was kinda out of it.\n\nI only heard her say something like \"what's the fuss about some cake\" and I snapped.\nI told her that I worked really hard on that, and It wasn't just some cake it was the hours of effort and dedication behind them that she just smeared and I was excited to share it with my friends. We called eachother names and I kept crying. My boyfriend told her to get out and she said he couldn't do that it wasn't his house, so I kicked her out.\n\nI haven't talked to her since and my friends all say she was in the wrong but I can't help but think she might just nit have known that it was a big deal for me, maybe yo her that prank was a sign of affection and to her I snapped at nothing. I tried to apologize but she texted this long paragraph about me being childish and immature, and how I got my friend's to gang up on her...\n\nI'm starting to feel bad about this so... AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway account! This happened years ago but it popped into my head recently.\n\nI 22f love pranks. Silly stuff like jumping out to scare someone, making up stupid facts or once I convinced my younger siblings on April Fool’s Day that our baby sister had been switched at the hospital and we had to give her back. I never keep it up long. Enough for a lil laugh, then its over.\n\nWhen I moved for college I left behind my Alexa. It has a drop in feature that lets you start a call without anyone having to answer. One night I had the idea to prank my mummy. Shes a light sleeper, was home alone and our house is on a dark isolated hill. Around 11 I started making dumb noises like OoOoh, AaAahh, I’m a ghOooOost. In a ghosty voice or a 'monster' growl. I did this til she found Alexa, said a very tired and angry \"what the fuck Julie\" and unplugged her.\n\nShe called me after pissed, saying she called my stepdaddy (a cop) because she was scared, that the cops came and everyone was taking it super seriously and I should expect a call later. I was scared shitless, then she said that was a prank back on me. We laughed about it later but I did really scare her at the time.\n\nA year later my aunty was staying at our new house in a well lit populated area. She was alone for the night with our dog and had never stayed there before. Shes a scaredy cat, endearingly so. Hates being alone at night, wont do things she knows will trigger her anxiety, known for over the top reactions to scary things like movies and has even cried on Disney rides. At the time I didnt realize how serious her anxiety was and pulled the same prank on on her.\n\nLate at night I did the same routine. “RaAhH” “BoOoOgie oogie oogie” “I’m a moOonsterr” and making deep, pig snort noises. I heard her going \"oh my God\", cursing and trying to goad my dog to investigate and protect her (which he did) sounding scared and a little emotional. When she found Alexa I laughed said it was me and hung up. She called right after pretty pissed, said it wasnt funny, she was gonna get me back etc. The call ended lightheartedly and I didnt think much of it.\n\nLater hearing her retelling made me feel awful. She was terrified enough to call her boyfriend for support who was abroad at the time, barely slept the rest of the night and turned on every single light. It messed her up more than I realized. We all eventually laughed about it but I know she thought it was fucked up.\n\nShe got me back on a trip to Toronto where she lives. She spread a rumor in the family that she planned to get everyone to ditch me on the subway. When I asked her she gave me this eerie nonchalant look and said nothing. Im from a small Caribbean country and had zero clue how to use the subway so that wouldve been really fucked lmao. I spent the whole trip paranoid. I still dont know if she actually wouldve done it.\n\nIve never pulled a prank like that again. At the time, it didnt feel too serious. Looking back, I wonder how evil it really was. AITA?",

You did it once and your mom's reaction should've taught you that it was a stupid thing to do because for a brief moment you believed she'd been scared and had reacted like a scared person would. You knew right then there were potentially negative consequences for this action.\n\n\nThen, instead of growing as a person and recognizing that pranks aren't funny to anybody but the person pulling them, you ...did it again? This time to a visitor who didn't know your house and probably isn't used to Alexas talking in the middle of the night?\n\n\nThat's messed up. Other people have feelings. ",

It was clear they were interested in each other from their behavior during the party, so I wasn't surprised.\n\nI love my daughter more than anything and want her to be happy. She deserves to be happy.\n\nI went over there when they were planning the date and said, kinda joking, that Logan (my friends son) wasn't right for my daughter, so he can get that idea out of his head.\n\nThey asked why. I said Logan was only 22 and my daughter is 25. She needs someone who is financially stable and he's still starting off. I joked maybe in 5 years, but right now he's just a kid. She needs a man.\n\nHe laughed and said he understood, no hard feelings. He knows I just want the best for my kid. I said he was a sweet kid, but not the person for my daughter.\n\nI didn't realize she was mad at me till we drove home. She gave me the silent treatment and then didn't talk to me for the rest of the weekend, saying that I ruined her date and embarrassed her.\n\nAITA here? I was just looking out for her.

We woke her up and asked if she was coming and she said no. We then get a text about 30mins later saying “next time there’s a situation like this I would appreciate if you didn’t wake me up 5 minutes before we are supposed to leave.” (Keep in mind we all had just woken up from our nap as well at the same time as her. All wearing jeans with no makeup. Just going for a casual dinner after a long day of exploring.) Then today, we overheard her telling other students that WE are the assholes!!!  She is an adult and should have better time management, right?? ",

      "scenario_description": "I (24F) have a friend (24M) who has recently started seeing a girl — we’ll call him Joe and her Sarah. Joe and I are very close although we only became friends at the beginning of this year, and he has said he considers me one of his best friends. I know he has mentioned me to Sarah a lot because of how close we are, and as their relationship has progressed from ‘casual’ to something more serious, both of them have been keen for me to hang out with them and get close with her.\n\nThe problem is, I’m not keen to spend time with her. I’ve only met her once, but I spent pretty much the whole day with her and Joe (from 11am to 10pm) so I can confidently assert that she and I have nothing in common other than Joe. Trying to have a conversation was difficult because we don’t even like the same books, or movies, or music, and I didn’t feel engaged in our conversations - I considered leaving early at one point because I just wasn’t that interested in hanging out any longer. She is really nice and really smart, but I don’t see myself ever developing a friendship with her and I would rather spend my time on relationships that are more worthwhile to me.\n\nThis has started to become a bigger issue because when I try to make plans with Joe, or he proposes plans with me, he will invite Sarah without telling me. I’m hosting a small get-together for close friends (max 5 people) at my apartment this weekend, and he invited her to my home without telling me — I found out today, and he said that he can’t take the invitation back because it will really upset her and hurt her feelings if she’s uninvited. I feel like maybe I’m overreacting by being so mad about this, because it makes sense that she would want to get to know me better — and especially because we’re both women, my not wanting to hang out with her feels catty. I don’t want her to think I’m being a pick-me or a possessive ‘girl best friend,’ and I worry that’s how I’m behaving. \n\nHowever, I also feel that I have a right to know who I’ll be spending time with before I agree to a plan, because I should be allowed to walk away from events and situations where people I don’t feel like spending time with are there — and I certainly have a right to say who comes in my home and who doesn’t. I also feel that it’s wrong of Joe to put me in a position of looking like a villain for saying ‘no.’ So reddit, am I the asshole for refusing to hang out with my friend’s girlfriend because I don't want to be her friend?",

Children pick their friends based on liking the same movie. Social compatibility as you mature is about character similarities. Saying you couldn't hold a conversation with a nice, smart person indicates you might be missing the point or possibly the requisite skill. \n\n\n2. Your friend wants you to be friends with this girl. If you don't see the value in investing in this relationship you are saying you don't see value in investing in your relationship with him.\n\n\n3. If you invite someone in a relationship to a get together, you should probably specify that, due to space/nature of event this invitation is only for one. It is generally assumed that couples attend group events together.\n\n\n4. You cannot tell someone you wanna see them but not their girlfriend - especially if its cuz you don't wanna talk to or be friends with her - without just publicly and actively disliking and excluding her. You need to make peace with that. You can't pretend this is a blameless situation you're in, its an action you're taking.You're making the choice to not invest in a friendship with a girl in your social circle. \n\n\nYTA. You don't like this girl and are being unwelcoming to her for petty reasons. You are creating drama around a nice, smart girl who wants to integrate into your friend group. ",

      "scenario_description": "To clarify, I believe I am AN asshole in this situation, not THE overall asshole. Anyways, story time.\n\nI (M18) have been home with my mom and sister (F20) for the summer for a few days now. The situation started when I went to grab some food from the fridge, and saw my sister making herself ice cream. She'd decked it out with chocolate syrup and whipped cream, and I thought it was funny how much was on there. I snorted after seeing it, and she smirked. She then stared at me a little, so thinking she expected me to say something, I said \"there's like 7 grams of sugar per bite.\" \n\nI meant this jokingly since I thought she was in a good mood, but she promptly said she didn't want to eat it anymore, chucked it into the trash, and stormed out of the living room to her room. My sister had struggled in the past with her image and thinking she weighed a lot, so obviously this struck a nerve. I was initially upset since I didn't intend it to be an insult at all, just a joking comment, but after reflecting on it, I realized that I was in the wrong there since I am still responsible for what I say in the end.\n\nI planned to try and civilly discuss the matter with her. My goal was to apologize as well as ask her to make an effort to talk conflicts like this out in the future, as I believed she'd overreacted by locked herself in her room for over 2 hours. When I did come to talk, she said to leave her alone. I told her dinner would be done in 15 minutes as well, and she yelled to leave her alone again.\n\nI was annoyed but left her alone and ate dinner with my mom. An hour later, my sister comes down, still upset, and acts like nothing happened. I went with it and acted normal so that she'd hopefully calm down and be willing to talk. Eventually my mom asks her to talk with me and she refuses. I dropped the conflict for the rest of the day at this point. I believed this conflict was bad, but not worthy of this reaction, and could have been settled with less anger on both of our sides if she'd just communicate civilly.\n\nThe next morning, I left home and came back in the afternoon. As soon as I came back, my sister stops me and tells me that she's an adult and can put whatever she can in her body, as well as telling me how awful it is to shame people like that. I apologized by saying that I understood what I did was wrong and am definitely at fault. Then I asked she could work on her communication though, since I thought her refusing to talk for over 3 hours was overkill . She immediately scoffed and said 3 hours is nothing, and that she was considering doing this for a few months, so I was lucky. Then she promptly turned back to the show she was watching. I was in disbelief, so I stepped back to think things through.\n\nI do think she was justified in being angry, but I don't believe the scale of the conflict, being a single unintentional insult, was worthy of this level of reaction and lack of communication. That's just me though. What do you guys think? AITA?",

Both of them are married with kids, while I’m single and child-free (not by choice, just dating sucks). We’ve only managed to hang out four times this year, which honestly doesn’t really bother me—I get that life is busy.\n\nBut here’s the thing: I see on Instagram and Snapchat that their husbands regularly make time to hang out with their own friends. Meanwhile, my friends are usually the ones staying home with the kids. Also, my two friends live in the same small city (I live nearby too), and it’s pretty obvious they hang out with each other and with their husbands way more often. I don’t mind that either, but it does make it feel like I’m the one who’s left out.\n\nAnyway, one of my friends (let’s call her Friend A) is now pregnant with her second child, which I’m genuinely happy about. The other (Friend B) is starting a master’s program and taking another degree at the same time. When we last hung out, Friend B said, “This probably means we won’t be seeing each other as much anymore.”\n\nWithout really thinking, I just replied, “Well, it’s not like we’ve been hanging out that much anyway.”\n\nThey both went quiet after that and told me that’s not true. I pointed out that the last time we met was in April and that we’ve only seen each other four times this whole year. They told me I should just ask them to hang out more, but honestly, I feel like I’ve been the one initiating most of our meetups already.\n\nSo, AITA for saying that?\n",

      "comment_text": "> I see on Instagram and Snapchat that their husbands regularly make time to hang out with their own friends. \n\n\nWhaaat? Their husbands have more free time than them? When they have small kids? Crazy. They are the first parents that has ever happened to, surely. \nDoes that really sound like something you should hold against them?\n\n\n\n\n>it’s pretty obvious they hang out with each other and with their husbands way more often. \n\n\nThey see their husbands more often than they see you? Checks out. They are friends around the same age both married with small children? Sounds like they have things in common you may not relate to.\n\n\nYou seem to be jealous that your friends are friends with each other. Maybe it would help to be thankful your friends have a support system and enjoy a relationship with one another. We should all be happy to know our friends have fulfilling relationships with multiple people. It doesn't sound like you're terribly involved with the kids, maybe your friends are a little more helpful in that arena for one another?\n\n\nHere's where my problem is, though : your story isn't consistent. Did you say what you said in the title? Or what you said in the post? Cuz if you said what you said in the title, yta to your friends. If you didn't and you just wrote a clickbait title yta to us, but not necessarily to your friends. \n\n\nSaying \"our friendship is almost over cuz you guys don't hang out with me enough\" is childish, self centered, and manipulative. its threatening to cut someone off cuz they're (checks notes) busy parenting their young child. \n\n\nIf that isn't what you said, it is fair to bring up that you don't feel like you're seeing each other enough or that you feel like you're putting in all the effort. Fwiw, Semi-Quarterly hangs isn't even that sparse for adults? With lives? I have friends i haven't seen in a decade and just meet up with on a random Saturday cuz we're both in the same city. I haven't seen my best friend in almost a year. Time passes. Shit happens.\n\n\nIt might be worth it to view this not as your friends expecting you to put in all the effort, but rather you being the friend with the resources to take up the planning responsibilities til the kids are a little older. Presumably, you will one day be married with small children and your friends with their preteens will be the ones chasing you about next month's hang. This is what we do in friendships. We carry loads together.\n\n\nSidenote: \"childfree\" isn't the best word for you, its probably \"childless\" or just \"i don't have kids\". Childfree has kinda become the term that people who have chosen to never have kids identify with. Completely irrelevant, its just shorter than saying \"childfree (but not by choice)\"",

      "scenario_description": "My husband has long hair, about down to his waist.  Last night he attended a birthday party and there was a fire pit.  He came home and showered but it was not wash day so he didn’t wash his hair before he climbed into bed.  I could smell the smoke from the fire on his hair and asked him to wash it.  I explained that it would make the pillows smell and also make it difficult for me to sleep.  He refused and I got upset and left the bed to sleep in the guest room.  I am making him launder the pillows this morning.  He thinks I am making a big deal of nothing.  I think it was very gross of him and inconsiderate not to wash the smoke smell out of his hair.  AITA? \n\nEdit: I should clarify that I did not go to the party.  I stayed home with the kids so he could go to the party.  Part of the reason I was “upset” last night was because I was already in bed asleep and he woke me up with the campfire smelling hair and then I was the one who had to move. \n\nAlso,  the pillows are now washed as is his hair and we are over it.  Some of you in the comments are very dramatic. ",

This is a class that is made to stress safety and not stress competitive sports \n\nMy (24F) daughter (4F) goes to her grandparents house everyday that she’s with her dad so they can watch her to babysit while her dad works \n\nThey put arm floaties and goggles on her when she gets in the pool and watch her from outside the pool.\n\nI told them to stop putting them on her, because she is in swim classes and it causes delays and regressions in her skills and causes her to swim with unnatural skills. They told me it’s okay, it’s safer and they feel more comfortable having her in the pool that way.\n\nI told them I take her to swim every week, and I see her regressing and struggling to be comfortable in the pool now without floaties or goggles when she normally is a very strong swimmer for her age and I’m not really asking. Her swimming instructor also agreed that using these can cause a regression in her swimming skills.\n\nShe said they don’t get in the pool and reiterated they feel more comfortable when she has these things with her, I said they should be in the pool with her regardless and either they can do that or I’d prefer her not to be in their pool unless she can be free in the pool with no goggles or floaties and she’ll have to wait until I or her father can be in the pool with her. \n\nThey said I’m being unreasonable and that they will put her in the pool and I’m being unfair and they’re just trying to be safe. I said they’re going to cause safety issues in the long run if she finds herself in a position where she falls in a pool or something similar and can’t get herself out because her skills have regressed. They’re calling me over dramatic, and her father is getting mad at me as well. AITA?\n\n*ETA: corrected my first sentence that says she goes there to babysit lol",

Do you have a custody agreement that stipulates you're allowed to make demands about what happens on his parenting time? Cuz this seems to be in his court.\n\n\n\n> it’s safer and they feel more comfortable having her in the pool that way.\n\n\n>She said they don’t get in the pool and reiterated they feel more comfortable when she has these things with her,\n\n\nYour kid is better off making slightly slower progress in her swim class than she is drowning in Grandma's pool. Priorities. The adults involved don't feel confident in their lifeguard abilities. Maybe they're not strong swimmers and they wouldn't trust their grandchild's life to their back stroke. Maybe they don't have the energy to be paddling around in a pool woth their eyes trained on a child. \n\n\nAlso, she's FOUR,  even a very good 4 year old swimmer who's still in the middle of learning really shouldn't be relying exclusively on her own ability to swim \"properly\" to stave off drowning. floaties or a life vest of some description can give her the safety net she needs while grandpa rushes over from the side. I don't know that she would be safer if an adult were in the pool. There's a reason lifeguards watch from.the side. Being involved in the activity might make them more likely to miss drowning signs.\n\n\nAlso, your kid's swim instructor does not get a vote here. Her not being the best swimmer in her swim class is orders of magnitude less important than her safety. If shes forgetting form, you can practice that with her. There are lots of different kinds of swimming and Grandma's pool is for fun.\n\n\nYTA a little bit. Unclench and learn to trust that your child's family loves her and is looking out for her safety. If you honestly think they're unsafe people, that's one thing, but this seems more like you wanna control too many things and are waaay to invested in how your kid does in swim class",

      "scenario_description": "Okay so I've been with my girlfriend for about 3.5 years now. From the outside looking in I cannot fathom how someone could misinterpret whether or not we were together. With that said during June and July I was in jail. While I was gone a friend(m) of hers that she had fell out of contact with questioned the status of our relationship. Innocent enough except I was present every time they saw each other before I got locked up after they reconnected. One specific instance that caused me to react as I did was that during a conversation about how her and I like to spend our time together and ways that we could include him and in the future if he finds a girlfriend how we could turn into a couples thing. he had made a comment about how those are all nice things to do but he'd be happy with just having someone to cuddle with. This wasn't a statement directed at my girlfriend just a general observation but she laughed and responded with something like \"well I can't really help with that\" while motioning towards me. So at this point our general behavior, and now a rather clear \"hey I'm taken\" have most definitely established our relationship status. If there was any question at this point, ask. However he waits until I'm locked up and for all intents and purposes, out of the picture to approach her and ask what's going on between us. When I get home I find out about this only because her mom made comments that made me uncomfortable indicating that these two had possibly been intimate because of all the time they spent together while I was gone. So I questioned it in as delicate a manner as possible trying to not outright accuse her of cheating but still wondering. She informed me that nothing happened but he did question our status. I initially got a little upset just because I was fairly confident it was clear we were together. Cue the excuses of well a lot of people break up when one of them goes to jail, and \"I have a really bad memory.\" I'm sorry but no. Don't make excuses for it. Just own up to the fact that you over stepped and be a man about it. Because now your just being disrespectful. \n\nTldr# My girlfriend and I of 3 years fought over a male friend of hers who knew full well she was taken waited until I was locked up and then questioned our status in an effort to try and sleep with her. And then made lame excuses when confronted instead of just owning it and admitting fault.",

Don't make excuses for it. \n\n\nThese aren't excuses. They're valid reasons to ask a fairly benign question. You assumed this guy picked up some implied or passive vibe. You thought it was obvious. You were wrong. He asked a clarifiying question and came straight at the situation - like a fully grown man does. Someone else asking if you guys are dating or not is not something to get angry about. Its a question. You sound like such a crybaby rn.\n\n\n> Just own up to the fact that you over stepped and be a man about it. \n\n\n\n\nYou are overstepping. Maybe own up to getting your panties in a twist cuz someone asked your girlfriend a question. \n\n\n> Because now your just being disrespectful.\n\n\nSomeone sure is being disrespectful, but its not the guy who asked his friend if she was still seeing that guy she seemed to have been seeing before he went to jail.\n\n\nYTA. Kinda hope the next guy she meets is a little more secure in his relationship and masculinity. Dealing with your weirdly dramatic attitude about this sounds so exhausting.",

      "scenario_description": "My gf has a really bad sense of smell but whenever she comes home she always says that the house smells \"weird.\" I ask her what she means by that but she can't explain it. She says, \"It's not bad, it's just weird.\" So she frequently buys scented oil diffusers and places them around the apartment.\n\nOne month, I started getting headaches and dizzy spells and I wondered if it was because of the diffusers laid around the house so I googled it and discovered they can sometimes cause these side effects in some individuals. Turns out they aren't so great for our health and even small pets are known to get sick or even die when exposed to them for long. Once I learned that, I asked her to stop placing them around the apartment but she didn't like that idea. She said they smell good to her, even though she can't really smell them too strongly and that they're like a decoration to her.\n\nI tried emphasizing that I felt strongly that I felt like they may be causing my discomfort. After some back and forth, she eventually caved and threw them away.\n\nFast forward a few months and she's bought more of them and placed them around the house again. I just noticed today that I was smelling something that smelled like acetone or nail polish remover and we figured out the source of the smell was a diffuser she placed in the hallway. She said that she had placed a few of them around and that I wasn't noticing them right away so she thought it wasn't a problem.\n\nI don't know how to handle this situation as it's gotten really awkward because she doesn't want to get rid of them. She's really not stubborn about this sort of stuff usually but with these diffusers she's upset that I keep asking her to get rid of them for our potential health and my comfort. She says she doesn't care about her own health and isn't convinced that it's really effecting me like I say it could be. She tends to think in absolutes which makes it hard to convince her since I can't prove that the diffusers are the cause of my feeling a little sick when I'm in the apartment at times.",

Lol.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that you saying your symptoms are definitely caused by diffusers because somebody on the Internet said it can happen to some small percentage of people is... Flimsy reasoning at best. All sorts of anti scientific things have been pushed because someone alleges some constellation of unrelated and vague symptoms are definitely caused by X. That's why all those kindergartners in Texas have measles rn. \n\n\nGo to a doctor. If the doctor says that diffusers caused your problems, you've got your solid ground. In the meantime find out why your home smells and do something about it.\n\n\nNAH.",

      "scenario_description": "I (27f) got married to my husband (28m) last April. We sent our wedding invites out a full year before our wedding and sent reminders 6 months before. \n\nMy l my brother Jacob (22m) is the youngest of 4 kids (3 girls and one boy), and my parents have always treated him like their precious gold child who can do no wrong. \n\nAs adults this has caused a lot of tension between us. He acts like a raging hormonal 16 year old boy. It’s definitely gotten worse with his fiancé Kelly (21f) enabling his bad behavior. \n\nKelly is constantly telling him we don’t appreciate him and we should be grateful to have him as a sibling. My parents think me and my sisters don’t “understand” him and we don’t give him enough “grace”\n\nJacob told me a week before my wedding he wasn’t coming because he was going to be busy with Kelly and they were going on vacation. I begged him to come and emphasized how important it was to me he came to my wedding. My mom got involved at this point and assured me he would be there and not to worry. \n\nI didn’t find out until an hour before I walked down the aisle he wasn’t there and didn’t intend to be. I was devastated my sisters and husband had to calm me down. I had my heart set on my entire family coming and he was our ring bearer.\n\nWhen Jacob told our family him and Kelly were engaged I was happy for him. He announced his wedding date was May 30th of this year. He emphasized we all HAVE to be there. His fiancé sent a text saying that our attendance was MANDATORY. \n\nI’ve been debating skipping his wedding. I don’t get along well with Kelly and my brother skipped my wedding. I mentioned possibly not going to my mom and she was pissed and told everyone. \n\nNow my brother, Kelly, and my parents are calling me an asshole, brat, and petty for maybe skipping his wedding. My sisters and husband agree with me I don’t have to go since they didn’t go to mine. But idk would I be the asshole for skipping my brothers wedding?\n\nMinor update: turns out my husband isn’t invited and my oldest sisters wife isn’t invited either. Kelly doesn’t want any spouses there since those are in her words “temporary” and she doesn’t want them in any pictures. My oldest sister has decided not to attend because of that reason. (I found this out 5ish minutes after I posted) ",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (26f) got married last month and I (29f) thought everything went ok. She had a beautiful venue, but I thought her wedding was a bit trashy.\n\nHer dress was beautiful if cheap. It was a midi dress with off the shoulder sleeves. I advised her to cover her arms because she’s got a “patchwork” tattoo sleeve on her left arm and I asked her if she really wanted a mouse in a party hat or a cowboy cat in her wedding photos. To which she said, “I think it’ll look sick as hell.”\n\nShe looked beautiful on her wedding day aside from her tattoos and the bit of rodent pee she got on her dress from when she insisted on taking pictures with her “babies”.\n\nThen for the reception she ordered pizza and had a Walmart sheet cake. Why? So she could spend money on a bounce house and ballpit.\n\nI thought the worst part of her wedding was that she didn’t allow kids to come to save money and because in her words “kids can be attention whores”. So I had to pay $100 for a sitter in addition to the $200 I gave them as a wedding gift.\n\nAt the end of the night, she and a bunch of party guests ended up jumping into the pool at her hotel because she “thought it would be fun” and bribed the night manager at the hotel to open the pool again so they could swim for a bit which I thought was rude. So her wedding dress and her husband’s suit was ruined from that.\n\nYesterday, we were going through the photos and she said that she had the time of her life and everything went perfect. I mentioned that I thought it was a bit immature and she said I was just a stick in the mud and if I could let loose for 5 minutes, I could’ve had fun too. I tried to show her where I was coming from but her husband stepped in and said if I didn’t have anything nice to say, I shouldn’t say anything at all and that even his 5th grade students knew that. I didn’t say anything else about it but what she said still kinda hurts.\n\nAITA for saying that I though my sisters wedding was immature and trashy?",
