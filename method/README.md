```

## Overview

The `method/` directory is organized into three main components:

- **`data/`**: Contains source datasets
- **`graph_reconstruction/`**: Algorithms and methods for reconstructing causal graphs
- **`motif_library/`**: Components for motif extraction and library construction

## Status

This methodology framework is currently under active development. Components may be incomplete or subject to change.
