      "scenario_description": "My boyfriend and I met online a few years ago. We’ve been dating for over a year, long distance the whole time. He’s flown out to meet me multiple times though.\n\nA few months ago he invited me to this family thing that would require flying. I said yes because at the time it sounded exciting, and I would get to see the beach for the first time and meet my boyfriend’s family, who according to him, are very excited to meet me. After I said yes he told all his family about me coming and apparently family that doesn’t usually come planned to come just to see me.\n\nHowever a couple months ago I had a shift in my mood and I became irritable, impatient, defensive, etc. I don’t know why but it’s been interfering with my relationships and I’ve been arguing with the people I love more often. I’ve seen my doctor and told her about this and we’ve tried multiple things like increasing my antidepressant medication dosage and taking birth control for the hormone benefits, but so far I haven’t seen any improvements.\n\nSince my mental health took a turn for the worst, I told my boyfriend I wasn’t sure how I felt about traveling right now, since it would involve me being hundreds of miles away from my support system (my family) that I depend on because of my social anxiety, high anxiety, and possible autism. I felt like this was appropriate to do since he hasn’t booked anything yet. I’ve never been so far away from my family before and I’ve never flown in a plane before, both aspects are intimidating, and not something I’m ready to challenge alone.\n\nHe was very angry by this, saying that I would make him look like a fool to his family that he’s told all about me and me coming. Which I understand, but I think he was overreacting a little and also disrespecting my boundaries by making me the spotlight of attention for this event when he knows I have bad social anxiety. While I’m sure they’d be disappointed by me not coming, they’d be happy either way because they’d have each other, and it’s not like they planned the whole thing just to see me, it’s an event they plan annually. I told him this and he insisted that if I changed my mind about going, it would be a “punch in the gut to our relationship” and he said I was in the wrong here, AITA?\n",

      "scenario_description": "For context, I (18F) have never gotten long with my step dad (57M), we’ve barely gotten along since my bio dad passed away. My mom (53F) has been married to SD since 2020 \n\nRecently my SD has been causing more issues with me. I asked him to shut the door because I was holding two dogs. I had my puppy between my legs and I was holding my mom’s 159lbs saint bernard with his collar so they wouldn’t run outside. He looked at me and rudely said “calm down” when I asked him nicely to shut the door.\n\nThe next day (yesterday) I came home with ice cream, I bought myself ice cream as a treat to reward myself because I’ve been cutting wheat out of my diet. As soon as I walked into the kitchen, he expected me to share my ice cream. He said “you brought home goodies and you won’t even share?” meanwhile he had his own ice cream in the freezer, along with many desserts on the counter. I also spent my own money on the ice cream so I didn’t \nfeel a reason to share.\n\nI went to my mom because I was annoyed and she was in the kitchen when it happened. She told me “you’ve been rude to him lately” when I haven’t been rude to him at all and any of my “rude” behavior was me calling him out for being rude to me. She told me how I need to treat him better and stop being rude to him.\n\nToday, I walked inside after my mom told me that a package came for us. My SD brought the box inside and decided to open the box so I could get my stuff. He looked at me and said “that’s mine” even thought he knew the box had stuff for me and my mom in it. My mom told him that he could go through her stuff and take anything he wanted but to not take any of my stuff. I decided to texted my mom and complained once again about his behavior because his words were unnecessary but instead she said I was being rude.\n\nMy last straw was when I found him in my snack drawer, I have my own drawer of snacks as I avoid wheat due to having a wheat allergy. My snacks are gluten free, which in the only one in the house who has a reason to eat gluten free snacks. I called him out as my mom has told him multiple times to stay away from my snacks and that snacks for everyone else are in the drawer below.\n\nAm I the asshole for calling my step dad out after catching him trying to steal my snacks after 3 situations of him being rude to me?",

He's really into the roleplay aspect so that's fun.\n\nAnyway, the other day we were at a pub for his 20th because what else is there to do? Especially in a heatwave, well fucking ridiculous over here. Aside from the point but we're hanging out, I was sober because I drove and I was just drinking lemonade.\n\nBasically a girl comes up to my “john” and starts talking to him, flirting with him, whatever. It was getting l8 so I went up and i was like “Dude it's like 12, i have to be up pretty early, unless you want to get a taxi, i wanna leave soon” he's perfectly chill about it. Tells me he'll just finish his drink.\n\nWhile he's finishing his drink i noticed the girl has like a D&D pin on her bag so i started talking to her about it, asked her what class she likes, if she dms, whatever. Said “john” is really into the roleplay aspect and it's great to know people like that because people don't really roleplay in it anymore or something.“John” started to look mad annoyed but I thought he was just drunk.\n\nA few minutes l8r i asked like “Hey, are you looking for any campaigns in the area? We're thinking of starting a new one pretty soon and we're always open to a bigger group” she said it sounded cool and asked for my whatsapp so she could ask about it later. I didn't think it was a big deal, i kinda nerded out on the poor lass but she seemed fine.\n\nIn the car “John” started going off on one, talking about how I was trying to steal the one girl he had a chance with by embarrassing him and making him sound stupid and “r****ded” when i know his last girlfriend passed away and started saying I'm negative energy because i take away the people he loves. I've known him for 4 years so I met him about a month before it happened and I've always been here for him but i don't think what i did was that big a deal?\n\nSo aita?\n\nTldr ; My friend spoke to a girl, i spoke to her about d&d something she seemed to enjoy talking about and on the drive to his house accused me of taking away people who love him.\n\nSorry for any spelling mistakes.

      "scenario_description": "I am posting this from my boyfriend's account. And just a heads-up — this will be a long read, with a lot of details I believe are important, because I genuinely want to know if I'm in the wrong here.\n\nI live with my sister “S” and my boyfriend “B” — we rent an apartment together in a city that’s considered expensive by our country’s standards. To be clear, we’re not struggling, but we mostly only have enough for basic needs: rent, food, and occasional new clothes from fast fashion stores. My boyfriend and I both work, but my sister lives off money from our parents. We split rent and utilities three ways, but most of the groceries and household goods are paid for by me and my boyfriend.\n\nWe often treat her to good food, and just recently I bought her a new phone for her birthday since her old one completely broke. I gave it to her a month and a half early so it’d be more convenient for her, and she’s still getting a small birthday gift on the actual day — a dinner and some things related to her interests.\n\nA few days ago, she told me that she and our mom are planning a short trip abroad (3–4 days) at the end of summer or early autumn. They want to visit a nearby country where our uncle lives and plan to stay with him. But here’s the thing — he’s not a good person. He’s never cared about us, and none of us talk to him except for our mom. So expecting him to cover any expenses beyond offering a place to sleep is pointless.\n\nThey haven’t shared all the details of the trip with me, but they plan to visit a few cities nearby, and just for the transport alone it’ll cost them about $150 for each one of them. I know that doesn’t sound like much, but that’s basically a week of work for me. Neither S nor our mom works — mom lives on government support, and S gets some money from our dad (alimony) and a bit from mom and grandma. She keeps saying she’ll find a part-time job but hasn’t done it yet.\n\nObviously, the trip will cost more than just $150 — they’ll need food, entertainment, and it's important to note that while it's a neighboring country, prices there are higher than ours. When my sister first told me about the plan, I was caught off guard and reacted a bit harshly. I said they can’t afford it, and that this trip could impact my financial stability too. I also told her she shouldn’t be traveling with mom because their relationship is tense, and they shouldn’t rely on our uncle because he’s always acted like he’s above us.\n\nS didn’t listen — she just dropped the subject. I talked to my boyfriend and to a close friend, and they both agreed with me, but I still don’t feel 100% confident that I’m in the right.",

As I cannot afford to nor am I ready to get any sort of surgical procedures, I have been slowly trying to socially transition since I discovered myself at 16, and came out to my immediate family (Bio father, bio mother, and step father) at 17. \n\nI've chosen a name that resonates with me and I feel comfortable using in online spaces and with friends in school, (I have graduated but will present myself this way when I enter college). \n\nWhen I came out to my bio father, it was already a difficult conversation as he continues to misgender me, and told me he'll accept me but I'll \"always be his daughter\". And when I came out with a new name, he immediately said no. \n\nHe said no, as (prior to me even existing, therefore not even knowing this information) he knew someone with the same name, who did something horrible that I will not say here as it isn't necessarily my business, but it is disgusting. \n\nAs for my step father and bio mom, they said no because a member on my step father's side of the family uses that name, as it is his middle name and he prefers it over his first name that he doesn't like much. \n\nI feel guilty for choosing this name, as I don't want my family to feel uncomfortable with the separate associations. However, it's a name I feel comfortable using and had an odd time getting used to. But I don't want my family to continue deadnaming me and misgendering me, because it makes me upset. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\n(This is my first AITA post, so even if you do have the opinion of yes *please* keep it respectful.)",

At our family reunion I pulled my sister Maya aside and  asked her not to call me by Dita anymore Maya brushed it off and said that I was being overly sensitive and needed to calm down, I on the other hand was upset and tried asking other family members what to do. My mom, brother, grandma,aunts, and most of my cousins agreed with me while everyone else brushed it off like Maya had. Then Maya came up to me and said \" Can you stop bringing everyone in to this stupid fight between us?\" I had just had about enough so I looked her straight in the eye and said \"No.\" Now Maya is trying to mess my life up in every way she can but, I have to know AITA?",

I had decided it might make it all the better if I were to invite my Bestfriend and his GF. \n\nI gave them a 3 months heads up. And they both said they had wanted to go. My GF and I booked AirBNBs prior and thought it would be nice to offer them to stay with us as well. Something came up last minute with them and I thought it wasn’t that big of a deal. But 2 weeks before we went My Bestfriends GF had secretly planned a Birthday Trip to Bethany Beach (which is like 30-45 mins from Ocean City) at first I was confused and hurt but then I kinda pushed it aside because well it was his Birthday and maybe this was coincidence? \n\nSo I let it go because he had no idea this was going to happen. So fast forward my GF and I go on the vacation come back and not even a week later I find out He and his GF go to Washington DC. \n\nI confronted him about the timing and location of his trips to ours and explained to him it hurt me he did this when he could have went with us. He apologized if he hurt my feelings and said since it was my first real vacation and it was his 5th one this year an he wanted me to enjoy my first but I mentioned to him so many different times I told him I wanted him to come with us. And he told me he wanted to go too. Just makes me feel like they didn’t want to go in the first place with us. AITA??\n",

I really do appreciate it but growing up he always said that when my sister and I got married we’d each get fifteen thousand dollars to use however we wanted. Whether it was for a big wedding, eloping, saving for a house, it was supposed to be our choice.\n\nMy sister got married a couple years ago and had a big traditional wedding. My dad paid for everything with his credit card and she tracked all the costs in a spreadsheet. It ended up being about fifteen thousand.\n\nNow I’m engaged and my fiancé and I decided we want to elope and keep it super simple so we can save for a house. But now my dad is acting kind of weird about the money. He doesn’t really like the elopement idea and keeps saying we should just use his credit card and track expenses like my sister did.\n\nThe thing is we are not planning to spend anywhere near the full amount. I was hoping he would just give us the money like he always said so we could use it how we want. I get that maybe it feels different for him if he is not directly paying for stuff, but it kind of feels like we only get the full amount if we do things his way…. !? \n\nAm I being a spoiled brat for not wanting to follow the exact same plan my sister did?",

My partner drank heavily, including Jack Daniel's — something we both had agreed he would avoid due to his tendency to pick fights while drinking it.\n\nAfter waiting around 35–40 minutes for him to sort a ride home, I went to ask him for the house keys so I could arrange our own transport. I believe I asked politely and lightheartedly, even telling him he was free to stay out if he wanted.\n\nIn response, he screamed \"Get f*cked\" in my face in front of others, including my family and his daughter, then stormed out. Later, when I told him how hurtful and disrespectful his outburst was, he blamed me for being rude and claimed I \"deserved\" his response, saying that’s the only way I’d \"learn.\" He maintained this stance the next day while sober.\n\nI am now questioning whether I’m in the wrong for standing my ground, even though I truly don’t believe I was disrespectful.\n\nKey points:\n\n*He broke a mutual agreement not to drink Jack Daniel’s.\n*I made a reasonable request after waiting a long time.\n*His reaction was public, aggressive, and inappropriate.\n*He has shown no remorse and believes his behavior was justified.\n\n\n*UPDATE* \nOh my gosh I didn’t expect such a big response. \nI am reading all of your comments\nThank you all so much, I truly appreciate you all.\n\nTo those of you who are recovering, your doing amazing! I’m so incredibly proud of you all xo\n\n\n*We aren’t married but have been together for 6 years now. \nMy partner actually has two children, both from a previous marriage which ended due to his ex-wife’s infidelity.\nHis son was away camping the night this took place.\nSo, not my children but are treated like my own. \n\n*I do have my own set of house keys, but when we go out together we normally only take one set… I won’t be doing that again.\n\n*Honestly, my partner is generally a good guy, especially when sober. I know that’s hard to believe haha \n\n*He does tend to act a bit \"big-headed\" when around his mates from our local soccer club. They were also there when the incident occurred, but that doesn’t excuse his behavior. \n\nLike I’ve stated, I truly don’t think I was or meant to be disrespectful in the incident and I would have apologised if my partner had addressed the issue calmly. \n\nI will be speaking to him about all of this and what needs to change if our relationship is going to continue. \nIt’s currently school holidays here in Australia, so finding quite time is a little tricky atm. \n",

      "scenario_description": "I’m at a crossroads and I honestly want to know if I’m being petty, or if anyone would feel the same in my shoes.  Someone has repeatedly remotely accessed my private conversations.  I've discovered the likely access source and I'm trying to decide if I should take the high road and secure everything and move on or choose the asshole road and try to prove it/fight.\n\nMy ex and I lived together for years. Since I moved out, I’ve discovered a disturbing pattern: he’s repeatedly found ways to access my private life remotely. He’s dropped in on my Alexa devices, I’ve caught him catfishing me on dating apps (he admitted it), and I strongly suspect he’s still intercepting my phone data. And the worst part? He never fully admits it but he hints enough to confirm. He’ll quote things I’ve said, flash this smug little grin, and make comments that tell me he knows way more than he should. Enough to leave me spiraling, but not enough that the police care.\n\nOne of the first big moments: I was on the phone with friend having a very private, funny, kind of scandalous girl talk moment (not involving him). I said something I never would have said in any other context.  The next day, he said the exact same words to me. He didn’t just drop the phrase, he repeated it word-for-word, looked me in the eye, smirked, and walked away.\n\nAt the time, I had no idea what was going on. I went down every possible rabbit hole — hidden mic? Is my phone hacked? Did someone overhear me? Eventually I discovered he had access to the Alexa app I barely used and was dropping in on my devices without my knowledge. When I finally I confronted him, he laughed. He paid to replace my Alexas with Apple HomePods, like it was a joke to him.\n\nWe didn’t speak much for a while. But a few months ago, it happened again. (We have children we share custody of, the only reason we EVER speak). Another private phone conversation, another phrase thrown back at me. When I asked him directly, he just smiled and said something along the lines of, “You won't figure it out.”\n\nHere’s where I’m stuck: I know how to secure myself now. I've confirmed the source of access is likely attached to my old device old Apple ID and phone number, and access to my current Wi-FI.  I could reset my router, hire pros to reconfigure everything, wipe my devices, get a completely clean Apple ID, and just… move on.  But part of me wants justice. Or at least proof.\n\nSo… AITA if I don’t just let it go and move on, even though I have a clear path to do so now? Am I the asshole for wanting to catch him, for wanting confirmation instead of simply escaping?\n\nWould you fight? Or would you let it go?",

To blame him seemed so uncalled for and infuriated me. I then told her it is, in fact, her responsibility not to offer him junk food, the same way she wouldn't  offer my pre-diabetic brother-in-law food he's been avoiding in order to better his health. For context, she doesn't think that health conditions can be caused by poor eating, but rather they only occur by chance/family history of illness. She doesn't have much of a sense of the importance of proper nutrition. \n\nShe left my house pretty mad at me for calling her out on blaming my son for accepting junk food she offered him. AITA? ",

      "scenario_description": "So, let me give a little backstory/context. I'm trans FTM and 18. My father was very abusive to my mom and even me. I'm partly unmedicated for my mental health, getting situated slowly, as well as started testosterone 3 months ago. So obviously I'm changing. \n\nSo with everything changing with me I've acted a little different in her eyes, a few things I've warned her about with it being a side effect of T. Like agitation, easily irritated, you get the point. I'm also quite bad at understanding what she's talking about, I say I'm slow, others say I might have autism, I just say autistic tendencies since I was never diagnosed. So with how I am my mom and I have a few issues. Especially since I'm still healing from my childhood abuse, just started therapy a year ago. So I'm still used to shutting down or even getting defensive, I'm working on it. So now let's get into what happened.\n\nMy mom tells me stuff I already know, I do the same for her as I tend to over explain things, caused by trauma. So when she says something I know I say \"well yeah,\" and then explain how I know. I've done this for years and I can't seem to break the habit. She said something I knew so I said what I usually say. She immediately got upset and said I'm acting like a know it all and I sound like my dad. Which I got very upset about since I hate that man, as he caused a lot of my mental health issues. So I expressed that. She said my attitude has gotten worse lately and she's not saying I'm like him, but that I'm sounding like him. Either way, it hurt. I told her multiple times today that I don't hear the attitude she does and I'm not intentionally doing it. She refuses to listen to that.\n\nI'm not trying to have attitude, a lot of things have been happening these past few months since I started T and I'm trying my best. My childhood guinea pig died Saturday, before that our apartment burned down, and before that our cat died. And not even half a week ago I upped my ADHD meds. I'm not trying to make excuses for whatever she's hearing from me, I'm just trying to figure out how she's hearing it and how to get her to understand it's not intentional. After she talked she just told me to stop talking, and got upset when I tried to tell her my feelings, so I just stopped talking like she wanted me.\n\nBut AITA for getting upset at the comment, or was it deserved because of attitude/how I said it?",

      "scenario_description": "I 19 Female first child of a Nigerian household, I study abroad and my school fees are quite expensive. I work a part time job to cover part of my fees and rent and my parent covers the rest. My mom recently called me, whenever we talk or I talk to my da and I greet them I sometimes use ma or sir they were fine with that so I was used to not adding that to my greetings sometimes. Anyway she called me and i greeted her like I usually do. She got mad and said I was being disrespectful by not using ma and that is why people have reported me to her that I am a disrespectful child, she brought up an incident that happened four years ago where I was a victim of Islamophobia and my hijab was pulled off and said that was probably my fault. I apologized and said I have heard her. We talked a bit and she hung up I decided to call my dad too and talk to him since if I don't call in two days he gets mad.since I was used to greeting him without saying sir sometimes it kind of skipped my mind and greeted him without saying he got really mad and exploded over the phon3 saying my mom just talked to me about Dat i guess he was sitting beside my mom. I tried explaining but he angrily hung up. Now how it usually goes is I would call him back to apologize he would insult and scold me and hang up angrily. Then I would call about two more times before he gives an hr lecture disguised as advice. I decided not to call. My mom sent me two different vn yelling and scolding me and I sent just a message that she not be annoyed 'ma'. My sister used my mom's phone to call me and my mom snatched the phone and angrily hung up. After about 30min my other sister called me while we were talking my dad said he angrily hung up on me and I did not call back then he hung up. I called but he declined. The next day, my sister called me and told me my dad was mad at me and told my mom he hung up on me and I did not call back and she said I should just apologize and I should try not to make him angry. I am already depressed as hell because they hold everything they have done for me over my head. I want my freedom and my mental health back. While I was at work my mom called and sent a video where a lecture about being respectful and appreciative towards parents cuz some people do not have one. AITA",
