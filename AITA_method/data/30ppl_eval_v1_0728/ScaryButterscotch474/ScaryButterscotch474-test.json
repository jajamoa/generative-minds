      "scenario_description": "My (36, M) sister (34, F) moved into my house about 2 months ago with her 2 kids (7M, 4F) after she ended a really bad relationship\n\nI’ve always been an early-ish riser and like to get up and make myself some breakfast around 7 or 8am. Nothing spectacular, just whatever I felt like that day\n\nWhen my sister moved in, I realized quickly that she liked to sleep in. Some days she was up as late as 1pm…I gave her the benefit of the doubt since I knew how hard her break up was for her \n\n\nSince my sister slept so late daily, she wouldn’t get up and take care of her kids. I got into a routine with my niece and nephew that basically whatever I cooked myself for breakfast, I’d make enough for them as well until the other morning \n\nI woke up and had an urge to make huevos rancheros. The kids immediately started complaining that they didn’t want that and wanted something different\n\nI was nice and ended up making them pancakes since it’s not their fault that their mom is really struggling \n\nThe next morning, I was making breakfast potatoes and eggs but all I heard was “we don’t want that. We want something different” so again, I obliged…finally after 3 mornings of my unwanted food critics getting a separate meal, I finally told them “I’m no longer cooking 2 different meals for breakfast. If you don’t like what I’m making, go ask your mom to get up and do it”\n\nSo, they went upstairs to wake her up, but she still didn’t come downstairs until after 1pm. The kids immediately started complaining that I “refused to feed them” and my sister was PISSED\n\nShe started in about how they need to be fed by a certain time and a bunch of other things that she said to try and intentionally hurt me\n\nI snapped and told her “look I know you’re depressed, but wake up and take care of your fu**ing kids instead of expecting me to do it”\n\nShe got quiet after that and is still giving me the cold shoulder, but I know she’s expecting me to apologize.\n\nSorry this was long winded, but let me have it. AITA?\n\n",

I’ve been working with my therapist and although I’ve improved a TON, I still drink a little every day. \n\nI’ve never been to AA, as I haven’t found a group that completely cuts out the religious aspect (the southern US, what can ya do) but as I said I’ve worked a LOT with my therapist, so I’m not trying to do this by myself. My friends & family are aware & supportive. \n\nSo, I don’t know if it’s just the shame/guilt/trauma talking, but if I still drink 1-2 drinks almost every day, do I need to disclose this to a stranger that might move into my apartment? \n\nETA: i don’t think I should live with someone who drinks heavily, so I would want to know this info. However it’s very personal so I don’t know if I would be an AH for wanting to know beforehand either? \n\nIt seems like a thin line between being invasive and also being important info for someone you live with to be aware of\n\nETA2: i don’t know how you get diagnosed as an alcoholic other than recognizing unacceptable behavior while drinking. My abusive ex is the only one that ever called me an alcoholic, and I do not take that accusation lightly, so I have been treating my unhealthy habits as addiction. \n\nI have gone 1-2 days without drinking, or even wanting a drink recently.

      "post_title": "AITA for stopping paying my ex's bills.",
      "scenario_description": "Alt account so I don't doxx my main. \n\nMy ex and I split up about three years ago. No bad feelings, we just drifted apart until we realised that we were now co-parents not husband and wife any more. We have two kids, 13 and 10. My ex used to work as an infrastructure engineer and I was working as an owner driver with my own truck.\n\nAt around the time the kids were born we decided she was going to be a stay at home mum, the trucking was going well and I had brought a second truck and a van so I stayed home doing all the planning and admin, while I had the trucks and van out.\n \nWhen the smallest started school the ex went back to work part-time but her time out of the workforce had hit her really hard and she needed to learn lots of stuff and basically she couldn't get back in at her previous level and had to pretty much start over. Over the years the haulage firm had expanded and frankly it was getting a bit of a pain in the arse, we were too big for where we were and were needing to move to a new yard so I sold it off for a reasonable sum and set up freelancing as a dev. (Did Computer Science at Uni). \n\nWe both had relatives pass away leaving us property and money. So we were mortgage free on the family home. When we split, I moved into a house that I had inherited, we basically split the assets in half, split the costs of the kids activities in half. And when we were sat looking at the money she concluded that she would need to go back to work full time and she would miss time with the kids, as they were with me the three days she was at work and every other weekend I felt a bit bad for that, because if she hadn't  been out of work for so long then she would be in a better place career wise. \n\nSo I offered to cover half of her bills until the kids went off to uni. She didn't want to at first but I said to her that she helped me out and had now suffered as a result so it was only fair that I returned the favour, it's helping my kids out, and I didn't want her to be running down the savings that was essentially the kids inheritance. \n\nSo this situation has worked out about as well as it can, we co-parent happily, everything is all good. Until she met a new guy. He's someone we knew from way back but we lost touch with. They started dating, she's really happy and she's talking about him moving in. Which I'm ok with, the kids get on with him and I trust her judgement and know that she wouldn't put anything ahead of the kids.\n\nSo I said to her, if laddo is moving in you won't need the money towards the bills will you? She said no she wouldn't, but she was thinking of putting it into the kids accounts. Great idea says me. I'll put some on their cards for pocket money and the rest in their savings. So that was what we agreed. \n\nBut when new chap found out he went up the wall and accused me of being controlling and financial abuse. A few of our friends have also said that he's got a point and that it looks like jealousy. So AITA here?\n\n\nUPDATE:\nEDITS and clarification:\n\nWe have joint 50/50 custody of the kids so I have no actual obligation to be paying anything, but that said, I don't want my kids to miss out on their many and varied activities so I carry on paying for half of those. Likewise I offered the extra money to help with bills because I wanted my kids to benefit from time with both parents and also to not have to live in a house where money is a worry. \n\nSome have mentioned when division of assets from inheritance and selling my business, these are mostly locked away in long term investments so they aren't available. We were perhaps unwise in doing this, but we saw it as the kids' inheritance. My ex would rather have worked more than dipped into that money for living costs. \n\nThe ex has been round for a cup of tea and a chat, it seems that laddo was indeed thinking that she was his meal ticket, apparently he had suggested moving in but NOT told her that his landlord was ending his tenancy on a section 21 to sell the property. When she started discussing money and his contribution he asked why when I was paying for the kids. So she told him if he was living there he needed to chip in, and that if he moved in she couldn't keep asking for money from me.\n\nSo she's upset and I think that's going to be over, in the meantime he's ranting to anyone that'll listen that I'm the typical evil jealous ex and controlling her with money.

      "scenario_description": "My (29F) husband (32M) and I have been married for 3 years, long distance because of the military. I’ve lived with his family during this time renting out a space. MIL had really welcomed me—I loved living there. Meanwhile, she’s been in the long term process of divorcing FIL, staying until now for financial reasons.\n\nThe last months of my time there, I was nearing the end of my pregnancy and my husband was preparing to deploy. It had been determined that I would move back in with my parents with the baby so my parents could help me with childcare. MIL offered for me and my husband to keep our stuff in the room upstairs as free storage until he’s back from deployment and we get our own place. I offered to pay her for it multiples times, she declined. When things were getting more heated between her and FIL, approximately 6 weeks before my due date/husband’s deployment date, I asked if she’d want us to move our stuff to an actual storage place—she said no, our stuff could stay.\n\nTwo weeks after a C section and 36 hours from my husband’s deployment, we were about to drive over with baby to my family’s house. MIL and FIL had an ongoing argument essentially about FIL wanting to move out because they were fighting so much and MIL wanting him to stay to help out with a planned surgery she had. FIL also had told her that he wasn’t going to financially support her unless he was forced to. She asked my husband to take sides with her and force FIL to stay. My husband told her he wasn’t comfortable getting in the middle of things. MIL became upset, and suddenly told us that if he wouldn’t help her in this argument, then we should move all our stuff out ASAP because she might have to sell the house.\n\nI expressed that it was a lot for her to throw on us (mainly me) all of a sudden, no yelling involved. That night she sent a lengthy text about how he and I were extremely selfish and not considering her situation and laid out all the kind things she’s ever done for us and how could we treat her this way etc.\n\nI reached out to try to talk. She texted me she wasn’t sure she’d ever be able to forgive us but would listen to what I had to say. Later on she changed her mind and said she didn’t want to talk after all.\n\nOur stuff is now in storage. I recently stopped by the house to pick up leftover stuff (FIL offered to take it to me but I wanted MIL to have a chance to see baby). Prior to going I’d asked and she’d texted that we were welcome to stop by anytime. However, she ignored my greeting when we arrived, refused to see baby when I offered and yelled at me when I told her that I wasn’t comfortable going over either but just wanted her to have a chance to see grandbaby. This time I did yell back about how she was calling me inconsiderate when she was also not considering my situation when she dropped the move on us. She texted my husband that she is upset with me for my attitude the original night and this latest visit and is now claiming that I am emotionally abusing her.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "So I recently went to my boyfriend’s father’s wedding (remarriage) His father was kind enough to take into account my gluten allergy and made sure to have 8/10 dishes gluten free. He also included a separate GF dessert which was little Bundt cakes. \n\nI was so excited to actually eat at the wedding. Most times for a public event I either eat before due to my allergy. \n\nAfter dinner, the cake was being cut and then it was announced to come get dessert. I was finishing up a conversation (took 30-45 seconds) when my boyfriends uncle (who is the only other GF person) came up to me with a cake and told me that all ten cakes were gone and he had the last one, offering to share half. \n\nI was upset. I know that only 2 people had an allergy there. I immediately went over to investigate the gluten free cakes with my boyfriend following. \n\nI went over and i spotted a family who I know well and I KNOW are not GF, and went up to confront them. When I got there I saw them have not one, not two, but THREE GF cakes all of which were eaten except for a tiny sliver of one and the other that the husband was just finishing off.  I politely ask the husband if he was GF (knowing full well he wasn’t) He responded “well ya totally I prefer gluten free it tastes better ya…” I look at him and told him that I have an allergy and I didn’t get any.  after an awkward moment, the wife finally says “oh well…here you can have this if you want…” and she reached to give me the mostly eaten cake. I told them no it’s fine just next time don’t eat allergen friendly food if you don’t have an allergy and walked off to my boyfriend who was only a few feet away and told him everything. \n\nA bit later I was talking to some friends when the wife came up behind me and said “hey that wasn’t very nice what you did back there. You made us feel very uncomfortable and my husband feels bad and uncomfortable with your actions. It would be nice of you to go an apologize to him.” I daid “sorry?”And she said just go over and apologize. I bit my tongue and went to talk to my boyfriend In private. I told him I was in fact not sorry and had no regret for calling out them eating MY allergy friendly food. He agreed with me and told me not to apologize and ignore the incident. But I can’t get this off my mind…\n\nSo am I the asshole and should I go apologize  for making the family feel uncomfortable??\n\nEDIT: My boyfriend told me to edit this to inform I was Autistic so if I seem dense in the comments I’m genuinely not understanding and am taking it literally. THIS IS NOT TO EXCUSE MY ACTIONS ONLY EXPLAIN MY EXTRA QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS!! (bottom should have the original post! ) \n\nEDIT: I realize I left out some info pointed out i. In comments. Idk if it matters. The family I confronted was in charge of the dessert table as the caterers were only in charge of dinner. Dessert was set up by the family and was told by the groom to section off and keep the GF cakes separate and were also told who they were for explicitly. ",

Especially for people who are vegetarian or vegan etc. it’s worse for a buffet because they usually put the special food in the end of the table. Which means everyone lines up and goes past the special food first and you are lucky if there is any left by the time that you get to it. \n\nPersonally I didn’t pay too much attention until someone pointed out the problem. I just assumed I could eat it and didn’t think about it being reserved just for allergies etc. Now I am very mindful of ensuring that others with allergies have enough food. Hopefully these people are more mindful in the future.\n\nNext time that you identify your allergy at the event, send them a little message and ask if your name can be written on the food.\n\nI have seen events where plates are named on the buffet table. It does the trick. People won’t take a named plate.",

We're not even fully unpacked, when my wife's parents said \"hey next month can we come stay 3 nights over the weekend?\" It would be her mom, dad and the two youngest siblings. The week they asked they changed their mind, packed the car and just drove here. They got here on a Sunday and said we're only staying 3 nights. Then 2 nights into it said we want to stay 1 more night. \nNow her sister wants to come up here and spend the weekend. This whole week there's a few people staying over. I WANT EVERYONE GONE. I'm working late to not come home. My routine is gone. I need to mow and do other house chores. They keep our toddler up late and just sit at the table drinking beer. Yeah sure they bought us some great house gifts and I feel twisted. \nI do care about them and want my wife's family and want her to see them. \nAm I the asshole for telling my wife never to do this again and asking them to leave early? Also never allow people to stay here during the week when I have to go to work? ",

      "post_title": "AITA For not giving my son $10K?",
      "scenario_description": "My son married his high school sweetheart in 2011. Disaster for many reasons but end result was that they had two kids then divorced 7-8 years ago. They live in VA, which is known as a state that favors mothers custody. She has primary custody and he has some visitation. \n\nHe is getting hit pretty hard on child support and wants to have 50/50 custody of his kids as well as being fully informed on medical, school, etc. We totally agree with those desires. His ex-wife is very bad at communications, the recent court ordered co-parenting sessions were horrible. We doubt how she acts is going to change. But, since he has been a teenager, our son has had a tendency to believe that if he really wants something to have a certain result, he will get it. He has been to court with his ex multiple times, most recently asking again for shared custody. He truly believes, each time, that he will get what he wants regardless of past history.\n\nThe first time he went to court (this round) he represented himself and got his butt handed to him. He got a lawyer, spent more time with the kids GAL and went back to court, this time with the lawyer. Spent over $10K, owes $13K more. Got marginally better results but had a follow-up end of June. That follow up was last Friday and he represented himself again. He came out angry and \"too raw\" to talk about it. But he did leave me a long text message expressing how very disappointed he was in me. As his mother, and grandmother of the kids, he expected me to move heaven and earth to help him afford a lawyer. He knows we have our own issues (my husband, his step-father is currently fighting cancer) but he NEEDED me and I failed him and his kids. He expected more of me and was let down. The end of that note said that he didn't want to talk about it because he was so raw he would \"devolve into an anger monster\" and say things he shouldn't.\n\nHe didn't want to talk so I didn't call. I did text him that was one of the most disappointing things I've ever read from him. He didn't understand but we could talk about it later. Today I got another very long text from him asked if I could give him $10K and not only would it be paid back once his child support got lowered but that would guarantee he would get custody of his children. He went on to say he has a slim chance at a mistrial but he almost won't do it without a lawyer (smart) and OMG he went into full manipulation mode giving me the reasons he can't hire a lawyer so as their grandmother, as his mother, will I loan him the money if he files for a mistrial.\n\nOk, to me, he is assuming that 1) he has the grounds for a mistrial 2) his child support amount would be lowered 3) he would get more custody of his girls and 4) that $10K would solve all of those problems. He is 40+. Shouldn't he be relying more on himself? We have bailed him out financially once before with car loan he ran away from for more then $10K. He doesn't seem to be learning. AITA for saying no?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "I hope you all can help. Before I start, english is not my native language so forgive any mistakes.\nI’m 19, my mom and I wanted to do make overs (is that what they’re called?) for our rooms and bathrooms, our bathrooms aren’t really functional anymore. And personally I didn't like my room’s walls and furniture that much.\nSo we contacted the same Architect who we worked with before and we really like her work. She did an amazing job with the bathrooms, the floors, and the walls of our rooms. At first I planned to buy my new furniture but she offered to order a custom one for me so that I could get exactly what I wanted and I agreed because she did the same for my older sister’s room and it looked amazing.\nI sat with her and showed her the rooms I liked online and the exact type of wood I wanted and I even drew her the room (I’m an artist) and coloured them with the colour of the wood I wanted, I made it very clear I wanted a light kind of wood and told her the colour palette I wanted for my room (light wood with yellow and green decorations). And she made the order.\n\nThat was over a month ago, today I received a sample of the wood they used. It wasn’t what I wanted. It was much darker and completely different than all the pictures I gave. I contacted her to see what’s wrong and she said they told her it’s the lightest they have and it’s like this because of varnish but shouldn’t varnish be like..transparent? I know varnish is meant to protect the wood but I asked if they can just not apply it since the back of the sample is closer to what I wanted and she said they already painted my closet with it.\nShe offered I go see it tomorrow and I agreed but I’m worried that won’t make me like it because it’s VERY different and I already paid 3200 dollars for it which where I live is a lot. \nSo, if I don’t like it..would I be the asshole if I ask for a refund from them or her? Do I even have the right to ask for it or be upset about it since it’s literally a layer meant to protect the wood? Should I just take it and sell it to someone else? I'm really lost on what the right thing to do is because that colour is REALLY not what I wanted.\n\nEdit: as some of you suggest I used a wet cloth to wet the side that wasn’t varnished and it looked pretty different than the varnished side, even closer to what I wanted I’d say. So it looks like the problem was the type of varnish they used not the wood itself, which already solves a lot of my issues! I’ll go see it for myself tomorrow though and update on how things go, thanks everyone :,)",

      "scenario_description": "Me 45f and my husband 50m in were at a resort with a pool. We were sitting at the swim up bar and we noticed that some of the loungers that are on a ledge in the pool were being vacated by a couple. There were tons of these loungers open but this particular set had an umbrella.  The couple in the chairs got up and walked away. We got up from the bar and went to the hot tub. When we got back 15 mins later those two loungers were empty. The couple who was in the chairs had left their towels on the pool deck behind the chairs and a small bag. While we were lounging the wife comes back. She tells me we stole her chairs. An argument ensued. I said these chairs are not reservable and you left. She said I know they aren’t reservable but we were just going to the water slide. I said you have been gone awhile so the seats are up for grabs. She leaves and comes back with her husband who says let’s just go. She keeps arguing with me saying these were their chairs and they just went to go down the slide. Her husband convinces her to leave after saying that people like me are what’s wrong with the world. I said no it’s people like you that feel like you are entitled in a public area to hog and hold chairs.   As she is leaving she tosses her cup at my back.  So, AITA.  I can’t attach the picture but it’s a huge hotel pool with a ledge. There are easily 100 of these loungers. Only 6 are under an umbrella. Tons of chairs are open when she approaches me. ",

She's my wife's sister and we tend to see each other at least once a month for family events.\n\nFor my wife and I, we manage our kids ourselves.  If we go somewhere, one of us is always keeping an eye on them, making sure they're not getting into trouble - especially making sure the youngest (a toddler) is safe - changing her if necessary, refilling her sippy cup, stuff like that.  Its our job.  If something happens, one of us pops up and takes care of it.\n\nSIL and her husband take a different approach and are frequently asking for help.  If we're all eating dinner and their kid has a poopy diaper, they'll sometimes get it, sometimes turn to one of us and ask \"would you mind?\"  The other day, I'm at a party and just came back inside after getting something for my kids, ready to sit down to eat and SIL asks \"\\[Baby\\] left her sippy cup upstairs - would you mind getting it?\"  Her and her husband both sitting down and perfectly capable.  It's not like they've asked a few times when they're overwhelmed or there's only one of them - there's been times one of them is lying on a couch reaching a book and ask me for something.\n\nIt's not like what they ask for anything I'd consider a huge inconvenience, so I feel petty saying something - but part of me just wants to say \"Look, my wife and I are responsible for our kids - you're responsible for yours.  I don't ask you to change our kids' diapers or grab their sippy cups from the next room, don't ask me.\"  WIBTA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "My husband had been sick for a long time. I was his carer and was able to work from home to be there when he needed me. When we went to hospital I was his advocate.  His children would call or stop by just to ask for money. I even gave up a works bonus to give it all to his daughter. We took £1000 out of our limited savings to help the other with the understanding she would pay it back. We did not expect massive payments, just like £20 a month. \nMy husband finally realised what they were doing and stopped giving them money. This was about 2 years before he passed. The girls stopped calling or coming by at all once the bank dried up. \nI could see how badly it affected him, at times he would just stare off into space and say he missed them.  Both girls had changed their phone numbers and had moved from their home so we had no way to get in touch.our numbers were the same. The landline was about ten years old and the mobiles about 8 years. So they could have called anytime or stopped by as we had been at that address for 14 years. \nMy passed at the end of December. It was really unexpected as he was doing ok. I was absolutely hysterical about his death. And then I found out the corner may wish to do an autopsy as it was unexpected. \nThe time of year made a backlog of cases for the coroner, so we had to wait. \nIt took me a week to even think of notifying his daughters. I realise I should have tried to reach out earlier, but I was not doing well with the loss. \nI remembered one of the daughters having a Facebook account so I looked through and found her. I sent her the message ‘please call, urgent’\nI got a call almost immediately and told her what had happened. About 20 minutes later there was frantic knocking on the door. The younger of his girls was out there spitting fire it took me a week to tell them. She asked when the funeral was being held and we told her we didn’t know but would be  telling them the minute we found out. She accused me of lying about it and that I wouldn’t let them know when their own father’s funeral real would be. \n\nA few days later I started get text messages with ‘I want this item or that one’ it was becoming ridiculous. I rounded up everything that had been theirs and gave it to them. Plus more from the texts the asked for.\nIt was funny after 2 years of silence suddenly they wanted rings of his. \nI was finally able to arrange his funeral and a few days later his ashes were delivered to me. The final text I got from them was can we have some of his ashes for remembrance jewelry. \nI said No. I told them my husband had never even wanted me to notify them he had died…so I was going to give them any of his ashes…\nAITA for not giving them some of his ashes?\n\nEdited:\nI get that a lot of you are condemning me for the late notification of their father’s death. I understand where you’re coming from. What you have to understand is I got up to use the toilet at 3am went back to bed next to him and then woke up at 4;05 am and he was gone!. He had a DNR in place so I couldn’t even try to give him CPR. The doctor was called and I sat downstairs waiting for the results of the exam to verify his death and I honestly thought the doctor was going to say I have arranged ambulance to rush him to hospital. Instead he said his condolences. Called the police to stand guard over our bedroom u til the corner got there hours later.  \nI was in such shock I sat in his favourite chair, for days,barely ate,and just stared at nothing.  It took a week for my brain to even comprehend he was gone. Kept thinking he was just at hospital. I have learned since that the trauma of waking up next to him kind of shut my bat in down to try and protect me from the pain. \nSo I agree they should have been to,d right away, but I was in no state to think rationally and as soon as my brain stated working I tried to find a way to contact them.

      "scenario_description": "My daughter is 13 and she goes to a small school. Her grade only has 18 students (10 boys and 8 girls). My daughter also has other friends from the sports she does. We plan to have her go to a much larger high school in the future. Her 13th birthday party was last weekend and I asked who she wanted to invite, she wanted to invite 7 of the girls from her class and 5 from her soccer team. The one girl she doesn't want to invite is name Kelly.\n\nMy daughter doesn't like Kelly, she is the class clown in her grade and my daughter hides her annoying and attention seeking. I asked her why she didn't want her there and her response was \"she ruins school for me all the time, I don't want her to ruin my birthday.\" I agreed with her list and sent the invites out.\n\nMy ex-wife is invited to all her major milestone instead of us doing separate events. I learned an hour beofre the party my ex-wife sent an invte to Kelly since her mom found out about the party. My daughter was not happy to see her (it was a suprise for her), I told her to enjoy the party.\n\nIt was going well until the cake came out, my daughter wanted a glitter cake (when you blow out the candles glitter goes everywhere). While everyone was around the cake, Kelly took her fingers and swiped icing off the top layer of the cake. It ruined the cake and my daughter lost it. She yelled at Kelly, basically saying, \" what is wrong with you, this is why I didn't want you her and that you ruin everything.\" She ran to her room after and Kelly was crying.\n\nKelly's parent is wanting an apolgy, my ex-wife wants her to apoligze as well. I am refusing to make her do that or punish her at all. I pointed out that my ex never should have invited her and to the mom that her child ruined the cake, and that at 12 years old should know better. They are calling me an ass and my daughter is just upset.,",

      "scenario_description": "As some background information, I (16, male) have an extremely large collection of stuffed animals, including Jellycats, Care Bears, and Build-A-Bears which I began collecting when I was around 11 or 12. I was bullied during my childhood for being autistic and spent a lot of time in hospitals which I feel like I had to act more mature than what I was to try and deal with it, so collecting these toys has helped me reconnect with my younger self. I will admit I do have a very big connection to them they all have names and personalities\n\nMy mom has been very supportive when it comes to my neurodivergence but my stepdad isn't, My relationship with my stepdad has always been strained. A month ago, he stopped taking his medication for depression, believing he didn’t need it. Since then, our interactions have deteriorated. We’ve been snapping at each other, and my attempts to set boundaries have been ignored; he sees them as an attack on him.\n\nThe main reason I came here is that yesterday I was running late for a taster day at the college I'm starting at, and I accidentally left my door open. I thought it would be fine since we have a gate at the top of the stairs to stop our dogs from coming up. When I got home, I realised that my only childhood stuffed animal I've kept, Charleston, wasn’t on my bed. I tried looking around, thinking maybe I had left it on the floor, but he wasn’t there.\n\nI went downstairs to ask my stepdad if he had seen Charleston, and he told me that the dogs had taken him off my bed. He let the dogs have him because he thought it was “just a stupid stuffed toy that I should have left behind in secondary school.” I feel like I might have overreacted because I shouted at him, telling him he had no right to throw my stuffed animal away like that. I know I shouldn’t have but I swore at him.\n\nIt escalated into a fight where he said that I need to start acting like an adult, get a job, and grow up. And that I'm a slob. He isn't entirely wrong; I've been putting off getting a job before starting college to see if I can handle it.  In the heat of the moment, I told him he was weighing down the family and that my life was better before he married my mom. I ended up going through the trash and found Charleston. He was completely fine, just a bit dirty, which was an easy fix. I haven't spoken to my stepdad since.\n\nMy mom thinks I’m being overdramatic since it’s just a stuffed animal, but to me, it means so much more than that. My stepdad has always hated Charleston, as if his very existence offends him. I’m wondering how the dogs got to Charleston if the gate was closed and why he didn’t have any marks on him. If my dog had gotten hold of him, there would only be shreds left. They both know how much Charleston means to me; he’s been there for me through every surgery and bad day at school. Plus,  the toy was discontinued, so if I hadn’t found him, I wouldn’t have been able to buy another. ATIA?\n\nEdit: hi guys and ty for the positive comments! I just wanna clarify for people asking more about why I haven’t gotten a job . I was only legally able to work for the last two months of secondary school and my main concern was sitting my GCSE’s . Me and my mom had agreed on me waiting before working . And my stepdad had agreed till recently we also wanted to focus on getting my health back to a good place before I started college ",

      "scenario_description": "I (22f) was invited in April to attend a concert in May with an old friend (22m). By the way he invited me, it sounded like he was covering the costs, so I accepted. He later told me that I would be paying for my ticket and that I could just venmo him the amount. I didn't/don't have a job right now so I told him as such, and he said I could pay him back in \"2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months,\" it didn't matter as long as I eventually paid him back. I promised him I'd pay him as soon as I got a job because I hated owing people money in the sense that they will be anxious until I pay them back. He accepted.\n\nFast forward to about a week before the concert. My parents ended up gifting me the money to pay him on the night of the concert. I got a text from him requesting the money right then and there. He said if I've changed my mind to let him know asap so he could sell the extra ticket. The fact that he was suddenly switching his attitude from \"pay me whenever\" to \"pay me now\" rubbed me the wrong way. That plus some comments he's made before about my health just made me feel... unsafe? Like he didn't consider me or my situation? It all just felt off to me (as well as my parents) so I respectfully said I had changed my mind but I hoped he had a lot of fun. There was no hostility in his reply, so I figured we were good.\n\nHe is normally *very* active on social media -- always the first to look at my stories, one of the first to like my posts. But ever since that exchange, he's been a ghost. I know he's fine and well because he's still active on his account, just not with my stuff. It's made me feel like he's mad at me about the situation. I talked to my parents about the situation and they said I went about it in the right way, but with his ignoring me, I'm worried I might be TA.",
