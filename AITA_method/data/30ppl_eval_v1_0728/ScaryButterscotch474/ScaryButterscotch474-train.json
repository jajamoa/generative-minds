      "scenario_description": "I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. \n\nIn the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. \n\nI am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. \n\nThey’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. \n\nYesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. \n\nI had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. \n\nMy kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. \n\nBut afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. \n\nSo AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",

I know nothing about leasing a horse so I posted on our town facebook page looking for information on leasing a horse. My brother comments with really? “jills” mom comments wtf and then texts me saying how I hurt and embarrassed her daughter.\n\nFirst of all we’re grown ass adults if I hurt your daughter shouldn’t she text me? And second of all I’m a paying customer. If l was unhappy with a service shouldn’t I be able to go elsewhere? If I wasn’t happy with my hair dresser I wouldn’t stay. But again, I was simply inquiring. Should I have stated asking for a friend? Maybe. Should it matter? I don’t think so. Now I’m afraid of retaliation against my daughter, like they’re going to kick her out of the barn or something.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit to add: SIL does not offer a leasing service.

      "scenario_description": "So I (16F) am quite sensitive to loud noises. We bought a vertical vacuum cleaner last year. The issue is that it makes an annoying and loud noise! You can hear it from the first room to the last. It's even noisier than our big vacuum cleaner.\n\nAnother issue is that my mom uses it excessively. Even when the house is clean, she still uses it. The vacuum always wakes me up at 9:00 a.m. (she even enters my room with it!). We also have a robot vacuum cleaner, but before she turns that on, she vacuums. Then, while the robot vacuum is cleaning, she vacuums again. And after the robot is done, she vacuums again!\n\nSometimes she vacuums as late as 10 p.m. Even when we have guests over, she vacuums the whole house. While I’m doing online classes or studying, she turns it on. The noise is starting to drive me crazy  even earplugs don’t help completely.\n\nI don't even see any dirt at home, and she's vacuuming the whole house constantly, like 24/7. I'm not against her being clean or vacuuming. I like being clean too, I even help her sometimes and vacuum my own room too. But it has been really becoming unbearable.  So last night, I have talked with my parents about it. They called me selfish for telling her to not vacuum excessively they also said it's their house and they can do whatever they want and I have no right to say something about it. My grandparents disagreed with them, and they are on my side right now. Again, Im not against her vacuuming but doing it excessively even the house is clean enough really started to be annoying(same with my grandparents) AITA here?",

      "scenario_description": "Posting for a friend who wishes to stay anonymous.\n\nHi, my name is Lois. My husband Bryan and I adopted our son James through a private adoption. He’s nine months old now, but at the time of this story, he was six months and had just come home from the ER after a couple of nights due to low oxygen levels (he’s fine now, just has minor non-life-threatening health issues).\nBefore we knew we’d be adopting James, we had a trip to NYC booked for our anniversary. When the time came, I was torn—do we take him or leave him with my mom and sister (both RNs who watch him often)? Ultimately, we decided it was safer and more stable for James to stay with them, where he had doctors familiar with his history. It broke my heart to leave him, but we felt it was best. My best friend Harper, who watches James every other Friday (only twice a month), agreed to help on one of the days we were gone. I was really grateful. Two weeks later was her regularly scheduled Friday. She hadn’t watched James in a while because she’s been backing out a lot last-minute, so my brother-in-law has had to fill in. On this Friday, I mistakenly thought James was with my brother-in-law and not Harper. After work, I stopped by the store when Harper called asking if I was late to pick up James. I was mortified and apologized, saying I was 10 minutes away and had mixed up who had him. She said nothing then, but I didn’t hear from her for weeks. I finally texted asking if we were okay, and she asked me to call her. When I did, she told me I was a bad mom, that I adopted James for the wrong reasons, and said it seemed like I just wanted an accessory, like a pet. I was devastated. We’ve been best friends for 20 years. My husband and I tried to conceive for over five years before turning to adoption. We chose private adoption specifically to avoid agencies that pressure birth moms—we personally knew James’s birth mom and offered her support if she wanted to raise him herself. It was a decision made with love and care. I told Harper her words deeply hurt me and that leaving James behind on the trip and being late to pick him up once didn’t make me a bad mom. But those were the two things she cited. It’s been weeks. She hasn’t apologized, but two days ago she texted asking if I needed her to watch James next Friday. I responded that I’d rather focus on repairing our friendship and that I didn’t want to strain things further by asking her to babysit. I asked where we stood, but she’s since ghosted me. I’ve always supported her through her journey as a young mom without judgment. I’m trying to figure out if I’m in the wrong here, or if it’s time to walk away after 20 years. I’m open to honest feedback.",

      "scenario_description": "My mom passed away two years ago, and the house she shared with my dad was left to him. He moved to Mexico for a while and rented it to me, my fiancé, and a roommate (his best friend’s daughter). The roommate moved out after failing to pay rent, but I continued covering the mortgage and invested in repairs — new floors, plumbing, cleaning, etc.\n\nMy dad recently moved back and now lives downstairs. We split the mortgage since he can’t afford it alone. I want to keep the house in the family. My fiancé and I live upstairs. I’m 5.5 months pregnant and work as a flight attendant, so I’m often gone and exhausted.\n\nMy sister has a 3-year-old daughter with a man (BD) who was abusive to her. They broke up, but she let him stay with her while he \"figured things out.\" She moved to a new place with a new boyfriend but let BD stay at my house so he could see their daughter on his “days.” He’s not on the lease, pays no rent, doesn’t work, and I didn’t have a say. She’s comfortable with him watching their daughter here rather than at a hotel or a new place where he would be living with random roommates.\n\nThe spare bedroom upstairs is basically a laundry/storage room with a bed. I asked my sister to help clean it if BD wanted to sleep there. She said she would but never did. I cleaned and washed linens myself. Still, BD sleeps on the couch in just his underwear and walks around shirtless. It makes me extremely uncomfortable, especially being pregnant.\n\nThe other night, I made soup and was with my niece. My fiancé came home, and we were trying to have a normal evening. My niece peed on the couch, and her parents (my sister and BD) were cleaning it. I told them the bed is clean and BD needs to sleep there, not on the couch. If he has issues, he can clean or bag the laundry. Which she said she would help me do and never did. \n\nMy sister blew up. She said her daughter is more comfortable sleeping on the couch with her dad and that I’m “kicking a 3-year-old off the couch.” She called the room a “dirty ass room” no one would want to sleep in, even though I cleaned it. She accused me of “acting like a victim” and “blowing up,” even though I’d been asking nicely for weeks.\n\nShe insists the house is just as much hers as mine because it belonged to our mom. Today she threatened to start paying part of the mortgage so I “can’t keep acting like it’s only my house.”\n\nHer 3-year-old daughter has basically no discipline and dictates where she sleeps. My sister lets it happen. I don’t plan to let a toddler control my living space or override adult boundaries.\n\nAfter this, BD left and got a hotel because he felt I wasn’t “welcoming enough.” My sister had to take her daughter to her own house and got upset with me for “ruining her plans” — as if setting boundaries in my home is the problem.\n\nTo be clear:\n\nMy sister doesn’t live here or pay rent.\nBD is here for free with no responsibilities.\nI pay the mortgage and maintain the house.\nI’m pregnant and just want respect and boundaries.\n\nUPDATE: \n\nWoke up to this text from my dad\n\nI got this text from my dad this morning as I woke up (in a group chat with me, him and my sister)\n\nThis episode of yall arguing yesterday was uncalled for. I hate it. Let’s all learn to discuss things in a cool headed tone with respect. If **** (BD) needs a place to stay or sleep he can certainly stay upstairs preferably in more than boxer shorts lol. He just needs to help contribute to the bills. As **** (my mother) would say family is everything and just because (BD) is an ex of (my sister) he’s still (my nieces) father. But I’ll say this, if he ever puts his hands on (my sister)  again it’ll be the last thing he does.",

      "scenario_description": "I (27NBi) have been in an argument with a friend (31F) for about 3 months now.\n\n\n\nFor background, we both help another friend home school her 11 year old son. I'm currently studying my Master of Teaching. My friend, we'll call her Emily, teaches art classes on the weekend.  I'm teaching the child English and HASS, Emily is teaching art and her partner (32NBi) is teaching maths. The goal was to get him re-engaged with education.\n\n\n\nEmily was used to teaching people who had paid to be there. She didn't know how to teach someone who didn't want to be there. She would basically tell him if he didn't he would have a consequence.\n\nAt first, I tried to tell her gently that her approach won't help him learn. She kept brushing me off, so I started to get more direct. She started shutting me down harder.\n\n\n\nAbout 3 months ago, she said in the group chat that she had told the kid he was being \"manipulative,\" and he got upset. Her partner commented that manipulative can have neutral and positive connotations, to which she agreed.\n\n\n\nI said that manipulative is a word that is generally negative. Emily wrote: \"OP. It's sorted. We've moved on.\"  I said that while it's sorted this time, what about next time? I said that it was shitty she was blaming the kid for everything, while refusing to look at her own behaviour. It ended with Emily calling me cruel for coming in with anger and insults and told me to \"enjoy my moment.\"\n\n\n\nAt 10pm, I got a message from Emily. It was about 5 paragraphs long, telling me that I had been bullying her for months, giving her small comments about her appearance. I remember telling her if her lipstick smudged, or if her shirt was undone. Things that she had expressed she'd prefer that I tell her. She also said that I was criticising her teaching.\n\n\n\nI responded to all her points, basically saying I felt she was being unfair for not telling me about the insults and deflecting from what I've been trying to tell her about her teaching.\n\n\n\nI said I'd like to see a councellor. She said \"if you feel it's necessary.\" I said I do, because I don't feel like she's open to listening to anything I'm saying. She said she's not, and she was worried that I was just going to brush off all accountability. I said ok, I'm done. There's no moving forward if her voice is the only one.\n\n\n\nLater in the week, she sent me a message saying that she didn't say that she was against counselling, only that she only wanted to do it if I thought we needed to. She's not against hearing me, but first she needs me to go to therapy and get control of my \"anger issues\". I said I don't meet the definition of anger issues. She said I did.\n\n\n\nThat was 3 months ago. In that time, I've seen therapists and all of them suggest cutting her off and moving on. We've been friends for the last 10 years and she's the cornerstone of one of my main friend groups. WIBTA if I did what I said in the title?",

      "scenario_description": "I (24M) have an identical twin. We're not close, but I thought we had basic mutual respect. That belief was tested.\n\nI grew up in a traditional Southern town & only began coming out in college, about five years ago. It's been slow, especially with family. But since moving to DC in '23 for school/work, I've felt more comfortable living authentically.\n\nAfter moving, I met my boyfriend (26M), & we've been together 2yrs. Over time, I've introduced him to friends and family when I felt safe.\n\nCut to Nov. '24: I was home for the holidays & told my twin & his fianceé about my bf. They seemed happy for me. While staying with them, wedding details arose, & they asked if I'd be bringing a date. I said yes, my bf. My twin had gone to bed, but his fianceé said, \"While there are pros and cons, it's up to you if you want to bring him.\" That felt like a green light. My twin constantly deferred to her on decisions, so I didn't think I needed to double-check.\n\n5 months passed, my bf & I had spent $1,300 on travel (flights, hotel, etc.). 3 weeks before the wedding, I mentioned on a call with my brother that we were all set. His tone shifted: \"Oh, is BF actually coming?\"\n\nI reminded him of the convo with his fianceé. He said she never gave me permission & accused me of making it up. Then said, \"We can't allow your bf to come. We worry how Dad's side will react.\"\n\nI offered to call Dad on the spot. He dodged, saying he'd check with his fianceé (despite just saying it was his decision.) An hour later, no change. I was still invited-ALONE, still expected to buy a groomsman-match suiting (even though I wasn't in the party), & show up smiling.\n\nThat's when I snapped. I asked, \"If I didn't invite your fianceé to my wedding, would you still come?\" He couldn't answer & ended the call after some harsh words. \n\nTrying to make things right, I came out to my dad (which I feared for years) to explain the situation. He was surprisingly indifferent & even said uninviting my bf was extreme. He offered to talk to extended family. I thought I was removing the main obstacle. \n\nWeeks later, my twin called again. He now claimed our friends would be \"weirded out\" (So the excuse shifted) I said, \"If my bf's not invited, I'm not coming.\" He didn't budge.\n\nHere's the kicker: days later, my dad told me the fianceé admitted she did give me permission but changed her mind when she remembered \"who would be there.\" She denied this to my twin. Also, one of her bridesmaids is openly gay and brought her gf, but, according to the fianceé, \"she's not part of the family,\" so it's different.\n\nSo I didn't go. I'm still wondering if I made the wrong call. My absence was noticed. I got texts asking where I was. My mom had to explain it repeatedly. So instead of avoiding attention, my absence became the story. My relationship with my twin is dead, & some family ties now feel fragile.\n\nPart of me wonders, should I have sucked it up & gone solo, just to preserve bonds that shaped my early life?\n\nSo, AITA for skipping the wedding?",

      "scenario_description": "My family is religious and my brother happens to be on the extreme side like most brothers are. They needed me to wear the religious scarf head covering. They and specifically my brother (pretty sure he convinced them and honed the idea in) want to be able to show everyone the photos without feeling shame or having females stand out; especially because every other female is already wearing it.\n\nI've had countless arguments before to finally be able to take it off completely. It was hectic. They tried to compel me to wear it by saying it's only a few hours and just a couple of photos. All of which I disagreed to. I just ended up not going.\n\nI didn't hear the end of it until like a day later where everyone completely ignored me. It's been a while. This isn't a first and I'm used to it, but it's getting to me. I persevere past it until they feel like conversing again but honestly.. I feel like I messed up a bit. They kept telling me I acted childish, made them ashamed, ruined the wedding, created not-so-fond memories, etc. I think it's mainly because even my closest family member started telling me how I ruined a special moment that doesn't happen often.\n\nI just don't agree with most of the things they do and I have to put up with it constantly; them forcing their practices on me is just annoying. They're not the kind of people I would give up things for anymore. It sucks having a religious family. Should I apologise?",

One of them with close relatives, and the other with friends/colleagues. I have a large family and we thought for a long time about who to invite from my side.\n\nAs a result, we decided that we would invite my grandmother, grandfather, aunt and her husband, mother and father. My parents divorced when I was 3. So we decided that we would not invite my father's 4th wife and my mother's second husband. Firstly, so as not to embarrass them, and secondly, because these people appeared in my life not so long ago and I am not connected with them. \n\nWhen I sent my father an invitation and said that we were inviting him, but without his wife, he replied that I should have consulted with him and that he refuses to go without his wife and \"you act stupid\". At the same time, my mother's husband himself said that he would not go, because \"he has a living father, I did not raise him, what should I do there if only relatives gather there\".\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My son has just had his 2nd birthday and we had a party for his friends from playgroup, my neighbour messaged me after the party saying 'the cherry on the cake' to all the shit going on in her life was that I didn't invite her autistic 8 year old son to his toddler party. \n\nShe's made me feel really guilty like I'm the reason for her upset.\n\nHer son is non verbal and smacks himself in the face if over stimulated. I didn't invite as it was a toddler party with only 5 2-3 year olds. \n\nMy living room isn't very big and I know her son is sensitive to loud noises and thought with all the screaming and fighting it wouldn't be a good idea. He also has to blow out candles even if its not his birthday, which, in my opinion isn't fair and would take focus off my boy.\n\nHe doesn't share toys and, in previous experiences, not even let my son play with his own toys in his own home, and even though the other children were fighting over toys, the parents, including mysel, were stopping snatching and inforcing sharing, even if it caused a tantrum.\n\nI am getting mixed reviews from people around me and I still personally didn't think it would be a good idea but she's made me feel like I was wrong for it.\n\nThank you for all or insights.. \n\nUpdate:-\nSince the party we had a little get together and the 2 toddlers were fighting and screaming about sharing his new toys, constantly trying to stop arguments and the neighbours son came along aswell, when ever the screaming started, it was as I feared the loud noises were too much, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere for the neighbours boy, covering his ears,  sprinting out into the communal gardens, as if he was trying to escape. It started off quietly, but then, as the toddlers got tired, it leveled up gradually. \n",

      "scenario_description": "Hey guys, I am getting married next week Friday, but I sent out my invitations about two weeks ago. On the invitation I put the white at the bottom in capital letters but two days later my mother-in-law texted me and showed me a picture of the dress that she was planning on wearing the base was white, but it had black polkadots. Honestly, I told her that I didn’t think that she should wear that dress because the base was white and I feel like it would honestly look a little bit weird, especially since the invitation said no white. Today two weeks later I come to my family’s house and everybody is showing me their dresses my cousin comes out first and she is wearing the tightest and most revealing dress. The back is literally all cut out and it looks like a white dress with shimmers on it but in reality, it’s like a super light gray, but almost white , even my sister told me that she thought it was white.  I told her I thought it was too close to white. Whatever my next cousin comes out and her dress is a white base but with blue flowers like blue flower stamps. I asked everybody if they read invitation because I clearly stated that no white but everybody was telling me that I was over exaggerating and that a base white dress is fine as long as it has other stuff on it, and they also let me know they did not read the invitation. My cousin ended up telling me “are you going to be choosing everybody’s clothes or was since you have something to say about everybody’s clothes.”But honestly, I just think that people should’ve read the invitation, but I do kind of feel bad because now they made me feel like I’m over exaggerating. What do you guys think? Am I a bridezilla ? \n\n ",

      "scenario_description": "Hi 24M. I know this needs context, so I'll try and make it simple. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are just getting to the point of taking showers with each other while we're at each others places. The current problem I'm having is that I was on the toilet doing my business, when I was done I did the required paper work and then washed my hands. That all sounds normal to me. My girlfriend was in the bathroom with me, do to us getting ready to take a shower together. \n\nShe watched me wash my hands and asked me what I was doing, then scolded me for it. He logic was that since we were getting in the shower, washing my hands was pointless. I thought she was joking, so I laughed and said that was gross. I'm not touching anything with my soiled hands like that. She interpreted that as me calling her gross. \n\nSo I had to ask, does she always get right into the shower after using the toilet without washing them first? Apparently she doesn't wash her hand. She just gets right into the shower. Now I'm somehow an asshole because I don't want to spread my poop germs around my bathroom more than what flushing already does. \n\nNow it's turned into an argument. We didn't shower together and instead of having a nice day like we planed, I drove her home.\n\nI don't get it, who doesn't wash their hand immediately after wiping? If I'm home, I don't even pull my pants up until I wash my hands. \n\nI asked a few guy friends about it and they're all on my side, so I thought it might be a girl thing. So I called the only girls in my life i can ask such a stupid question. First i tried my older sister 38F, to which i got scolded for even considering not washing my hands. The lady practically raised me. Then I tried my younger sister 22F, she was on my girlfriends side. So I don't know.\n\n  \nAITA for washing my hands after using the bathroom even though I was getting in the shower anyways? ",

      "scenario_description": "(I'll refer to him as Jim for privacy reasons) A few days ago I mentioned to Jim that I didn't have time to pick up water from the store. He offered to bring a case over to my house on his way home. I said sure that's fine. The next day (yesterday) he comes by with the water. He texted me an hour before he arrived but never texted me when he actually arrived to my house.\n\nRandomly I hear loud knocking on my bedroom window, I didn't know who it was and felt kinda scared so I yelled \"Hello who is it\" and he said it's Jim. I go to open the front door and immediately I told him \"Please don't knock on my bedroom window again, it honestly scares me so just text or call me when you arrive next time.\" \n\nIt really did stress me out that he knocked on my window so loudly. So I did slightly raise my voice when telling him this. He said okay he understood and I said okay thanks goodbye and I went back inside. He texted me an hour later saying he wouldn't come over anymore because he felt unwelcomed. (True because I have never actually invited him to my house) \n\nAm I the asshole for speaking to him like that? \n\n(I've been seeing this guy for the last 3 or 4 months. I'm trying to take it slow and haven't made anything official yet. We've only been on 2 dates but I see him multiple times a week because we are also co workers. He's never been inside my house or invited)\n\n",

Michael grew up in the conservative Bible Belt with an older brother (John) and a younger sister (Chelsea). She’s 17. So you know Michaels parents totally 100% accepted him for being gay. NOT. His parents were livid and he moved far away from them as possible and has kept minimal contact except to keep up with his sister.\n\nNow onto the story. I work as a CNA and work long hour night shifts. Michael works part time for right now as he was let go in 2020 during the pandemic.\n\nI come home from a long night of work to find Chelsea sitting on our couch with a cup of tea, and Michael sitting across from her. I ask her what she’s doing here as she’s supposed to be three states away. She says “my parents kicked me out.” I ask her why and she says because she’s pregnant.\n\nShe got knocked up by some head honcho quarterback and he wants nothing to do with the baby, and her parents plan for her was to either. Wait two months til she turns 18 and then get married to her piss poor baby daddy. Chelsea didn’t want to do that so they kicked her out.\n\nMichael looked solemn in her explaining everything like he was coming up with a plan. He pulled me aside and said “we should raise the baby” I told him absolutely not, because 1) we can’t raise a baby 2) I don’t want children, they aren’t my cup of tea.\n\nNow Michael is upset because he wants to help his sister out. Chelsea doesn’t really feel upset but I’m not sure. She’s at least asking if she can stay with us awhile until she gets her own place, which I don’t mind.\n\n",

I had Taylor with my College GF, we broke up when Taylor was just a baby (under a year old). We coparented well together. Now that Taylor is older, she comes here when she wants but primarily stays with her mom since she's closer to her school/ friends. I got married to my now wife 8 years ago, we now have 2 daughters together. Taylor’s always gotten along great with my wife and her little sisters. \n\nMe, my wife and all 3 girls went to Disney world for a few days. Taylor has always been a huge Belle fan. First day at Disney I had some work to do so I got up early and got ready and went to the lobby while the girls got ready. When I went back up to the room my youngest 2 were dressed in princess dresses and crowns. While my oldest had on a very what I would call belle themed outfit. When I saw the younger 2 I said you two look just like princesses. My youngest asked what about Taylor, Taylor in the last few years has been over the cute pet names. So I said I think Taylor is a little too old to be a princess but she's very pretty. Taylor said thanks but sounded a little off. I didnt think anything of it. \n\nWe had a good day, Taylor was distant with me but having fun with my wife and her sisters. I figured I would ask her when we got back to the hotel. Well I got a long angry text from my ex wife, saying Taylor had texted her that I called her sisters princesses but not her and said she was too old to be a princess and that really hurt her feelings I guess. I reminded my ex that Taylor has hated cute pet names for years now. My ex said considering we’re at Disney and Taylor was in a Belle themed outfit I should have thought that she might have wanted to be a princess for the day. My ex said I was being a oblivious AH, I tried talking to Taylor but she doesn't want to talk about it and hasnt talked to me much. My wife thinks I could have handled the situation better and made it up to Taylor. I don't think assuming my teen daughter wouldn't want to be called a princess is being an AH. ",

I’ve had family and friends texting me asking why I won’t do it, and my parents insisting I should because it’s not about me. I felt it was a perfectly reasonable decision to decline, but after so many people disagreeing with me, I’m not so sure anymore\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "Am I the asshole for telling My husband that I really don’t want to homeschool his kids? We have four kids, 2 teens and a 10 yo girl and 1 yo boy, one teen and the 10 yo are his from a previous woman, our 1yo is ours together and my teen daughter from my ex. He told me he really wants me to homeschool both his schoolage kids, his 10 yo is a handful, we have a mostly good relationship now but the first couple years was bumpy and she still has problems following rules and instructions, so I can imagine teaching her anything would put a serious wedge between us and his teen son doesn’t listen to me at all, he’s very disobedient. The school year when they go to school (very nice private school btw) it’s a nice break for me and I’m a sahm and I also help with his business on top of taking care of all house chores and cooking/shopping and the kids plus their homework and taking them to all after school and summer activities. I think I would lose my mind If I had to add homeschooling to my plate. Am I wrong for telling him I need that break each day away from the kids?\n\nEDIT: to answer any questions, he wants me to HS to avoid bad influence, but they have been going to school their entire school age lives, they have already been influenced, that ship sailed. \n\nI am 100% not qualified to teach, nor do I have the patience. When his daughter fell behind in math I would help her with homework, and even with all distractions off, she could not focus on the task and would bounce around, ask unrelated questions and not pay attention to what I am teaching. So I can imagine teaching her would be a nightmare for both of us. \n\nI get allowance each month plus bills paid, access to card and bank account, so our marriage outside of him bugging me about HS is great, he takes good care of us, but the fact that he’s asked so many times and I have told him that me teaching them would hurt their education and also our relationship plus the many other valid reasons and that still hasn’t deterred him makes me question if he truly sees everything I do and if it’s enough. I don’t want to be selfish, I would do anything for my kids and my family, but that also means putting my foot down on something that I know could be detrimental to them even if he doesn’t see it. ",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway also, English isn’t my first language, so sorry if anything sounds off. I just need an outside opinion.\n\nMy friend Beth recently turned 18 and had a birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant. There were about 15 or 20 of us. She is really close with two girls, Lia and Kat. They have been best friends for years and have this very intense, no-boundaries type of friendship. They go through each other’s phones, eat off each other’s plates, that kind of thing.\n\nI met them last year when uni started. I am not used to that. Even with friends I have known forever, I ask before I touch their stuff or try their food. \nThe trio teases me for this habit & they say I am too formal.\n\nAt dinner, Lia, told everyone to order whatever they wanted and that it was all covered. I asked if she was sure and she said, “Me saying it is the same as Beth saying it.” It felt a bit off, but I let it go.\n\nI just ordered a Coke and shared some of what was on the table. I asked Lia if I could get a beer and she gave me a weird look and said, “Idk” So I asked Beth, and she said I could but that her parents do not like alcohol, so I would need to pay for it myself. I said that was not a problem but still was getting dirty looks from Lia (maybe she wanted a beer too but didn’t want to pay idk) so ended up not ordering it to avoid more awkwardness.\n\nMeanwhile, Lia and Kat kept ordering a lot of sushi. I love sushi too, but for a group that size, it did not seem practical. I just ate whatever was already there.\n\nLater, I saw Beth sitting with my friend Millie and she looked really upset. Her mom had called and was angry because the bill was much higher than expected. Beth said Lia went overboard with the ordering and now she had to deal with it. I felt really bad said maybe next time she could plan a set menu or do the ordering herself. We stayed with her, comforted her, and tried to help her feel better. Lia was across the room laughing acting like nothing happened.\n\nThe bill got paid and we all left. Millie and I just gave each other that look like, “That was wild,” and moved on.\n\nA few days later, Lia sent me angry texts. She said Millie and I were stirring up drama and trying to come between her and Beth and ruined her rep infront of Beth’s parents. She also said that if we felt so bad for Beth, we should send her mom the money.\n\nI was honestly shocked. We did not say anything bad about Lia. We just tried to be kind when Beth was upset.\n\nI told her no. Respectfully, we are broke uni students & we were not the ones telling people to order freely.\n\nNow everything is awkward and tense and I hate it. I want to sort it out, but I do not think I should be blamed for all of it right? Sorry if this all sounds like petty high school drama.\n\nShould I have just paid to keep the peace?\n\nTL;DR: Friend’s birthday dinner got out of hand. I barely ordered anything, comforted her when she got upset, and now another friend says I caused drama and should help pay. I said no. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "EDITED TO CLARIFY. \nMy husband (35m) and I (33f) are expecting our second child this summer. We have the c section date schedule, so like, it’s coming soon.. soon soon. With our first, my MIL stayed at our house to care for our three dogs and a cat while we were in the hospital having the first baby, also by c section. We were there 3 nights. This go around we still have the same house, same pets (minus two dogs, RIP the good boy and girl) add a toddler and are planning on leaving a day earlier since we have a better idea of what we’re doing. Initially she was game to stay at our house with our toddler (2.5m) and our pets, and she already took off work those days to be here…so we didn’t make any other plans. Now speaking with her. She’s trying to convince us that she needs to stay at her house with our toddler and we can just take the dog somewhere and we can pick both up the day we come home. I told my husband absolutely not. If that’s the game, then we will find some other family member who will either watch both at their house or who will stay here for both. We’re not even asking her to stay all day.. and the toddler goes to day care during the day. We’re just looking for someone to be here in the evenings for the dog to have company and be taken care of twice a day and so the toddler can stay in his house and routine. It’s literally two nights unless something goes wrong. AITA? \n\nAdditional info:\nDog is DOG reactive. Loves people. No bite history. No other dogs around. Only has health issues when severely stressed, but none for a while. Couch potato dog. \n\nMIL was happy to agree to this in November when  asked. Confirmed it again sometime in April, still happy to help and stay at our house. When told the date of c section, in 3 weeks, changed her mind while on the phone. We mentioned having FIL (they’re divorced) watch both. She doesn’t want that only wants GC. \n\nMILs house is not childproofed. No gates for steps and a dog that HAS bit toddler. Plus 3 cats that have also bit and scratched toddler. \n",

      "scenario_description": "I’ve (22f) posted here about my roommate (24f) before. She has always had issues contributing to the household, including buying things like toilet paper, dish soap, laundry detergent, etc. She also rarely does her dishes promptly or takes out the trash or other household chores, and struggles to pay utilities on time. Sometimes I even have to hound her for the rent. I felt bad at first because clearly she wasn’t equipped to live alone but I quickly got frustrated and became short with her. We were friends at first but not so much anymore after I’ve had to put up with her for this long. \n\nOur year long lease ended and we have been living month to month since then. Eventually she got a boyfriend. He lives with his parents but that hasn’t stopped her from spending most of her time at their house. I started seeing her less and less. \n\nA couple days into May I hadn’t seen her for maybe two weeks. I texted and called her to see when she was going to pay her share of rent (due on the 5th) but she basically ghosted me. I got in contact with her mom and eventually my roommate reached out to say she’s staying with her boyfriend’s family “for now” and doesn’t think she should be expected to pay rent for somewhere she’s not staying. I kindly asked if that meant she would be moving out but she didn’t respond. \n\nI paid rent myself, which was a huge unexpected expense. After that I decided I was done. I texted her over the course of May and June asking her to move her stuff out but she didn’t respond to me. Her mom kept promising me that her daughter would take care of it but she never once got back to me.\n\nAfter July started I recruited a couple friends to help me pack up the stuff in her room and donated most of it to Goodwill and the Salvation Army. I also asked the landlord to change the locks which he did. \n\nThe other evening she finally shows up and is mad that the locks have been changed. I told her she’s not living here and doesn’t pay rent so she has no reason to enter the apartment. She got even more upset and said that she was never moving out, she was just staying with him for the time being. She told me the situation didn’t work out so she planned to come back and live here again. I told her that she was already off the lease and it’s my rental now. She started crying and said she had nowhere else to go and I felt really bad. She asked if she could at least get some of her stuff, she needed some clean clothes and a shower. I told her that because she never told me she was coming back or made plans to move her stuff out, I donated everything that was in her room unless it looked precious or expensive and stored the rest in her closet. \n\nShe completely freaked out and threatened to call the police on me. She was inconsolable. She cried about how I even donated her dead grandmother’s wedding dress, which had been in a special box somewhere in her room. I apologized profusely because I did feel really bad but it all could have been avoided if she had tried to communicate with me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I told her by July I would start getting rid of things if she didn’t make plans to do it herself. Where I live, a unit is considered abandoned once they vacate and owe rent. The cost of the items being donated will determine how long I need to store them before getting rid of them. I asked her to make arrangements for her things beginning in early May, which she ignored. I emphasized in June that I would be donating her things by July, which she also ignored. Additionally, her mother was aware the whole time and promised me her daughter would take care of it by June 30th, which she didn’t. ",

      "scenario_description": "I 40m and my wife 39f have 3 great kids, 13m, 12f, and 9f. \n\nOur youngest daughter doesn't handle horror very well , she can only handle Scooby do and even that is sometimes too scary for her. But she of course wants to see scary stuff and throws temper tantrums when we say no. \n\nLast night my wife and our two older kids wanted to watch Alien and we figured we'd watch it after our youngest daughter was in bed ( since it's summer we've bumped her bedtime up to 9:30 ).\n\nAfter my wife and I put our daughter to bed we went downstairs to start the movie. After the movie had started our youngest daughter came down and asked what movie we were watching. We asked her why she wasn't in bed and she said she heard her sister mention that we were gonna watch a movie and asked if she could watch to. \n\nWe told her no because it was too scary for her but she kept insisting that she could handle it. I eventually firmly told her no but she kept insisting that she could handle it. \n\nSo I picked her up and carried her back to her bed, she screamed and protested the whole time saying \" no daddy I wanna watch the movie \"!\n\nWhen I tucked her back in bed she kept protesting saying it wasn't fair to have family movie time without her, that's when I said to her \" this is not family movie time this is a time for people who are big enough for scary movies and you're too little for scary movies \".\n\nShe said \" no daddy I'm big enough for scary movies \" and tried to get out of bed, thats when I raised my voice and firmly told her \" no your too little for scary movies and it is past your bedtime now if you get out of bed again your in trouble \"! \n\nI then tucked her back into bed and kissed her goodnight.\n\nThen we all watched the movie as planned, we could hear our daughter screaming and having a tantrum from upstairs for a while but we ignored it and it did stop. \n\nI thought i handed it fine until today when my wife came to me very upset with me for how I handled it. \n\nShe said it would've been better to just let her watch a movie that was appropriate for her with us and then put her to bed and watch Alien because then she wouldn't have felt excluded. I disagreed because our daughter knew it was past her bedtime. But my wife still thinks I didn't handle it right. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

Sounds perfectly reasonable that they have feelings about this.\n\nThe goal should be to include them and make whatever you are doing as boring as possible so that the kids lose interest. Change the narrative to they can stay up to watch movies if they choose to do so and they are included in the family. But it’s their choice to leave the activity.\n\nWhen our kids come to the loungeroom, we switch on a slow paced documentary with a narrator who has a relatively flat voice. The rule is that they can stay up and watch tv with the adults but they have to watch what the adults are watching.\n\nThe kids last about 10 minutes before they take themselves to bed. They love the documentaries about ancient Egypt but they can’t seem to keep their eyes open!",

      "scenario_description": "Hi my name is Laura and I am 19 I have a best friend let's say he's name is Lary and he has a gf let's call Ann both in their 20s.\nSo these two have been together for 3 months now and they like being freaky everywhere which to be honest doesn't really concern me, it's not my job to be involved to tha.But I thinks it's my job to get involved when they are doing it right next to me.So let me start by saying that whenever we both stay over at Ann's and we go to sleep they always get freaky with sound and all.So to give you some background Ann's room is like a hotel room there are two beds next to each other but not to close like one meter distance and they sleep together ofc. I have told Lary that I don't feel comfortable with them doing it right next to me but his excuse was you don't have a say in what we are doing since you are sleeping. I usually wake up and I must stay quiet  until they are finished because they treat me like I don't exist and this got us to an argument resulting in me stop going to Ann's for sleepovers ,since it makes me extremely uncomfortable. Now to tha main problem in 2 days we have agreed that we will go to a club and then thay will crush at my place for a few hours and I don't have a problem with that. My problem is that they want to get freaky in my house. The think is Lary has been making snide remarks all week about me leaving MY room and leaving them alone and I can sleep on the couch that's how they think of it. But I feel discasted only with the thought of something like that happening anywhere in my house especially from other people but I know they wonk care and try to guilt trip me especially Ann who always puts him in the mood its not like he refuses but you get it.I feel extremely disrespected because they can accept that I don't want this to happen in my house. WIBTA if they try to initiate and I kick em both out in the middle of the night? \nAm I overreacting when it's make me uncomfortable hearing Them right next me doing it ?\nIs he right  for saying since I am sleeping I don't have a say?\nI NEED some outside perspective and some advise on how to handle things \nWIBTA?",

      "scenario_description": "So my (f31) ex husband (m33) just broke up in March of this year. I won’t go into details about it but he sprung it on me quite suddenly. We just bought a house together a little over a year ago and we’ve both been living there in the meantime while I look for a new place to live and our lawyers figure out the financial details. I’m not particularly attached to the house so I don’t mind moving but it takes time. \n\nI currently have one 14 year old chihuahua mix who was my dog before I met my ex husband so I will be keeping the dog with me.  Ex loves dogs and spoke a lot about wanting to get another dog. He even showed me specific other dogs he had been considering just a few weeks before he dumped me. He now tells me the one of the reasons he wanted another dog so bad was that he could have a dog that was just his. \n\nHe recently sent me a message asking if it would be okay for him to get another dog soon, while I’m still in the house. I told him no because he works quite a bit and I don’t have a day job (I’m an artist) so I’d be the one at home all day taking care of this new dog. I also said it was unfair to my dog to make him socialize with a new dog all of a sudden, especially since we won’t be staying here. My dog is old and not super friendly to other dogs. \n\nI do feel a little bad that ex still helps with my dog but him and my dog have lived together for like 8 years so of course my dog still loves him and asks for attention from him. The dog doesn’t know what’s going on. It’s also not like he needs very much care. Ex just gives him food in the morning and lets him outside a few times and lets him snuggle with him. \n\nEx said that he didn’t expect this whole divorce/me moving out process to take so long and tried to make me feel guilty by saying a lot of the dogs he looks at are at shelters where they’ll be put down soon if they’re not adopted. \n\nAm I the asshole for just telling him to wait and not look at new dogs until I’m gone?",

I had my baby in the car (3 months ), after the crash baby was absolutely hysterical, of course she would be, my friend then tried to scramble in the mix of it to take her out of her carseat. I do admit I may have said it harshly to not remove baby from their carseat until first responders got to us. The car was not on fire and we weren't in any mortal danger. \n\nOn a normal day anytime my baby gets to the point of hysteria I soothe them, hug them, rock them, etc. That was a once in blue moon occurrence I didn't. I kept trying to shush and soothe baby from the seat but obviously she was scared and wanted her mama to hold her. \n\nAt the hospital both my friend and I got the all clear and we were waiting on baby to be cleared, my friend went off on me telling me I'm a bad mom for not removing baby from the carseat. I simply explained to her, it was better for baby to stay in the seat incase there was spinal damage, the seat keeps the spine aligned and removing the baby from the carseat would cause further injury if there was already one. \n\nShe kept berating me, I was frustrated already and I told her when she has her own and god forbid they get into a crash she can yank her kid out of the carseat and do as she pleases. She got quite and said I'm an asshole for bringing it up because she has trouble conceiving, she has PCOS,  and may not be able to carry a pregnancy to term.  \n\nIdt I'm the asshole for bringing up a hypothetical situation or I don't know if my frustration got the best of me and I was insensitive but AITA for making that statement?\n",

      "scenario_description": "I 23f have an older brother, Drew, 26m who is getting married at the end of this summer. To say it lightly me and his fiance, Lacy, 25f, do not get along. She's very stuck up and has made some snide comments to me and my younger brother, Max, 16m. For context Max has always been the black sheep of the family. He is very academically and artistically talented but my father and mother are disappointed in his lack of sports (cliche I know), not to mention they've favored my sister, his twin, Caroline, 16f. Max and Lacy were civil for awhile but I guess I haven't seen them speak in a long time for reasons unknown to me.\n\nThe problem occurred last night when I was asking Lacy about the wedding and how the planning was going. She started telling me her seating chart and showing me what she had planned, I was looking at the chart and Max's name  was nowhere to be found. I don't love Lacy but I'm not going to assume the worst of her, so I asked her where Max's name was and she got suddenly quiet. \" He's not going to be there\", she said. \"You mean not in the wedding party?\", I ask. \"No, he's not invited\", she said it so calmly I'd assume she was talking about the weather. I kept asking her why she wouldn't invite him but invited Caroline. She just said that she feels Caroline is more mature because she is a girl.\n\nThis wedding isn't going to be child free, Lacy has stated this multiple times. I have many little cousins who are being invited, since family is very important to us. Not inviting Max makes no sense. He is a very nice kid, and very mature for his age. Much more mature than Caroline. He never causes problems but like I mentioned earlier, there are some big issues with him not following Drew's and my dad's footsteps in football. I know Lacy is very desperate for my family's approval so maybe outlining Max is the way to do it for her but I have a feeling there's something more to it.\n\nAfter what Lacy said about not inviting Max, I stood up and started yelling at her for not including Max.She kind of just ignored what I was saying but when I escalated, Drew came over. As he was walking over she started to cry and make a bigger scene about it. Drew knelt down to comfort her and gave me dirty looks. Once she was inside he turned to me and started yelling at me about being rude to her, when she is under so much stress from planning the wedding and trying to get my family to like her. I understand that my family is closed knit and kind of not welcoming to newcomers but that doesn't excuse her behavior and I told my brother so. I asked him why he didn't want to invite Max and he just told me to stay out of it (Classic move of him). He called me an asshole for treating Lacy like that, then walked out. We haven't spoken since last night.\n\nI understand that yelling at her was a bit much and i could have handled the situation differently, but i am sick of seeing Max being left out and treated badly. I don't want to fight with Drew, but I'm standing my ground for Max's sake, Max also doesn't know about any of this yet and I'm hesitant to tell him. My parents have stayed out of it so far but Drew is still set on being mad at me. AITA?\"",

      "scenario_description": "I (28M) recently started a new job in tech that pays really well. Honestly, it's the most money I've ever made in my life, and it's completely changed how I live. I grew up in a single parent household, and my older sister (32F) was a huge part of my life when we were kids. Our mum worked two jobs, so my sister kind of took on a parental role when she was still just a teenager. She cooked for me, helped me with homework, made sure I got to school on time. I’ve always been thankful for that.\n\nThe issue is, her adult life has been pretty messy. She’s never been great with money. She's bounced from job to job, tried a bunch of different \"business ideas\" that didn’t go anywhere, and constantly asks people to loan her money or invest in things. She doesn’t have any savings and has borrowed from our cousins, our mum, and even old friends. A lot of those relationships are strained now.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, she called me and said she was being evicted. She asked if I could give her $5,000 to help her stay in her place. She said she'd pay me back as soon as things \"picked up.\" That’s something she’s said before.\n\nI told her that I couldn’t give her that kind of money right now. I’ve been saving up for a house deposit and trying to be smart with my finances. She got really upset and told me that I wouldn’t even be where I am if it weren’t for her raising me. She said she gave up her childhood for me and that I’m basically abandoning her now that I’ve \"made it.\"\n\nI tried to explain that I appreciate everything she did when we were kids, but I also can’t keep giving out money when I know there's a good chance I’ll never see it again. She hung up on me.\n\nNow our mum is texting me saying my sister is sleeping on her couch and that she’s in a really tough spot. She says I’m turning my back on the one person who was always there for me.\n\nI feel guilty. I really do. But I also feel like my sister brings these situations on herself and expects other people to fix them. I’m not sure what the right thing to do is anymore.\n\nAITA for not helping her this time?",

      "scenario_description": "I (F25) am a bridesmaid in the wedding of a good friend (F27) this fall. She had us all plan to be free the first weekend of August for her bachelorette party, promising we’d do something fun but lower cost (relative to the crazy destination bachelorettes people plan these days). This weekend, she and her maid of honor sent out what they decided on for the trip, which was to spend the night at an indoor waterpark resort. They wanted us 12 girls to get 6 rooms (2 in each) for one night, spending two days there total.\n\nAs soon as I saw the message in the groupchat, I knew the trip wouldn’t be fun for me due to my size. I am about 5’7” and 270 pounds, and the maximum weight for a single rider on the majority of slides is 250. There are a few 300 pound maximums, or 2-person rides with 400 pound maximums, but the idea of standing in my bathing suit, being weighed to make sure I can go, makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI know I’m overweight and need to lose some, but insecurity isn’t the main thing holding me back. I’d happily go on a beach vacation and rock a bathing suit the whole time. It’s the combination of the bathing suit, weigh-ins, and fact that I am too big to participate in many of the rides that makes it seem not fun to me. Because I couldn’t do the same things as all the other girls, (there are a few heavier girls in the party, but I’m by far the biggest and I think the only one who exceeds 250 pounds), I think it would leave me feeling bad all weekend instead of upbeat and excited for the bride.\n\nI told my friend politely that I didn’t think I would be attending, and she got very upset, saying that she asked us to reserve the weekend months in advance and that she worked hard to keep costs down. I told her that I agree and appreciate all of that, but that I don’t think I’d be a ton of fun on this particular trip. She pushed and when I elaborated, she said that I could float in the lazy river/hot tub or swim in a standard pool or drink at the bar while the other girls rode slides and that I shouldn’t let my weight hold me back, especially from something so important to her. I still feel like it would be uncomfortable and a waste of money for me, as I wouldn’t truly be able to have the same experience. WIBTA for not going?",

      "scenario_description": "Sorry, this is long but needs context.  My wife and I had a 2nd child and my wife decided she wanted to be a SAHM for at least a year which she did.  We also have a 6 year old who she wanted to keep home since she would not be going into work.  After 18 months she decided to go back to work.  My work schedule for the last ten years has been 6am-2pm.  She asked me if I could adjust my hours so that I could drop our oldest off at school in the morning and she would drop our youngest off at a daycare down the street that she passes on her way to work.  I agreed to adjust my hours but told her that at certain times I would still have to go in early and she would have to handle both kids.  When I take my oldest to school I have to come back home and switch vehicles to my company truck because she is too small to ride in the front seat and it has no back seats.  This adds time on to the commute as well that I wasnt planning on.  Initially I thought I would be able to get to work by 7:30 but I quickly found out I wasn't able to make it in until 8:15-8:30am.  Rush hour traffic killed my normal commute time.  Everyone else in my field starts at 6am.  Sometimes we work in teams and me coming in late holds them up. I work in a trade.  I can also be scheduled for testing and inspections at 7am as thats when our inspectors start.  Over the summer both kids go to the same daycare.  I pack their lunches and get the oldest dressed and ready in the morning.  My wife wakes our youngest up 10 mins before they leave for daycare.  All she has to do is put them both in the car and drive them to the same daycare.  I tried getting back close to my old schedule by leaving the house at 6:30am and still getting the oldest ready to make it to work by 7am as I have really fallen behind at work by getting there late and leaving early these last 5 months so I don't get stuck in traffic on my way to pick up the kids from daycare.  My wife thinks I am being an asshole and unreasonable because I am trying to get close to my old schedule for the summer.  Her job doesn't start until 7:45-8am.  Her commute is only 25 mins.  Am i the asshole?  My job is what covers our benefits which are some of the best you can get and I make almost 3 times what she makes.  I don't want to risk my job.  Am I being unreasonable?  Also, my supervisors have no clue i wasn't starting until after 8am some to most days.  They thought I was usually in by 7am or 7:30am on the rare occasion.",

      "scenario_description": " I(15M)bought a new Nintendo switch. A week ago my brother(23M)and his gf(23F)stopped by to let their kid(4M)play since he has a lot of toys here. I was taking a shower when they got here so I didn’t know they were here. My switch was on the livingroom couch charging.\n\nNow for context their son has really bad behavior problems. He flips out over everything and will scream and cry for hours. He also loves to break things for no reason. So overall a bad kid.\n\nfrom what my brother told me the kid had picked it up and one of his parents (not sure who) was trying to take it from him since he’s rough with stuff and they didn’t want him to break it. This set off the kid so he started screaming and crying. I heard this part while I was in the shower but I didn’t think anything of it since he’s always throwing tantrums. I figured my switch would be safe cus it’s my apartment and I should be able to leave stuff out without fear of it getting broken.\n\nSo after I got out of the shower I walked into the living room and my brother has my switch next to him. Said switch has the screen all cracked and one of the joycons disconnected. obviously I’m pissed and I ask what happened. Apparently the kid got mad that they wouldn’t let him have it so he grabbed it and ran into the kitchen and threw it down and started stomping on it. Which is pretty on brand because he does the same thing with phones or other electronics when he can’t have them. This kid is really heavy but I didn’t think heavy enough to the point the screen on my switch wouldn’t work anymore. And I’m not sure what happened to the joycon but it won’t slide on all the way I think something got bent?\n\nI grabbed my switch and went to my room to text my mom because she was at work. So my mom calls me a while later on one of her breaks and is flipping out about it. As she should because that was 300$ of my own money. So she hangs up and calls my brother and is flipping out on him about it. I was still in my room so idk what exactly she said. They ended up leaving with their kid.\n\nThen my mom came home and suddenly her attitude has completely switched. She’s telling me that she’ll buy me a new one when she gets the money and how the kid didn’t mean it and he didn’t know. And I’m still pissed so I ask her why my brother or his gf can’t replace it and she makes excuses about how my brother doesn’t work and he doesn’t have alot of money. THE REASON HE DOESNT HAVE MONEY IS CUS HES A BUM AND WONT GET A JOB AND SELLS WEED. His girlfriend works at a fucking taco truck so obviously between the two of them they can barely afford their expenses. They’re constantly asking my mom for money to cover the bills.\n\nnow we’re at a standstill. My mom is making excuses for why my brother or his gf can’t buy me a new one. They could easily buy me a new one if my brother stopped being a bum and got a job.\n\nIk I’m not in the wrong but I wanna see Reddit flame my family.",

      "scenario_description": "Recently, my BIL (husband’s brother) made the decision to not bring his 9 year old daughter (husband’s niece) to our wedding the day of. We were made aware she wasn’t going to be there until last minute from my MIL citing that she had to stay in school. Bearing in mind she's 9, well behaved, and the wedding was at the end of the school year. My husband was devastated as he adores his niece.\n\nMy husband's SIL (brother's wife) also didn't turn up to the ceremony. We were made aware of this a week before the wedding after we had been planning it for over 1 year. His mother allegedly made the decision as his SIL had been having troubles sleeping with her new 7 M.O. We respected this, if this was his SIL's wishes. We just found it odd it never came from her, especially since she's okay with asking my husband for things from time to time.\n\nOne of my BIL’s helped my husband set up for our proposal, but when it was done, he just walked to the car, didn't congratulate us, make any conversation, or make any eye contact once we thanked him. The next time we saw his family, no one said a word to us and spoke amongst themselves—it was as if we never got engaged. We were so confused and hurt.\n\nMy husband was also hurt at his bucks, his brother's didn't speak to him, even after we covered their share of the event. They also didn't say anything to him on the wedding day, they came to our home for photos (it was a 1 minute walk from their house). Our wedding was local to avoid any issues. At the wedding, they refused to acknowledge me, and none of them wished us congrats, even after. I understand that weddings can be chaotic for couples, but ours was very small, and I stood next to them multiple times whilst my husband said a few things, but again, not a word until now. We couldn't really see any of his SIL's at the wedding either and didn’t want to focus on it.\n\nI've known these people for over a decade, and they aren't the best at conversations or small talk. I will sometimes get a 'hello' under breaths, and some small talk when I try. They, however, don't have any issues conversing amongst themselves, their wives, and each other. Nowadays there isn’t a ‘hello’ or a look in my direction. We previously invited them to dinner, cooked, initiated conversation, been polite, civil, and have gone to every family event his mother forces us to go to with no hesitation.\n\nAITA if I don't go to their new baby's dedication we just got invited to this weekend? I don't want to not be there to support my husband's new niece, and nor do I want to withhold him from being in her life—it's not the kid's fault. But being around them is just so exhausting and painful. We will be there for birthday parties, if invited, of course, to not send a really strong message that might indicate we don’t care for the kid. But his mother is now breathing down our necks asking if we're going to be there, and a part of me wants to be petty for how they made us feel at our wedding.",

Maybe you dismissed an incident as being no big deal when it very much was a big deal. Maybe you made a faux pas that people are afraid to tell you about. Maybe they simply dislike you.\n\nThis reeks of MIL forcing them to attend your events and invite you to things because family… while not being honest with you about their feelings because she doesn’t want to lose you.\n\nYTA if you don’t attend  this event because everyone is doing their utmost to be polite, civil and play happy families. You have a responsibility to do the same… UNLESS you are brave enough to clear the air and listen to some grievances (which quite frankly may be petty so be prepared).",

      "scenario_description": "My sister does this thing where she'll just say something she wants with the expectation that someone will do it for her. For example, if she wants the AC turned on, instead of asking someone to turn it on for her, she'll keep repeating things like \"Oh, isn't it super warm in here?\", \"Does anyone else feel really hot?\" or \"I heard that today is a super hot day!\" and if someone asks her if she wants the AC on, she'll reply with \"No, no, I'm good! But if *you're* hot then you should turn it on!\"   \n  \nAnyways, last weekend it was my birthday so my family and I went out to celebrate. During the meal, she kept making comments implying that she wanted another cocktail, but wouldn't order it. The waitress even came by and asked if we needed anything, but she didn't order a drink even when we all did. I could tell she was agitated at that point, but it was my birthday so I just ignored her. \n\nWhen we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we \"let\" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying \"no\" to the waitress because her family should've \"taken care of her\" (her words, not mine). \n\nThe three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.
