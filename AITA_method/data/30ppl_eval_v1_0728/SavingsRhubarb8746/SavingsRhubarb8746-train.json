      "scenario_description": "Hello, I (M22) have been driving my sister (F24, who doesnt want to drive because she \"doesnt need it\") almost everywhere thusfar. Whenever she needs something, she will always let me a maximum of 2 days prior, even when she herself has known it for much longer. Some rides only take about 40 mins total, but others take up at least 6 hours of my day. I usually try to make it work, because she is my sister. \n\nThe big problem for me is that she is always late. Whenever we settle on a time, she always ends up being late. I always send her a reminder at the day itself when Ill be there, and even call her 5 minutes before arriving. Despite that she is always late. At the last instance, earlier this week, I told her that my gf had a pretty important meeting so we were tight on time. Despite mentioning it she still ended up being late. \n\nTonight, she messaged me again, asking if she could drive along to the family gathering next week, I told her that it is fine, as long as she is on time. She responded saying that I always mention it and I dont have to waste my energy sending a message because she will be on time (as she always says). The way she told me that made me feel like I was just some better public transport for her, and to help her view I told her that if she is late, Ill leave without her this time. \n\nAITA for planning on going to the gathering without her if she is late?",

      "scenario_description": "1 year ago I (30F) received a panicked call from my sister Sally (35F) because my parents house was going into foreclosure. My parents had stopped living in that house in 2014 and let my oldest sister Ann (40F) and her family live there, with the understanding that she would pay the mortgage. My parents are immigrants and had called Sally because they did not understand the letter they received. Sally learned that the mortgage had not been paid in over 6 months and they had sent multiple letters to the home that Ann lived in. By the time Sally was involved, she only has a few days left to pay the debt. I live in a different state over 1000 miles away and Sally called me because the mortgage company had offices in my state, but not theirs. I was on standby in case her latest payment did not go through, so that I could pay the debt myself in person. Eventually her wire transfer was accepted and the crisis was averted. When my parents and Sally finally confronted Ann, she claimed that the bank had lost the payments but refused to show any sort of statements to back up her claims. Some harsh words were said, but my parents decided to let it go in the name of peace. Ann ended up moving out but blames Sally for getting involved when it wasn’t “her business”. \n\nMonths pass and I decided to use the holiday travel for baby showers as this was my 1st pregnancy. Sally offered to throw me the baby shower at her home. Ann never showed up and gave different excuses to different people. A few weeks later, I get a voice note from Ann crying saying she couldn’t come to my party because she couldn’t imagine being in Sally’s home after “what she did to her” and to reach out to her “when I was ready”. Heavily pregnant and hormonal, I was upset she would try to blame someone else and that she was putting the responsibility of our relationship on me while dealing with a difficult pregnancy. So I didn’t respond for over 6 months. In that time Ann has sent random posts from social media as if everything is fine. I finally got fed up today and responded to a message saying she could take accountability for taking advantage of her family, or no longer have a relationship with me. Am I the asshole for bringing up the conflict with my parents or should I stay out of it? ",

      "scenario_description": "My aunt has recently approached me regarding a share of an apartment I inherited from my late mother 16 years ago. My aunt apparently discussed buying my mum out of her share of the apartment 16 years ago and according to my aunt, they performed a valuation of the apartment and had agreed on a sale. Approximately a year or so after this discussion took place, my mother died. Neither her will, nor the executor of her estate, contains any mention of the apartment. Nor is there any written contract or anything else written down regarding the details of the deal. \n\nMy aunt approached me shortly after the death of my mother, stating only the records she would require from me for the transfer of my inherited share, but mentioned that she currently didn't have the funds to buy me out.\n\nIn the intervening years, my aunt has brought up the apartment a few times, telling me that we finally need to sort it out, and that she owed me money. No specifics were ever mentioned and the last written email I have is now over a decade old.\n\nMy aunt now wishes to finally have the share transferred, however wants to buy me out of my inherited share according to the valuation of 16 years ago. The current market value of the apartment has however gone up by about a factor of four in the intervening years.\n\nI would like to sell my share of the apartment, however find it unfair that my aunt wants to pay me what the share was 16 years ago rather than its current value. \n\nMy aunt states that she had a deal with my mother all those years ago and that I should honour that deal.\n\nWIBTA if I stood my ground and demand to be paid according to the current market value? A contributing factor to consider is that my aunt now has big health problems and is facing retirement with very little in terms of retirement benefits.",

      "scenario_description": "So my (f31) ex husband (m33) just broke up in March of this year. I won’t go into details about it but he sprung it on me quite suddenly. We just bought a house together a little over a year ago and we’ve both been living there in the meantime while I look for a new place to live and our lawyers figure out the financial details. I’m not particularly attached to the house so I don’t mind moving but it takes time. \n\nI currently have one 14 year old chihuahua mix who was my dog before I met my ex husband so I will be keeping the dog with me.  Ex loves dogs and spoke a lot about wanting to get another dog. He even showed me specific other dogs he had been considering just a few weeks before he dumped me. He now tells me the one of the reasons he wanted another dog so bad was that he could have a dog that was just his. \n\nHe recently sent me a message asking if it would be okay for him to get another dog soon, while I’m still in the house. I told him no because he works quite a bit and I don’t have a day job (I’m an artist) so I’d be the one at home all day taking care of this new dog. I also said it was unfair to my dog to make him socialize with a new dog all of a sudden, especially since we won’t be staying here. My dog is old and not super friendly to other dogs. \n\nI do feel a little bad that ex still helps with my dog but him and my dog have lived together for like 8 years so of course my dog still loves him and asks for attention from him. The dog doesn’t know what’s going on. It’s also not like he needs very much care. Ex just gives him food in the morning and lets him outside a few times and lets him snuggle with him. \n\nEx said that he didn’t expect this whole divorce/me moving out process to take so long and tried to make me feel guilty by saying a lot of the dogs he looks at are at shelters where they’ll be put down soon if they’re not adopted. \n\nAm I the asshole for just telling him to wait and not look at new dogs until I’m gone?",

When I returned home, my dad (45M) greeted me as usual and he asked to borrow my phone (He uses it to watch stuffs to pass the time). The next day when I was about to cash the money out, I noticed that my balanced was zero and I immediately panicked, when I saw the history, it showed an online c*sin* website and the money is transfered to it. I confronted my dad about it and he denied it, he only told me when he noticed my eyes the next day all swelled up from crying and I completely broke down and asked him why would he do that. I've been working extra to give the money back and I am currently not talking to my dad. I just want that check up man.",

      "scenario_description": "I am an introvert with a highly social customer-service job, and I often need to take my lunch hour alone to recharge.\n\nNext door to my workplace is a big, well-kept cemetery. There are shade trees, small gravel paths, and benches here and there. On nice days, I take my lunch to one of those benches, eat my sandwich and read a book. Sometimes I walk along the paths and read the gravestones.\n\nLast week, I had just finished my lunch and was packing things away when another visitor approached me and we began chatting. They said they were here to visit their parents, and asked whom I had lost. I had to admit that none of my loved ones were buried here, but that I was coming here because it was peaceful and I needed a place to take a break from my work.\n\nThey reacted to this with indignation; they said that I was being disrespectful. I was treating the cemetery like a personal park and I didn't care about people's grief.\n\nI apologized and left immediately, and haven't been back since. But I was surprised to hear this, as I had not thought I was being disrespectful. I don't think I would mind if my loved one were buried in a cemetery where people sometimes ate their lunches and read their books. I don't think I would mind if I knew people would do that in the cemetery where I was buried. I don't leave litter, I don't intrude on other people--I am literally there to be alone and in peace--and if there were a graveside service being held, I would stay quite far away so as not to bother the mourners.\n\nBut... just coming to a cemetery to sit and be quiet, without mourning? Eating lunch? Reading gravestones of people I'd never known? Was I being disrespectful?",

      "comment_text": "That sounds odd to me. Maybe things are different in different places ... but I've visited any number of cemeteries in different towns and cities, and while some visits were of course in connection to people buried there, many were out of interest (especially in historic cemeteries), convenience, or, as in your case, to find a quiet urban space to walk through or sit in, maybe even eating a sandwich. There are two fairly old cemeteries not far from where I live (in a city) and although both are technically full, there are sometimes new burials there. It's possible to be buried with a relative, and one of them in particular has set up a small columbarium so you can have your ashes deposited there even if you don't have a deceased relative whose grave they can be buried in. So, not all the graves date back to the 1800s or 1900s. Some are for recent deaths and may be visited by mourners. In both cemeteries, it's really convenient when you're on foot to cross the cemetery diagonally as a short cut from one road to another instead of walking around it. I've never heard of anyone objecting to this practice. The bigger and older of the two has some benches where you can sit quietly under the trees. \n\nDisrespectful behaviour in cemeteries involves running around (particularly across graves), making a racket,  damaging the markers, or moving or taking flowers. Some cemeteries, depending on their age, also don't like memorial objects placed on a grave because it complicates maintenance. (Old cemeteries are usually not designed to be maintained by people using sit-on mowers in the first place, so this isn't such a big issue.) Sitting quietly on a bench, possibly having lunch or reading, is not disrespectful. Grieving people often need to be given a bit of grace, though, since they are so upset, and I'd personally attribute such a reaction to the effects of grief.\n\nNTA",

      "scenario_description": "I (14F) have an older brother, J(16M), who despises the fact that I cosplay, and only seems to tolerate it when I can do something for him with the skills I gained cosplaying. I recently got into competitive cosplay, and I’m currently working on a really complicated build for a competition next month. I was at a thrift store with my family, looking for curtains or bedsheets to make the large white part of the costume, when I find the most BEAUTIFUL pure white bedsheet for only $2, when J grabs it and says “You can use this to make my JESUS COSTUME!” I, being confused, told J that this wasn’t for his Jesus costume, and I was never informed that I had to make a Jesus costume.\n\nHe said that he assumed I would make it for him, but because it’s summer, I asked what it was for because he hates cosplay, conventions, and everything similar to that. Apparently, it was for a wrong occasions party in one week. J told me that I could use most of the sheet for his costume, and use the rest for my cosplay. I told J that making the Jesus costume would take a long time, and that just the scraps aren’t enough for what I’m trying to make. He called me a ”manipulative b\\*tch,” and said that his friend’s mom could do it in an hour. I then told him to find his own bed sheet and have his friend’s mom make it if she could do it so much better than me. J called me a couple of slurs and left. It’s been a few days and he’s still mad, and I kinda feel bad because my competition is in a month, and his party is in a few days. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT 1: realized I should add an explanation as to why a Jesus costume would take me so long. I don’t have a sewing machine, and I don’t understand patterns, so I self-pattern AND hand sew everything. And I mean everything, even the shorts I wear under skirts. I am also a huge procrastinator and have unmedicated ADHD. I’m kept on track by Will Wood‘s full discography and a six pack of cherry coke during all nighters.\n\nEDIT 2: WOW yall thank you SO MUCH for 350 upvotes! :3 yall are super cool and amazing. As for the concern surrounding the fact that I don’t have a sewing machine, my birthday is in a month, and I asked for a beginner friendly Brother sewing machine. I’m also $25 dollars away from affording my own! I’ve been saving up for one. :D Thanks once again for all the support.",

      "scenario_description": "This past weekend my family got together for fathers day and 4 of my cousins birthday. We do this fairly often for holidays and I've never had any issues with my family until just this past weekend. \n\nSome context I, 19, am the assistant manager for 7/11. I love my job but id be lying if I said it wasnt absolutely exhausting as I have multiple physical disabilities. \n\nMy uncle, 50ish, works for Pepsi and has been a driver for quite a few years now. \n\nAt a previous family gathering I was complaining about how our Pepsi delivery person has dumped their product in front of our food area making it nearly impossible for people to get stuff. To add to that, the driver that day was also the merchandiser so they were supposed to put it away for us, meaning I had to move everything myself. I was pretty frustrating about this and complained at the past gathering as I had just come from work. \n\nThe issue arises this previous weekend though. I was having a pretty good time with my family and while having dessert I decide to make a joke with my uncle, one I had started making mostly to my parents and manager. I say to my uncle \"hey uncle did you used to eat glue as a child?, \"\nHe responded with \"I didn't eat glue but I sniffed it.\" Thats when I say \"well I feel like to work for Pepsi it's a requirement to eat some glue\"\nThis is when he goes ballistic on me. I don't remember exactly everything he said because I was completely frozen with anxiety but the gist of what he said was \"this is now the second time you (me) has made fun of my company and my workers, put yourself in their shoes, they have 15 deliveries in a day and are killing themselves and their bodies to try and get all of them done. They are KILLING THEMSELVES and all you've done is complain about their job when they don't have it easy. \" \n\nDon't get me wrong I never said they had an easy job but at the same time it's also not easy doing my job and when they do a half-assed job it means I have to go through all the stock and try and figure out what they did and didn't do. Plus half the time they just throw stuff wherever they feel with no regards\n\nTo be honest I don't really know if the drivers get a time limit per store or something but I know my store is small and when we did get 2 deliveries a week the Saturday one (the main one I was in charge of) was all stuff that could've been done in a half hour at most. \n\nAfter the explosion my uncle came in a gave me an \"apology\" basically saying if I had so many problems with the Pepsi drivers complain to corporate (which I don't have the power to do) and not to him because he cant do anything about it. \n\nI never expected him to fix my issues with our few crappy drivers, I was just trying to make a small jab at him and he's always been s fairly chill dude so I didn't expect it to turn out this way. \n\nSo am I the asshole for making a joke about the company my uncle works for?

When the teacher got to me, I waved, and she crashed out for no reason when she saw me reading. She was calling me disrespectful and rude because I was reading instead of answering the register (which I did anyway). She straight up told me to put the book away, which I didn't do. She bluffed to give me a detention which was kinda scary to me because I had never had one before (I wasn't a goodie two shoes I just wasn't an asshole). I continued reading it out of spite and eventually she gave up on the threat and I did the work just fine afterwards. I was thinking about the moment last night in the shower and it made me think: most of our life in school teachers tell us to \"read books whenever possible\" but even if I want to, in a time where nobody would get harmed by my actions- during the register- where me reading has no reason to annoy a teacher so much- she gets annoyed and tells me off for basically doing what school has told us to do all my life. Wanted to share the story and see what other people think. ",

I could read if I'd finished a math (or whatever) in class assignment and needed to wait for the entire class to finish. \n\nYou're also being disingenuous by claiming that you were just doing what \"school has told us to do all my life\". I'm willing to bet they didn't tell you to read while some class activity was going on, much less after the teacher told you to stop, causing a dispute between you and the teacher that wasted the time of the rest of the class, even if all they were doing was completing the register/roll call.",

My parents divorced when I was very young and ended up spending most time with my mother. \n   My father had every other weekend with me and my older sister. As you could imagine we never understood what was happening until we were older. \n   My mother would tell us that he was abusive and an alcoholic. I never saw abuse but remember a lot of verbal fights and door slams. My father would say that my mother would lie and manipulate us to turn us against him. For many reasons I see his side my mother didn’t let us contact him besides when we visited on the weekends and always talked bad about him. Every time we got back from his house it was never “how was you dads sweetie” it was “are you ok? It wasn’t too bad was it?” \n   Eventually my mother won full custody of us and about 5 or 6 years ago we stoped visiting him. My mother made it impossible for him to see us. \n   I don’t blame my mother for pushing him out of our lives and I don’t hate my father for being a bad person. Me and my sister have grown up since I think he should know how we are doing. My mother would feel extremely betrayed if she found out and definitely look at me differently.So I guess the question is WIBTA if reached out or visted him?\n\nShort \nParents divorced at young age Dad was alcoholic Mom was manipulative Mom got full custody WIBTA if I reached out to alcoholic dad",

I informed him politely that I had built that, and that there are multiple bins of color coded Lego in the next room over. He then proceeded to continue around 5 minutes later, I once again told him to stop, he once again didn’t listen, this happened another 2 or three times until he dropped one of my creations (A 2000 piece custom build of a Porsche that took me two days to finish) And I exploded, I shouted that I had reminded him multiple times that what I had built wasn’t for him to take apart, and asked him how he would feel if I did the same. he replied with stating that the only thing he owns is a basketball, and then I was pulled aside and talked to. My mom stated that Legos weren’t losing a friend for, and I agreed, but the fact that this has happened multiple times in the past, and that I told him not to multiple times just pushes me in the wrong direction. I do want to keep him as a friend, but I’m tired of losing things to mistreatment or just straight up loss. Am I in the wrong here?\n\n",

My guardian Jennifer and my auntie Sarah asked me what days I can get off work. I told them that my dates were August 7–10, while everyone else’s dates were August 7–11.\n\nOne of my other family members, Nina, booked the flights for everyone. I didn’t know she was the one booking — I thought Jennifer or Sarah were booking the flights were taking care of it or would tell whoever was booking since they were the ones who asked me about my PTO. This has never been an issue before — usually if I tell them my dates for family trips, they handle it.\n\nWhen the tickets were sent out, I realized my flight was for 7–11 instead of 7–10. I told the Nina and she gave me her card to rebook the flight and asked me not to tell my other guardian Ashley about the $175, because she would be upset/angry about it (Ashley pays for the trips usually).\n\nToday, Nina told Jennifer about it. Jennifer then told me it was unfair for Nina to cover the cost and that I should’ve made sure to communicate my dates directly to Nina to avoid a mishap. But I honestly didn’t know who was booking and assumed Jennifer or Sarah were handling the bookings since they asked me the dates and it hasn't been an issue in the past.\n\nNow Jennifer wants me to pay the $175 myself, but I don’t have that money right now. If I’d known who was actually booking, I definitely would’ve double-checked. I know now in the future if my plans are different to double check, it's just never been a problem before so I had no reason to think it would be different this time. Also side note all of m.y family members mentioend are 50s\n\nSo, AITA for not double-checking? And what should I do?",

      "scenario_description": "My mother hasn’t spoken to me for 2.5 months (not a single word) despite us living in the same house because I told her she was selfish. She went out and bought something (which she took from me) without even thinking about asking me if I needed some. She claims I was rude to her because I said “you bought it because it was on sale but didn’t even cross your mind to ask me if I needed some, that’s real nice of you”\n\nDespite this, I’m trying to do something nice for her. Her car (which my sister and I bought for her about 4 years ago) currently is broken down, she needs to take it to the garage and because she doesn’t work (hasn’t done so in 15 years for no real reason) doesn’t have money to pay to get it fixed.\nMy dad (her ex husband) has a car he told me he’s planning to sell, I immediately thought of her. I told him not to sell it and I’d come get it. It’s a 2015 Nissan Qashqai, not the most fancy car but decent and far better than what she currently has. I’ve paid 1200£ to get a few things fixed with the car and planning to drive 2.5 hours each way to get it for her. My sister told her and her first response was to say she doesn’t need our help and then to say the car was not good enough for her. She started asking does it have leather seats because she wants material, she doesn’t want to take on a crap car, she would rather a Mercedes and doesn’t like the look of SUVs…then my sister said maybe she should consider talking to [me]because I’m doing something nice for her, and she flipped. She said she didn’t ask me to and she won’t give up her “self respect” by talking to me…\n\nI truly don’t feel like I own her an apology. And after all of this I feel like I need to move out and start distancing myself which I never thought I’d say \n\nShe does stuff like this a lot.\nTwo months ago she wanted a new TV and rather than getting a decent Tv for £500~ she said that wasn’t good enough for her and was set on getting a £1600 TV. I told her it was irresponsible to use that much money on a TV considering she has not a penny to her name, my autistic brother has not a penny to his name and there’s so much he needs and her mother is stuck in another country, poor. And she made it seem like I was terrible for not wanting her to have something good. I borrowed her the money to get the TV she wanted. She does not work and most appliances in the house are broken and when I/we have offered to help her new ones, (mid range) she always kicks up a fuss about and says they aren’t good and she’d rather keep her old broken one if she’s not getting the best branded appliances \n\nI will add my mum fell into depression after having my brother. Than his autism. But it’s been 16 years. I’ve tried hard over the last 3 years to get her help. She sleeps till about 1pm every day and makes the biggest deal when you ask her to do the tiniest thing. I even tried going with her to the GP to start therapy for depression. She never followed through. ",

      "scenario_description": "**The set-up (bare facts)**\n\n*Status quo* – We broke up a week ago, but the tenancy is still joint and we still split the rent.  \n*Players* – Two mid-twenty-somethings; I’ll call the ex “EX.”  \n*Why no instant escape?* – Milan rents laugh at solo wallets, and neither of us can shoulder the full lease alone.\n\n**The night in question**\n\nAt 05:00 on Saturday, EX rang my phone so I could buzz them in. They arrived with a friend who, I learned on the spot, would be sleeping on our sofa. She went straight to bed and isn’t part of the story again.\n\nEX reached the hallway, collapsed against the wall (coat and shoes still on) and launched into the sort of dramatic monologue you’d expect from a drunken ex at five in the morning. I removed their outer layers, guided them to bed and tucked them in. They shivered, sobbed and cycled through:\n\n1. “You were not enough for me!”\n2. “Why didn’t you fight for us?”\n3. “You never cared.”\n\nI offered water, kept my voice down and reminded them that we should be sleeping. After about an hour of uninterrupted drama they finally dozed off around 06:00.\n\n**My response**\n\nI couldn’t get back to sleep, so total rest that night was one hour. Running on fumes, I showered, grabbed a change of clothes, silenced my phone and spent the day at a friend’s place. I returned at 20:00, told EX what had happened (they remembered nothing) and said:\n\n– I don’t want another emotional ambush.  \n– I’m worried about their drinking and want it to stop.\n\n**Fallout**\n\nEX agreed at first, but after talking to friends the next day they accused me of “abandoning” them and not even sending a “How are you feeling?” text. They point out that their friend and previous ex always check in, whereas I “just escaped out of self-centredness.”\n\n**Why I might be the arsehole**\n\n• I didn’t send a basic welfare text.  \n• EX’s friend was on the sofa; I could have handed over duty of care before leaving.  \n• I left without saying a word.\n\n**Why I might not be**\n\n• EX chose 5 a.m. drunken confession hour, and we’re post-break-up.  \n• We are now flat-mates, nothing more.  \n• I genuinely needed space for the day (I didn’t ghost them; I just stepped away).\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for seizing my own peace and quiet after the 5 a.m. drama, or did I breach some unwritten post-relationship nursing code?",

My friend and I have known each other for about a year and we got instantly close when we met and we hang out a lot and really skipped past all the small talk and we talk about the deepest things with each other. She is a compassionate and very positive person, too. However, I am an expat and a lot of her friends are local so because of the language I don't hang out with them as a group, but she and I do separately, so I don't know her other friends that well. Her fiancé and my fiancé also know each other from work. My fiancé and I have our wedding this month and they have their wedding in a year. They are invited to our wedding and we to theirs. She spent a long time looking for a dress for my theme for my wedding and even showed me photos and went to a lot of trouble getting the dress and was so happy and made sure it fit my theme. She asks me how the planning is going all the time and shares their plan for that weekend to attend as well.\n\nYesterday her fiancé asked my fiancé for lunch. Turns out, her best friend has planned a bachelorette party for her the same weekend as our wedding (they are doing their civil wedding this year so this is why it's earlier) and it's a surprise so he was basically informing us that he will come but she will not be coming. Of course, she does not know, but since we hang out, her fiancé asked my fiancé not to tell me until I have no more hangouts with her before the wedding so as not to make it awkward! He asked my soon-to-be husband to lie to me, which I think is very strange and rude.\n\nMy fiancé was so mad at this and of course, told me straightaway. He asked her fiancé why he would say to her friends this weekend was available and it turns out \"this weekend was the best fit out of all options\" whatever that means. I think he messed up the planning for the weekends and is now using us to get out of the mess he made, but how will she feel when she is told all of this the night before, and how am I supposed to act with her when we hang out when I know this whole thing. I won't lie to her that I have no idea and talk about how excited we are for the wedding day.\n\nMy fiancé will call him this evening and uninvite both of them and tell him he has told me they are not coming, but not the reason, as he doesn't want us to get involved in these lies for her fiancé to get out of a situation. Since this is not a random plan, this is a wedding, he can't lie to me for weeks about this. When I see her and she mentions the wedding I will just say that I am sad that they both can't make it and then her fiancé can figure out a different lie to get out of this. Am I the asshole for uninvited them both in this situation?\n\n  \nClarification: I would not be uninviting both of them since she will already have her party so is not coming, just going to tell her fiancé he should not bother coming if its not both of them. That\\`s all. I see a lot of comments saying its wrong to uninvite her, I will not do that. But he is the plus one in a way, so kind of weird he is coming without her. Also, no I am not mad that I am not invited I understand why and zero issues with it. I am mad at him. ",

YWBTA if you did that.\n\nYou could instead tell her directly, ideally face-to-face, that her fiance has told you that she cannot come, and although of course you will understand (but be disappointed) if that is the case, you wanted to find out from her directly if that is true since her fiance made it sound like the whole question of whether they would attend or not needed to be kept a secret from you and from her.\n\nThen let things happen as they will. Maybe she actually will decline your invitation, maybe not. Who knows what's motivating her fiance to do something so odd? But doing it that way might salvage your friendship with her, which will probably not survive you uninviting both or them, or you going through this weird pretense, seeing her regularly socially as though she were still coming - and then stopping.",

      "scenario_description": "My (21M) dad died. It’s just me and my brothers (19M, 19M) and distant relatives. We have more family friends than we do close family so we try to value the family we do have when we get to see them. His funeral was yesterday.\n\nOur cousin Khalie (24F) lived with us for much of her life because her mom struggled (being a single mom and in and out of difficult situations). I wouldn’t say my dad solely raised her but he played a big part in it, so they were close but since she turned 21 or so she’s moved out of state and hasn’t really come around much. Fine.\n\nShe volunteered to make slideshows for the funeral. Great. One was going to be right before the eulogy and the other was going to be right after.\n\nUntil yesterday she didn’t mention having any scheduling conflicts, but then sprung on us that she was picking up her mom from the airport in the morning and might be late. Fine, whatever. She’d maybe miss most of the viewing.\n\nBut then she starts calling during the viewing saying they had to eat and would be 60-90 minutes late and asked if we could request pushing things back, mind you, everything was already in motion. I said maybe the order of events could be changed but there was too much going on and didn’t get a chance to talk to the funeral home so things proceeded as normal.\n\nI stopped answering her texts which she assumed meant things got moved around. She eventually arrived towards the end, missed most of everything, got pissy with me after, saying I was selfish and talking to the funeral home could have been quick and easy and now she and her mom(?) feel robbed.\n\nNow she’s ranting on social media about her asshole family (me) denying her from being able to see her tributes. Mind you, her tributes are on her damn computer or CapCut or whatever she used to make them.\n\nI stupidly texted her briefly and said I wish it could have worked out but she just reiterated I am a selfish asshole. Am I?",

Basically, if I tell her anything about my life, she’ll go and talk about it with the whole extended family. Like... everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins, even random relatives I barely know or haven’t seen in forever. Nothing’s too small—she’ll mention stuff about who I’m seeing, stuff with my job, health stuff, money stuff... just everything.\n\nI’ve told her to stop doing that so many times. Like I’ll say “hey, I don’t want anyone else knowing about this,” and she’ll nod like she gets it—but then later I hear she’s been talking. And when I call her out, she always says something like, “Oh, come on, it’s just family!” or “I wasn’t gossiping, I was just chatting.” Like??? That doesn’t really make it better.\n\nAnyway, not long ago I had this minor medical thing done—nothing serious, but definitely personal. I told her ahead of time, super clearly, that I didn’t want anyone else knowing. Just wanted to keep it to myself.\n\nThen like three days later, I start getting these “how are you feeling??” texts from a bunch of my aunts. And yep—turns out my mom told them. Again.\n\nI was honestly so frustrated. I called her and told her straight up that I felt like she didn’t respect my privacy, and that I was hurt she went and told people again after I asked her not to. I told her I need her to stop sharing my life like that—it’s not just casual chatting when it’s stuff I asked her to keep private.\n\nShe got really upset. Said I was attacking her, said I was overreacting and being cold, and now she won’t talk to me. My dad says I should’ve handled it “more gently” and that I made her feel bad. So now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far.\n\nWas I the asshole for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "Using an old throwaway for this cuz some of my coworkers know my main. I’m 20f and I’m ethnically Korean but grew up bouncing around different countries due to my parents job. My friend said that I’m “passively bilingual” in that I understand when my grandparents speak Korean to me, but I struggle to respond. Forget about reading or writing lol. My parents both grew up in the US and the grandparents I have left speak English so my bad Korean never caused any communication problems. \n\nMy parents gave me a “Korean name” and never gave me an “English name” (who knows why) even though a lot of ABCs usually go by an English name at school or work. This is fine by me, I like my name and yeah it sucked when some teachers got it wrong growing up, but that’s life. \n\nNow here’s the problem: I started a part time job and there’s another girl working there, Emma (fake name, maybe 25ishf?), is uncomfortable because of my name. Thing is, Emma is Muslim and takes her religion really seriously (she wears the hijab, prays at work) and apparently my name means something bad in her religion? She doesn’t call me by my name, it’s always “hey you” or something like that. \n\nShe recently complained to our manager, Jen (who really is just our equal with a nicer title) that my name is insulting to her religion. The two of them basically cornered me in the break room and asked if I can go by a nickname or an “English name.” I said no obviously but Emma and Jen think I’m not respectful of Emma’s religion and it’s not a big deal to use an English name since so many Asians do, and it’s not like I speak Korean or anything. \n\nI’m not sure if this is a hill worth dying on but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to go by another name???? AITA?\n\nEDIT: just got back to this post and I’m blown away by everyone’s support and wisdom🥹 Thank you all. I’m reading all of your comments and will think about what I will do next. I definitely do NOT wanna cave at this point. Some people have correctly guessed my name lol and im near tears over the sweet messages you’ve sent about it. Thank you again 🫶",

      "scenario_description": "I 23F moved out 6 months ago. I was In a toxic situation at home with parents who would fight constantly and were controlling. My dad was a narcissist and was being emotionally abusive and manipulative to my mom. I had been looking at apartments for a year, my parents knew I wanted to move out and had gone to a showing or two with me. They never came to any other showings because the first one went badly and they believed i was making the wrong choice. \n\nI continued looking for apartments. It was the most difficult and emotionally draining year of my life with the constant emotional instability at home. Things got really bad and I finally had enough. I found an apartment within my budget and close to work and told my mom about it, saying I was serious about it. She told me to hold off so we could “discuss things.” Every time we had “discussions” it was really them finding reasons to convince me not to move out, offer me a more “viable” solution or promise me things would get better at home soon. I decided to sign the lease, and told them after the fact that I had done so. This led to a week or so of constant arguments, them demanding that I cancel my lease and making me feel terrible. I tried explaining that things were so toxic that I had to remove myself but nothing I said seemed to matter. I was told I was being selfish, not thinking straight and was making a mistake I was going to regret. The day I moved out was awkward and despite not regretting my choice, I felt terrible for upsetting my family and betraying their trust by leaving them out of the decision. They didn’t help me with the moving process which I didn’t make them feel bad about. Once I finally was out, the distance felt like a relief and I went some time without contacting them as I wanted to breathe and gather my thoughts. \n\nFlash forward to now, 6 months later and my family is resentful towards me. My decision to move out (along with other behaviours such as prioritizing me and my happiness, focusing on my relationship with my boyfriend, and distancing myself) has caused a lot of resentment towards me. I’ve been told that they will never get over what I did, and that if I don’t get my act together and start making better decisions, I will end up alone. I’ve asked what I can do to help mend things (despite the fact that I’ve been the only one proactively reaching out and seeking some sort of connection for normalcy) but was basically told that I should know what I have to do. My apologies for betraying them seem to hold no value, justifying my actions just make me seem selfish and I don’t know what to do. While I accept the blame and part I played, I also feel like they’re holding a grudge over me. We’ve always been a very tight knit family with the expectation of full transparency so it’s been a shock to the entire family and a struggle for everyone involved. I’m at a loss and don’t know if I am really the asshole here?",

Words have meanings, and those actions simply aren't betrayal - you weren't dishonest; you just didn't tell them everything. You didn't violate any reasonable type of parent-child relationship...\n\nStop apologizing - it's not working, and they can't even tell you what they want/need you to do. Honestly, the \"YOU KNOW what you did wrong\" comment combined with an absolute refusal to say what was done wrong is something that really infuriated me when it was been directed at me, but I learned that it was usually an unreasonable thing for the other person to say.\n\nTry detaching - learning to accept that they don't approve of what you did, and also learning not to take that disapproval as fact when you know that what you did was reasonable. Don't justify your actions; as long as you have a reasonable reason to think they're justifiable, you can detach from your need for their approval of your actions.\n\nLimit contact; walk away/hang up/don't respond to attempts to dig up the old grudge. Practice a few short simple responses. \"We'll NEVER GET OVER WHAT YOU DID!!\" - \"I'm sorry to hear that, and I hope you do find a solution to it.\" \"You're going to DIE ALONE!\" - Shrug, \"Time will tell.\" Use responses that don't engage, don't apologize, don't offer to twist yourself inside out in an attempt to do something they won't accept and can't even define.\n\nOK, I'll stop the rant here - NTA, of course. Take time and distance to recover from the experience of moving out, and at the same time focus on all the pleasures of being able to plan your own independent life.",

They all said how exited they were for us and how they couldn't wait to be there when we said our vows... But planning a ceremony for all the people who've shown genuine interest in being there feels too exhausting and like some kind of flashy show off event for them... Plus typical weddings are EXPENSIVE. \n\nSo, my fiance and I are planning to have an intimate ceremony at the place of our first date with one of our friends officiate, one of my siblings as my witness, and another one of our best friends as his witness.\n\nBut I can't help but feel like our family and the rest of our friends will feel hurt we eloped without letting them be there. But the planning of accomodating that many people just feels too stressful. \n\nAlso, We plan to renew our vows down the road and tell everyone else that's our \"wedding day\" even though we already had been married for years.\n\nAm I wrong to feel selfish and the a$$h0/3 for wanting something really small and intimate, when I know a lot of people that support and love us want to be there ? \n\nAITA for telling them about it and not wanting them there when we say our vows?

      "comment_text": "Well, NTA for eloping (in my family, eloping is practically the norm) - but it would be ah behaviour to keep the wedding a secret and to later hold a fake wedding for the rest of the family. There's nothing like keeping a big secret  to ensure that most of the family will be deeply offended by their exclusion. This is particularly true when the secret is about an event that is usually intended to promote family unity and to be a celebration about a family member's milestone. Secrets do get out, so there's a high chance the family will find out if the \"wedding\" you invite them to is a fake, and you were really married years earlier.\n\nThe best way to do an elopement is to do it quickly, and notify everyone you didn't invite immediately afterwards. Don't say \"We didn't want you there\"; say some other version of the truth like \"We really wanted a very small wedding\". \n\nSure, at the stage in a relationship an elopement takes place the family knows a marriage might be in the cards, even if there isn't an official engagement. With an engagement, it might be possible to mention once or twice (just before the elopement, so as not to trigger lengthy discussions on the subject) that you're considering an extremely small wedding. Then elope, immediately send an notification to everyone (starting with your closest family before going public) and you've got what you wanted with a minimum of fuss. There will probably be some fuss - two of my relatives including in the notice that they were off on a short honeymoon. Some of the initial fuss and talk had died down by the time they got back - probably not all of it, since they could only manage to get away for a week.",

      "scenario_description": "I (26F) and my gf (28f) have been together 6 years. We've never managed to go on a long holiday together abroad so we're really keen to do it this year. \n\nOriginally we were going to go in August, but before we could book anything her family proposed a trip to the same country they all used to go when they were children. Girlfriend invited me along and I said yes as I assumed (stupidly) that it would also be in August. \n\nThe trip is planned for September. They didn't ask me when I would be free to go abroad until they'd already booked it, and September is problematic for me as work is really busy and I'm unlikely to get time off. Work is really great other times of the year - I can get time off during the summer at any time no questions asked- but September is our busy period and we're a small team. They're really great at other times of the year, and the job pays above my industry standard, so I don't mind that September is pretty much blocked off holiday wise.\n\nMy girlfriend's family can't move the holiday as they can't take time off during August as they're self employed and June/July/August are some of their best months for income. \n\nI also had already paid for tickets to a renaissance fair near me, happening on the weekend during the same period as the proposed holiday. My friends are all going and we were planning outfits and I was so excited for it. I've never been to one before and this is the first one in my area. Weekend tickets cost me over £100, and I'd lose this money if I didn't go as I wouldn't get a refund. I'm gutted that I might have to miss it. It's annoying that the trip was booked knowing that I had that planned but I understand that they had to go with when the majority of the family are free.\n\nThis is a lesser reason but I hate heat, and the country we're going to would be really hot. I'd likely be spending a lot of money to be indoors in air con all the time. Her stepdad has declined the holiday as he also hates the heat lol (and can't get the time off work).\n\nWIBTA if I didn't go? My girlfriend would be depressed if I didn't go and I feel really guilty even thinking about it. We can't go on both holidays as it would just be too expensive. It's her childhood happy place and she really wants to take me so I can experience it too. I can't help but feel like a shitty girlfriend. ",

There are many. many situations in which everyone, including her, are upset, disappointed, sad, even maybe depressed when things can't go their way. We deal with them.\n\nYou can't get time off in September, and you have a weekend already booked in September. Skip all the other reasons you have, and maybe even stick to the first. Don't say a word about the family choosing dates when you're busy - they may not have known that, and even if they did, as you point out yourself, they're going to prioritize family schedules. \n\nApologize to your girlfriend, say how disappointed you are that you won't be able to go there this year, and maybe suggest going with her in a year or two on dates you can make. Explain (as soon as possible so they can cancel your reservations, if they made them) to her family in much the same manner, maybe leaving out that you and your girlfriend might plan a trip to the same destination without them in the future. Keep the focus firmly on how disappointing it is that you won't be able to get time off work.",

It’s nothing fancy, but it runs well and I take really good care of it—regular maintenance, I keep it clean, no smoking, no trash left inside, etc. I’ve always been a little protective of it because I rely on it every day for work.\n\nA few months ago, my friend (29F) let’s call her Sarah, asked to borrow it for a weekend trip because her car was in the shop. I hesitated but said yes because we’ve been friends for years and I wanted to help.\n\nShe returned it two days later with:\nLess than a quarter tank of gas (I’d filled it before giving it to her),\nFast food wrappers in the back seat,\nDirt all over the passenger floor,\nAnd the cherry on top: a mystery scratch on the back bumper she swore “was already there” (it wasn’t)\nI didn’t say much at the time because I hate confrontation, but I was honestly pissed. Especially because I expected more out of someone who I am friends with .\n\nFlash forward to this week,she texts me asking if she can borrow my car again for a different trip. I told her no, very politely , and said I just wasn’t comfortable loaning it out anymore. She seemed to have gotten upset with me and was saying things like “are you sure you can’t just help me out, I feel like that’s what friends do for each other” like I feel like she’s guilt tripping me idk.\n\nI responded initially but now I’m waiting to reply to her. But now I’m getting messages from another mutual friend saying I’m being too uptight and that it wouldn’t kill me to help her out “just this once.” I feel like I’m being guilt-tripped for setting a boundary after already being taken advantage of once.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to let her borrow my car again?",

I moved into two weeks ago and I'm trying not to rock the boat too much but I'm having issues with the shared fridge. The person who's shelf is above mine has moved his down to give himself double the shelf space but it leaves me with very little room to work with (for context I can't fit an onion on my shelf) and it's leaving me with a limited set of foods that I can buy and store there. I've tried to bring it up but freeze up every time (I know I need to just get over it and talk to my house mate, but that's easier said than done). This housemate isn't the most approachable and spends a lot of time in his room playing video games quite loudly and without his headphones. I let slip to my mum and she wants to get a mini fridge that I could set up somewhere in the kitchen. But I'm worried that this may come off as kind of passive aggressive and rude. I'm just really trying not to make waves... I've only lived there for two weeks and I know the last female that lived there was asked to leave by the landlord because \"she wasn't a good fit\", whatever that means. So would I be the asshole for getting one?",

      "scenario_description": "\nAbout two weeks ago, my(23) boyfriend’s(24) cousins family endured a house fire, losing everything. R(22), D(21), and J(4mo.)\n\nThey went on to stay at his mom’s(65) house for 2 nights, but got kicked out of there because they flipped out on her for the way she was caring for their baby… it was so bad they had to be removed by other family members.\n\nThey asked us if they could stay very suddenly and put us on the spot.. we felt like we had to say yes.\n\nWe didn’t lay any ground rules down as it was sudden and just recently they had people stay with them so we figured they knew to at least respect our home.\n\nThey came, started moving our things around, even after we told them not to, they continued. They’d leave their messes in the sink, their bedroom was DISGUSTING with diapers on the floor and clothes laying around. When I would be in the living room with them, they’d talk over my movie/show, or completely ignored me when I spoke. They would go downstairs and yell at the neighbor not to touch their packages even though she was only putting them on our side of the porch lol. The baby would be left crying for over 10-15mins at time while they were outside smoking (we weren’t allowed to touch the baby at all). They had 2 cats and they didn’t clean the litter boxes, and their cat ate my $40 charger. \n\nI asked my boyfriend to address these issues with them because I knew they wouldn’t respect my wishes, and he did yesterday. He sent a text message (I wrote because he’s dyslexic) after we went to work asking them them to replace the charger and to please clean up after themselves more. D flipped out on specifically me so bad, she called me a “weird ass” and told my boyfriend they only appreciated him and that I was the issue. That caused me to tell them that they have 3 days to leave my home. She continued to flip her shit even more, to which I told them they had to be out that night.\n\nMy boyfriend told them to take essentials and come back at 12pm the next day. I gave them 3.5 hours and then at 10:30pm, i told them to take their last load and leave. They took their last load, and I locked the door behind them. This caused D to pound on the door like a psychopath, and woke our downstairs neighbor up. I had to call the cops to get them to leave.\n\nMy boyfriend told me that I caused a wedge in our relationship by doing that. Which, i feel is unfair. They were specifically targeting me & I don’t want to feel like I can’t be in my own home. He said it was morally wrong and that I should’ve waited til they got their apartment in July.\n\nI’m aware I might be the asshole to immediately kick them out, and it could’ve been handled better but that’s just not what happened.\n\nSo, AITA for kicking them out?",

I was pretty upset but I kinda let it slide the entire day because I thought she would give them back but before I knew it, it was already 6pm. I then tried to forcibly take them back on a bus ride which caused her to start squirming around and when I asked why she didn’t wanna give it back she just said “no reason.” She also acted very seriously as if I was the perpetrator instead. I tried to steal her glasses instead and while she was tussling around tryna avoid me in her seat, it broke. She proceeded to try and break mine which I stopped by grabbing onto them very tightly. My uncle finally intervened after all this and said we were both at fault. He took away my glasses and now my cousin is sulking because hers are broken. She also began crying and atp I was kinda starting to too. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "TLDR: we are 3 students planning on subleasing a friend's apt from 6.16. 2 ppl asked to live longer. They have parking and we need the parking. We say no. We have issues about rent and the living situation. Their texts are really rude. They highkey gaslight us. We try to get to a compromise in a call. Call was unproductive. 1 friend drops out. I drop out. Last friend does not want to drop until the friend who is subleasing to us is super mean. The friend's apt send a paragraph stating they don't want to sublease to us. Once again, we just want to know if we are in the wrong and were rude to our mutual friend bc they are a good person who I respected until now.\n\nLonger Version:\n\nWe were planning on subleasing over our university summer. This is the same apt we would be living together at during the '25 - '26 academic year. The ppl we are subleasing from are K, G, L. We expressed clear interest that we also wanted to summer sublease. We have started the convo about subleasing since day 1, but confirmed plans to do so as we all got our move-in dates: 6.16 and until their lease ends.\n\nWe all have to move in 6.16 as we live in university-apts. We were going to pay their full rent over the sublease with no discounts (1025 each with an extra 100 for parking). The only thing they would have done is pay for the spot they could not find a subleaser for.\n\nWe have texts confirming that 6.16 works. But, they sent a message saying how they needed extra days to move out / celebrate graduation. 2 asked; they have parking spots. Our cars would have to street park.They asked for 1 week.\n\nThen, they said 2 days. In this 2 days, they wanted all 3 of us to stay in 1 room with 1 person sleeping on an air mattress. This is a no as A1 and A2 value their space + we all have new jobs that Monday/Tuesday. If they do this, we would back out.\n\nK called A1 and backtracked and said it would just be their stuff. Half of 1 room would have stuff and be used for storage. A2 is living in that room, she said she would not want this.\n\nA2 finds an apt for all 3 of us this same night in the same building for 790$ a month each Subleaser would most likely also pay the missing 4th person's rent.\n\nK sends a message to A1 directly stating her anger and how hurt she feels if A1 backs out.  A1 replies and states how she didn't like the guilt tripping and that the price is very desirable. 10:30pm, K defends her original message to A1, how the deposit is not a retribution and how she has been stressed out being the mediator and how they were wiling to negotiate. Ends with how K is looking into other options unless she hears back from A1.\n\nG and L and K send a \\]text stating how they think we were rude to their 2-day request. We were mean to K and she needs a apology. We were antagonist and they need empathy bc this is their home. They are paying 1/4 of the apt, so they have the right to be there / leave their stuff there. They do not want to sublease to\\*\\*\\* us.",

They are left in the lurch, but they were putting you to massive inconvenience with their last minute change, and they did it first. \n\nI have no idea if any of you were mean to K and should apologize because I don't know enough about what was said and how it was said. \n\nNTA",

Lately, my girlfriend keeps referring to our kid as “my little bestie” constantly — in person, on social media, everywhere. Like:\n– “Out for lunch with my little bestie 🩷”\n– “My bestie and I are watching Netflix 😍”\n– “Bestie vibes only 👯‍♀️”\n\nI asked her (nicely, I thought) if she could maybe tone it down. I said it feels kind of weird to call your infant “your bestie” and that maybe it’s good to let kids just be kids, not mini BFFs. I also admitted it kind of makes me cringe.\n\nShe got defensive and said I was being cold and controlling. She thinks it’s sweet and harmless, and says she wants our daughter to feel close to her emotionally as she grows up.\n\nI’m now wondering if I’m being overly critical. I’m all for her bonding with our daughter — I just personally feel like constantly calling her a “bestie” turns parenting into performative friendship.\n\nAITA?\n",

For example, calling a child \"Lovie\" or \"Love\" or \"My little love\" or even \"Sweetheart\" or \"Sweetie\" doesn't imply a romantic relationship.\n\nWhether using such terms will affect how the child feels when they grow up, I don't know because the use of such terms usually declines as the child matures.\n\nI think you are over-reacting to a loving nickname.

      "scenario_description": "I’m a 22M, and I recently bought a house where my family is moving into. We’ve never owned a house before. Always rented. Fortunately, I worked hard from my late teens, and was able to buy this house for my family of 4 excluding me. \n\nMy girlfriend and I started dating 10 months ago. \n\nShe’s not happy that I bought my parents a house even though she and I don’t have a place to live. \n\nWe live in different countries at the moment, so I anyway can’t buy us a house even if I were in a position to.\n\nShe constantly mentions what about us? She doesn’t have a home since she doesn’t live with her parents, and constantly flies to my country or some other country for me with me.  So she’s practically living out of a suitcase right now. \n\n\nI tell her I’m just 22, and I just bought a house. I’m not in a position to buy another, and it’ll be stupid to even do so. \n\n\nWhen we live together, I pay for everything like rent, food, eating out, buy her a lot of gifts, and even pay for her flights most of the times. \n\nShe’s 30, and I tell her I’m not the reason you don’t have a home. We’ll have a home, just wait. She keeps saying, “till when?”\n\nNow, given how upset she gets when I mention the house for my parents, I hid from her that I’ve been helping my parents with the renovation with the house since it’s not a position to be lived in unless you fix it. Now this house needed about $8k-10k of renovations, and I told my girlfriend in Feb 2025 that I’m not helping my parents with this. \n\n But my parents didn’t have the money for it, so I’m helping them with the bills. \n\nAfraid of her reaction, which is why I haven’t told her yet.\n\nNow, I feel this isn’t something I should be afraid of. I’m just helping my parents. Not doing drugs or whatever. \n\nAm I the asshole for helping my parents build this house for them without telling my girlfriend?",

Financial dishonesty causes many a relationship breakdown. \n\nYou might consider whether it's worth staying with someone who not only has very different financial priorities than you do, but also has reactions to news she dislikes that frighten you and is pressuring you - who is much younger than she is - to provide for her (including a house) at a very high level. There might be many reasons, some of them valid, for someone who is 30 to be poor; but demanding a house on top of having you pay for most of her expenses, including travel, is no way to deal with that situation.

That seems like a very normal reaction, as does their reaction when you finally are picked up at about midnight. \n\nTheir idea, when they say they want you to go out, probably doesn't involve you disappearing for 12 hours. \n\nI am only saying ESH because you say that they didn't try to call you directly, but instead called around to people who might know where you are. If they had called you directly as well, they would clearly NOT be ah. In any case, at 16, you should not be assuming that \"you want me to go out more\" means \"you want me to vanish for 12 hours\". \n\nActually, when you're living with another person at any age, it's basic courtesy to let the people you live with about your schedule, especially when it affects them. \"I'm going out with my friends; I won't be back for supper/won't be back until late so don't wait up for me etc.\" That prevents them from cooking a meal that won't be eaten, being woken up from a sound sleep because you  hadn't taken your key having planned to come home earlier but not quite managed it, and gives them some guidance as to whether they should check the hospitals and ask the police if any bodies had been pulled out of the local river last night.",

      "scenario_description": "I’m gonna keep this short because I just really need an opinion on this I (F22) have recently moved into my first apartment after ages of trying to find a job after college. It’s been a pain but I’ve managed to get away from my mom and dad. I’ve been here for about a month and 2 days ago my parents came around the house for dinner. Now small side note, my partner passed away last year and I’ve really been struggling without him. The last thing that he gave me for my birthday was a very small houseplant (one of the ones that pretty much survive forever if you take care of it) so anyways after dinner I clean up and I notice it’s gone, of course I go into absolute PANIC mode because it’s the last shard of my passed partner. I look all around the house for a good 30 minutes and cannot find the thing. So of course I get suspicious, it’s hardly difficult to lose a god damn house plant. I call up my parents and my mom seems REALLY suspicious when I ask her about it, and after further questioning she eventually gives up, she stuffed it into her handbag with her and took it. Of course I was pissed and demanded it back and my mom kept on saying “it’s not a big deal honey” “it’s just a plant” so and so despite my saying it’s the last shard of my partner that i physically have left, I haven’t spoken to her since and I’ve really been considering going over there and giving her a piece of my mind. But at the end of the day it is a plant and she does collect them, plus, it’s my mom. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "UPDATE: this, though quick, has been the catalyst to the self-reflection I needed.\n\nI’ll drop my expectations. I don’t blame his mom for anything. She’s right. She may not be tactful, but she’s not wrong. Also, I wouldn’t want someone fighting with my kid either, so her reaction in my eyes is justified.\n\nHe doesn’t need to go on any of our family outings if he doesn’t want to, including big trips of course. If he wants to, awesome. He can take the car if he wants it, and if I’m still at my employer when he rolls around to college soon, my husband and I will foot the tax bill. \n\nJust because I’m upset right now and feeling a bit under appreciated, like we all do sometimes, doesn’t mean I have to change who I am, which is someone who wants that kid to succeed with any and all resources I can provide. Time spent with me or not. I know he loves and appreciates everything we all do for him, whether he verbalizes it. He’s a good kid and I can’t forget that. We’re a family who generally doesn’t fight much, so I guess I was just upset/sad. \n\nI (38f) have a stepson (16m) who I’ve been married to his father for 10 years. We’ve always had him 60% of the week. His mom has two other kids to two other fathers who aren’t in the picture plus the past couple years she’s always had a boyfriend living there with a couple kids of his own (it’s been a couple different boyfriends). I’m a big traveler and feel it’s important for kids growing up to travel as well. I’m not rich by any means but I save well and with my husbands help, we can afford it. \n\nRecently, I’ve started feeling under appreciated with everything. I work over full time (10-12 hour days usually) for an elite college and am about to start my phd program. I’ve also started to plan a trip to Europe for us (also have a 3f daughter). Stepson says he doesn’t want to go. I’ve had to force him on the last handful of trips with not even a thank you at the end; even when bringing one of his friends with him. \n\nHis mom started texting me saying he doesn’t have to go and I’m not his mom. She’s completely right. He doesn’t have to go and I’m not his mom. The thing is, they all expect me to pay for his college tuition with my employee benefits (I can get him a BS or BA for free- though of course I’ll get taxed). He has no college fund. I just recently passed up a better paying job in walking distance of my house with his college tuition in mind but now I feel like a dummy for that. Also, my parents were going to give him a car as well (they’re pretty well off). I’ve had enough of feeling like a doormat. My husband is just sitting on the fence hoping this all blows over. \nWIBTA if I decide to not let him take advantage of the free college or free car because like they say, he’s not my son? ",

I'm surprised you forced him to go on the last few trips, given that he didn't want to go and has a mother he can live with while you're away. \n\nIt's a bit disturbing that you're tying his reluctance to go on your family trips to your reluctance to allow him to use your job benefits (which would cost you only the taxes; surely less than all those trips). It's coming across as tit-for-tat, which is not a good way for an adult to engage in with a dependent teenager. It's not even teaching responsibility; declining an invitation on a trip has nothing to do with being offered a cheaper educational benefits, which, on their own, can be accepted or declined by the boy.\n\nThe car is another issue. Your parents should decide on their own whether they want to give him a car.\n\nIt sounds like you're really upset by the fact that your relationship with your step-son is not what you thought or hoped it might be, and prefer to go nuclear and end the relationship entirely rather than accept that at his age, he might not enjoy family vacations, and as a maturing teenager, should be able to make more and more of his own choices, especially ones that actually cost you less money (and remove a sulky teenager from the trip). \n\nYTA",
