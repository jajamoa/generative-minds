      "scenario_description": "I (27m) live with my wife and parents in my childhood home after losing our previous living space a few years ago. My parents spend 75% of the time living on their boat while we stay in the house. In the winter, they're off traveling the coast and will only fly back for a week or so at a time when absolutely necessary. In the summer, it's docked nearby so they're able to stay some nights in the house when they want to. Which is fine, and was agreed upon. \n\nMy mom always makes it a point to tell us that it's \"our house too\", and to treat it as such (move things around, organize, swap furniture etc.). My wife usually cooks and I usually do the dishes and clean the kitchen afterwards, that's the way we do things. Neither of us have a problem with leaving dishes in the sink until the next morning when it's usually (but I admit, not always) taken care of the next morning. My mom disagrees with this mindset. \n\nThe other night, I was attending regular weekly plans which usually run late and I don't get home until 11pm or so. I get home at 11:30pm and my wife has made dinner, left me a plate and gone to bed. She leaves dishes in the sink and used pans on the stove, which I am expected to clean up. Again, thats the way we normally do it. I decide I am tired and will just eat dinner and wait until the next morning to clean the dishes (I usually get up around 9-10am). \n\nMy mom is retired but works part time (basically for fun) 2 days a week in the summer, 8am-1pm. She gets up the morning after and decides she wants to make something for breakfast, but cant because of the dishes and pans in the sink and on the stove. She writes a note and leaves it on the counter, addressed to both of us. I paraphrase:\n\n\"This is not fair. This is MY kitchen, not YOUR kitchen. I couldnt make breakfast because of your dirty dishes in the sink. Don't let this happen again\"\n\nI wake up to my wife (who's angry and anxious after reading the note) handing me the note before leaving for work. My mom has already left for work, so I walk downstairs to angrily clean the kitchen, and my dad has already cleaned it all in an effort to keep the peace because my mom was apparently flipping her lid. \n\nThe wife and I feel like the note was petty and rude, and I wouldn't have been mad if she approached it better. I also feel like I have a right to leave dishes in the sink overnight if its really \"my house too\". This is not the first time my mom has flipped out about dishes in the sink, it seems to be one of the only things she has a real problem with. I try to explain to her that we're not going to live up to her expectations when it comes to the dishes, and that sometimes they're gonna sit in the sink until we get around to it. \n\nBut I'm willing to admit when I am wrong. So, am I the asshole?\n",

      "comment_text": "I can see both sides here.\n\nRegarding my own personal habits, I incline more towards Team OP than Team Mom. I'm disabled, so housework is a real effort. Even prepping vegetables or standing at the stove stirring a pot takes more strength than I can easily manage some days. So more often than not, the dirty dishes stay next to the sink until I get round to washing them. That might be the next morning, or sometimes even the next afternoon. I pace myself; I do it when I have sufficient energy. They do get rinsed and stacked, but they're not washed yet. Your mom would be horrified if she walked into my kitchen.\n\nHaving said that, it IS her house, despite her telling you that it's your house too. When she said that, she meant \"I don't mind if you make yourselves comfortable and move things around\". She did NOT mean \"I don't mind if you live like slobs\" (the definition of \"slob\" being whatever she chooses to define it as, of course).\n\nRight now, you are falling below the standards she expects. Whether that's fair or not isn't the point. When she's in the house, she gets to define the standards. You can relax a bit when she's away, but you'd better make damn sure everything is in order by the time she gets home.\n\nYou said you lost your previous living space \"a few years ago\". How close are you and your wife to getting a place of your own again? Because if you want the freedom of being able to live by your own standards instead of hers, you really, really need to get your own place.\n\nIf you COULD move out but you're choosing to continue living with your parents because it's cheap, then I'm sorry, this is the price you pay for it.\n\nA reluctant YTA.",

      "scenario_description": "I (20F) wanted to celebrate my 20th birthday in the best way possible with my friends while not wasting too much money. \n\nOur first idea was to book a hotel somewhere in our country near the beach but the prices were ridiculously expensive and bc most of us are still uni-students, we couldn’t afford it.\n\nI still wanted to make my birthday special since I never really celebrated it properly (the last time I did anything special was when I was like 11) and to have the chance to bring the friend group back together for a few days since we’ve all grown apart.\n\nI opened a group chat to discuss our options and the best one was to take an Airbnb that’s big enough for us all that would also be near the beach. We found the best Airbnb we could find, the price was good and the house by itself looked great.\n\nBut then, my friend Mia (21F) have announced in the group that if we decide to go to an Airbnb and not a hotel she’s not gonna go. I asked her why and she said she found Airbnb’s disgusting and non-classy. (Her exact words, she also said “I wouldn’t even step into an Airbnb because she doesn’t trust they even change the sheets.) I told her I’ve been to multiple Airbnb’s and they were all clean, and the reviews on the one we wanted were all good. She continued to argue so I told her that it’s my birthday and as much as I want everyone to be in it, I’m not going to bend to her conditions and pay a lot of money im trying to save.\n\nThere was a big drama (because everyone disagreed with her), we all have stopped talking in the group which made me think that now our plans would be cancelled because everyone were upset by the argument.\n\nI shared my bf (24M) about the situation and he decided to pull some strings and use some of his connections. He got us a huge discount on one of the best hotels in our country, but their condition was that we can’t be more than two people in each room. (They basically didn’t want us to take the big rooms that were meant for groups).\n\nWithout Mia, we were exactly six people so it was perfect. I told everyone about the situation in the group chat and for some reason Mia was sure one of our friends would give up their place so she could go.\n\nI’ve had enough with her attitude, so I straight up told her i don’t want her to come because if she does, we will be an un-even number and we will have to go to the Airbnb anyways. She cursed at me, left the group and haven’t talked to any of us since. We’re going to the hotel in two days and I just feel really bad with what I did and with how everything turned out because it was the last thing I wanted to happen. We are MIA’s only friends and all of us will be together without her.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n",

There will inevitably be some people for whom this would not be their first preference but they'll tolerate it for the sake of group harmony. And occasionally there will be someone, like Mia, for whom it is a deal-breaker.\n\nMia likes to pontificate on what's \"classy\" and what's not. Well, Mia, the classy thing to do when the group decides on something that is a deal breaker for you is to say \"OK, I'm going to have to bow out of this one because it's just not my thing. If I went, I think I'd be a drag on your weekend. I wouldn't be happy, and you wouldn't be happy. So I'll sit this one out, and hopefully I'll be able to join you for your next trip. Have a wonderful time!\"\n\nIt is NOT classy to cause such a commotion in the group chat that everyone gets upset and stops talking about it.\n\nConsequently, it is not surprising that Mia got left out of the alternate plans. Even if the hotel could accommodate an uneven number, I have a feeling that the friction Mia caused in the group chat would not make for a happy weekend.\n\nGo with a clear conscience.

She moved five hours away and makes little to no effort to keep up a friendship despite me often messaging her or asking to meet up when she visits home, which she treats like a chore and always feels “too tired” to meet up. She even started excluding me from gatherings with our larger group of mutual friends. I am not invited to the bachelorette party either which I was surprised by as we used to be close. \n\nAnyway, the destination wedding was going to cost me about $2000 to attend and a week of vacation from work. I decided not to go because I don’t think she is treating me like a good friend and even mentioned she just wants people there because her and her finance get a free room if they have enough rooms booked.

People grow and change, and discover they don't have as much in common any more.\n\nYou and this person are not friends any more. You are two people with a shared history, but you've drifted apart, and you now live separate lives. The reasons - who said or did what to whom, whether it was justified or not - don't particularly matter.\n\nWhat matters is that you are not obliged to drop $2000 on the wedding of a person with whom you are no longer friends.\n\n*is not speaking to me at all now (though she barely was speaking to me before).*\n\nSo your problem is pretty much solved. You don't even need to worry about whether to have one final farewell conversation or whether to just ignore her calls. She has decided that for you.

For some context I don’t care if people know but my mom has always been the type to tell all of my business to everyone. When I first got pregnant I asked her to not tell anyone yet because i wasnt sure if the baby would make it since it was only 6 weeks. I went to church and she had told everyone already. She has always been the type of person to tell everyone about me even the things which are obviously personal to me. She is not good at boundaries in any way. Even when I repeat them to the point where I have to dismiss myself from conversations. My main goal is to get her to understand my boundaries and one of them is I do not like people to know everything about me especially things that I am not comfortable with sharing. There are things I do tell my mom that it’s okay to share but this is one of the things I told her I am not comfortable with sharing yet. Also to add she talks to several people who I do not like. They overstep boundaries also and are not respectful to her or I.",

He sent a picture of the ring with a short message asking if my husband would be his best man when the time came and if I could take photos at the engagement since I have a background in photography. We both agreed to be there and were through the roof with excitement for both of them since we knew this is something they both wanted for a while.\n\nSomewhere around a week later my husband got a text saying “hey man we’re having a fire tonight. Want to come” sadly we where on our way to my sisters place at the time and because there was no mention of the engagement we decided to pass.\n\nAfter we got service a bunch of texts came in from my best friend with pictures and the video of jack proposing. My heart sank out of guilt for not being able to be there with or take the pictures I promised. When my husband opened his phone there wasn’t a single text from jack saying he was going to pop the question.\n\nI congratulated my friend and jack but was truly disappointed jack didn’t tell us tonight was the night even though he told everyone else there he was proposing. \n\nThe following day my friend asked me to come over for an engagement party , I was feeling very upset still so I decided not to go so I didn’t ruin her day. When I told her I had plans she told me if I didn’t go me and my husband would be removed from the wedding party.\n\nAm I the as*hole?\n",

If he *didn't* make it clear to you, he should have.\n\nIf Jack did expect you to take photos of the proposal, he stuffed up in not telling you he was planning to propose on that specific night. Jack should not have expected you to read his mind and know that this was intended to be the proposal, nor to drop your plans for that very day just to be there. I note you said you were already on route to your sister's place, so this really was very late notice.\n\nIf this event is important enough to them to require your skills as an experienced photographer, it's important enough for Jack to organize everything in advance and make sure you know about it so that you can bring your equipment.\n\nSo. At this point, you had hurt feelings, and some degree of irritation, possibly justified, that Jack hadn't made things clear in advance.\n\nThen they invited you to the engagement. The gracious thing to do at this point, which you should have done, would have been to talk to them about the proposal stuff-up, work out how it happened and what is expected of everyone so you can avoid a similar misunderstanding in future, then call it water under the bridge and go to the engagement party and take the photos.\n\nInstead:\n\n*I was feeling very upset still so I decided not to go so I didn’t ruin her day.*\n\nI'm not buying that. I think you decided not to go because you wanted to nurse your hurt feelings and make your point without using your words and telling them why you were unhappy.\n\nThen:\n\n*she told me if I didn’t go me and my husband would be removed from the wedding party.*\n\nSo she has decided to retaliate in a very childish manner.\n\nYou've both decided to sulk about it. You're both behaving badly, and despite calling her your friend, it doesn't sound like a very deep friendship to me.",

      "scenario_description": "I (f17) was working on my school assignment which required me to make a podcast. Soooo the house was really loud, and it wasn't fair for everyone if I had them keep quiet, so I headed out to my roof deck.\n\nFor some context, my room is the third floor, it's like a little loft, no doors to my room, its just straight up walk up the stairs my bed is there.\n\nSo I was working on the assignment, voice recording myself reading the script, and I was probably 30-40 minutes into it. Sitting on a yoga mat, facing away from the clear doors. I was in the zone, voice recording myself, rehearsing, yada yada.\n\nThen my mom slowly opened the door and said, \"hey OP\".\n\nWhen she spoke, I jumped a little as my head snapped back to see her. Obviously, I was really surprised because I was super focused.\n\nHeres where I probably was the asshole, my words were not the greatest.\n\nI went, \"oh my gosh, what the fuck?\" really really quickly, eyes wide, it was more like I breathed it out.\n\nThat was all it took for my mom, whose face was mellow and calm looking, to turn angry.\n\nShe slammed the clear doors closed, glared at me, then stormed down the stairs.\n\nI attempted yelling down the stairs after processing what happened, and yelled, \"MOM! I'M SORRY! I WAS JUST REALLY SURPRISED BECAUSE I WAS WORKING!\"\n\nSo AITA???\n\n\\*\\*right after reading through what I wrote, I seem like the a-hole to myself. oh no.\\*\\*\n\nEDIT : after working on my project (and writing this lol) I went inside to find a package, it was for father's day. Earlier she had told me she got it same -day delivery and was super excited. Me saying 'wtf' must have been so rude. reflecting more and more, I seem like the a-hole to myself now....",

      "scenario_description": "I (F24) love feeding people.\n\nI love cooking,baking and over all making food. And I love watching people eat my food. I make good food too. So much so that I have been told by almost everyone to consider going for culinary. \n\nI love my friend group and hang out with them a lot. It's a mixture of both male and females. \n\nWhenever I get the chance to make food, I make them food. If I ever go back to my hometown, I always bring them a lot of local sweets and local dishes. \n\nI was the one that made them try carrot cake. It was my chocolate chip cookies they proclaimed were the best they have ever tasted. It was my fish dish they craved when they wanted good food. \n\nAnd I was always happy to make food for them. I did not charge them anything because I just did it because I wanted to.\n\nIf they requested a particular dish, I make it for them. \n\nIf they know I am making something for them, they buy my groceries. But usually, I just cook on my own volition and just invite them after im done.\n\nRecently, one of my guy friends confronted me. Apparently me constantly feeding them made him feel uncomfortable. \n\n\"You're always feeding us and making us food. It makes us feel indebted and uncomfortable. It feels like we owe you something and need to pay it back. I know you are depressed and use cooking as a way to cope, but maybe dont always make us food. It's tiring for us to be with you.\"\n\nI was honestly heartbroken. I didn't know they felt that way. I asked the rest of the friend group if what he said was true. \n\nThey disagreed. They said that my generosity and mama bear nature was one of their favorite things about me. That my food comforted them. They said they dont want to seem like they're taking advantage of me, so I can stop when I want to,but they still appreciate it.\n\nBut the guy friend stills insist that I shouldn't cross what he has already told me he isn't comfortable with. \n\nI dont want to make anyone uncomfortable. I want to be easy to approach for everyone. I dont know what to do.\n\n",

I know you are depressed and use cooking as a way to cope, but maybe dont always make **us** food. It's tiring for **us** to be with you.\"\n\nAnd yet, you asked the rest of your friend group, and they all disagreed with him. I assume they are being truthful, especially because it seems they went out of their way to reassure you.\n\nSo what's with this \"we\" and \"us\" business? Does GuyFriend speak for anyone other than himself?\n\nIf not, then:\n\n(a) you would be justified in continuing to do the cooking you enjoy so much, that has the bonus of making nearly all your friends happy, because GuyFriend is the only person made uncomfortable by it. He's a big boy. He can absent himself from situations where you're sharing food with others.\n\nand\n\n(b) GuyFriend should own his opinions rather than pretending they're shared by anyone else. He can start by knocking off the \"us\" and \"we\" shit.\n\nAn apocryphal quote often attributed to Mark Twain: \"Only kings, editors, and people with tapeworm have the right to refer to themselves as 'we' \".",

It isn’t insulated, it leaks, and squirrels basically have squatter rights. I don’t store anything there on purpose. I also told her that people always say they’ll “pick it up soon,” and then never do. Somehow the person doing the favor becomes the villain.\n\nShe kept pushing. I offered options:  \n– Rent a storage unit  \n– Get a U-Haul, take the couch home, and have her kids drive up and get her car  \n– Leave it at her dad’s and take the risk\n\nHer niece even borrowed a trailer to bring it to me. All that, just to keep it out of her siblings’ hands.\n\nI finally said yes, but I was crystal clear. Two weeks. After that, I could do whatever I wanted with it.  \nShe said absolutely. Her kids would be there that weekend to pick it up.\n\nThey never came.\n\nI called a few times that first year.  \n“Oh yeah, we’ll come get it.”  \nCrickets.  \nIn one of my “please get your couch” calls, she said, “I’m a Sagittarius. We’re not good at this stuff.”  \nI’m still not sure what that has to do with picking up your couch.\n\nI tried again in year two. Same story. After that, I gave up. She never once brought it up on her own.\n\nAround year three and a half, I had construction work happening. The crew backed a trailer into the garage and accidentally crushed the couch. When we looked closer, it was already moldy and torn apart by squirrels. The workers felt bad. I told them not to worry. It had been sitting there for years.\n\nWe even discussed whether I should tell her. Everyone agreed there wasn’t much point. She hadn’t mentioned it in over three years.\n\nSo I didn’t.\n\nFast forward to this year — now year six. I mention I’m cleaning out the garage and she casually says, “Oh, I need to come get that couch.”\n\nMe: “It’s gone. The squirrels got it.”  \nHer: “What?”  \nMe: “Yeah. The garage isn’t insulated. They love it in there.”  \nHer: “I had no idea.”  \nMe: “You did. You just forgot. And I said two weeks.”\n\nShe hasn’t spoken to me since. Unfriended. Full stop.\n\nMeanwhile, I lived around that couch. I broke my toe on it. I had to work around it constantly. I paid to have it hauled away. It took up space I didn’t have for three and a half years. The first time she brought it up was in year six.\n\nSo I’m really asking:  \nShould I have told her back when it got ruined, even though she hadn’t asked about it in years?  \nAt year six, should I have just said “sure, come get it” and played along, even though I doubt she would have?  \nOr was this always going to end the same way, no matter what I did?\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nFriend asked to store her dad’s couch “for two weeks.” I said no, then agreed with a firm limit. She left it for 3.5 years. Couch was destroyed. I tossed it and didn’t tell her. She finally mentioned it in year six. Now she’s upset. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Over the last 5-ish years, I, 30F distanced myself from my toxic aunt 53F (we’ll call her Tina) & it has gotten to where I refuse to be under the same roof as her. My cousin 31M (we’ll call him Sam), is getting married next year and his bride-to-be is having a bridal shower. To clarify, Tina is not Sam’s mother. Both Tina and myself are invited, but I refuse to go if she attends.\nI do not expect anyone to make the decision of who to invite or give any type of ultimatums. I just simply let them know I would not be attending. \n\nA little backstory, Tina is in active addiction and has been for the last 15-20 years. She has liver failure amongst a whole list of medical diagnoses. She takes advantage of my elderly grandparents(her parents). She has ruined many holidays, birthdays and other big events like graduations. She hasn’t worked in 10+ and lives with her boyfriend but crashes at my grandparents off and on. It got to the point I was getting called to my grandparents almost weekly to handle the situation because they were afraid to, ending in law enforcement being called 8+ times. She tried to get me fired from my job & has stolen from me. I did all I could and got her in to treatment 3 times and was there to visit each time. She continues to lie about her sobriety, takes advantage of my grandparents & tries to play the victim in every situation. \nI got to the point that I needed to cut her off completely because my grandparents would just show up to my house with her in tow knowing I didn’t want that. It was something I felt had to be done for my own sanity. Since refusing to be under the same roof as her I have had to skip many holidays and celebrations but the rest of the family finally saw I was serious about my boundaries. Again, I always thank them for the invite but kindly let them know I will have to pass. I never get upset that I can’t be there because of something I felt I needed to do. Passing on attendance is always met with guilt trips on why I should just suck it up and stop holding a grudge. Things like “she’s your aunt” “we only live once.” \n\nSam’s soon-to-be bride is having a bridal shower thrown for her and I let them know that I would love to make it but likely would not if Tina is going, but would love to meet up with the two of them and give her a gift and just hangout. Now they, including Sam’s sister, are trying to guilt trip me and saying that I am hurting their feelings because I can’t just let go.\n\nAITA and should I just suck it up and go? ",

I mean, she sounds truly awful, but it's not our business why. \"I dislike her and trust me, I have good reason to\" would be good enough for me. I have a sister I dislike. The reasons why are not Redditors' business.\n\n2. You are NTA for avoiding Tina, as long as you never say to anyone \"You can't invite Tina\". That would be controlling. But it is OK to find out whether Tina will be attending and then decide not to go. That's exactly what I do regarding my sister. I make an exception only for weddings and funerals. Everything else, including Christmas, I bow out of if she will be there. I started doing that during COVID lockdown and just kept on doing it even when restrictions eased. And believe me, life is good. I have plenty of opportunities to see the family members I want to see, while avoiding her.\n\n3. *Now they, including Sam’s sister, are trying to guilt trip me and saying that I am hurting their feelings because I can’t just let go.* You are not responsible for their feelings. You made the decision you made because of you, not to spite them. They will have to manage their own feelings.",

      "scenario_description": "So some quick background on the situation, my mother and I reconciled over the previous holiday season and started speaking and meeting again for the first time in six years after she had cheated on my father and my parents got divorced. In the 7 months since she first reached out to me via my sister, things had progressed well to the point where my wife and I felt comfortable inviting her to our wedding. The one outstanding issue/ disagreement we still have though was that I have zero interest in ever meeting her new husband Tim who was the man she was cheating on my father with. She has made several attempts to try and introduce him to me however each time I rejected it and made it clear I have zero interest in ever meeting or interacting with the man. Anyways  fast forward to Monday on my wedding night and as my wife is looking through some of our wedding gifts she notices one is labeled from “Tim”. Later on I approached my mother and asked if Tim got my wife and I a wedding gift and she said he had and hoped it could be somewhat of an olive branch between him and I. I thanked her and Tim for the gift but later on after checking with my wife I approached my brother  and gave him the gift and told him to drop it off at my mother and Tim’s house since I wasn’t going to accept it. He took it and apparently dropped it off at their house tonight. Upon seeing my brother drop the gift off ,my mother called me upset that I had refused to accept Tim’s present. I told her I was simply maintaining the same stance that I have had the entire time regarding Tim which is that I want nothing to do with him. \n\nSo AITA for rejecting my mothers new husbands wedding present?\n\nEdit: I have seen some ask why I want nothing to do with Tim and let me put it like this. The most obvious reason is because he is the man my mom cheated with but the other reason is I’ve only ever had one interaction with him and given it ended in a physical altercation and near fight because of him not caring about the rule of him not being allowed at my parents house while my mom was not present (this was while my parents were separated and in the process of going through the divorce) I see no reason why I should have any respect for the man or even bother with acknowledging his existence given nothing positive will come of it for both him and I.",

I will be making arrangements to return it to him.\"\n\n\\* Involving your brother in this awkwardness. Why did you get him to do your dirty work? It's nothing to do with him.

      "scenario_description": "I F19 graduated over a year ago now and live in an area where jobs are scarce and haven’t been able to get a job. Due to this I’ve made sure to clean the house daily, try to walk the dogs daily and I make sure my parents know they can leave my younger sister or dogs home with me whenever they want/need. \n\nBut I feel like my stepdad is constantly finding things I’m doing wrong, I forget to bring the bins in? He tells me I need to help out more. I forget to empty the dishwasher? He asks me when I’m going to start helping out more, despite the face the rest of the house is spotless. \n\nNow today he really pissed me off, its winter here and every day I have been scrubbing mud off the tiles and carpet because of my dogs, and that extra work on top of making sure i do everything else has been draining my motivation to clean my own spaces, (My room and my lounge-room) so I decided to take today for myself and clean up those spaces before the rest of the house. \n\n  \nI had finished my room and lounge-room a little bit before he got home, so I vacuumed the house and by the time he got home I was in my bathroom cleaning my sink, I could IMMEDIATELY hear him start scoffing in the kitchen, then I heard him take out the bins while swearing under his breathe, I ignored it and kept cleaning the sink but he ended up in the doorway of the bathroom and asked me “Are you going to help out AT ALL?!” Which I was about to explain I was cleaning my room, lounge-room and now bathroom today but he didn’t let me get a word in at all. He said “I just took the bins out and I’m now doing the dishes“ \n\nI said to him that he didn’t have to do the dishes and that I‘ll do them once I’m done what I’m doing, he just scoffed and said “Nope I’m already doing them!” and walked back to the kitchen, still swearing and mumbling under his breathe.\n\n  \nI’m sitting on my couch typing this, he’s still mumbling swears under his breath and I’m just trying to ignore it, AITA in this situation?? Please tell me what I’ve done wrong.",

      "scenario_description": "I know that I(18f) and my boyfriend (19m) are a long way from moving in together but oh well this kinda stuck with me. The other day we were exploring the isles of Walmart and talking about how we would decorate our house if we moved in together. Bickering about colors and what not. When eventually we came to the bedding portion and I mentioned how one thing I wouldn’t compromise on was a mattress pad. For a little context I have really bad back problems including scoliosis and he knows this, I have struggled with back pain all my life and am currently in physical therapy for it. He then stated that we would absolutely not have a mattress pad as he cannot fall asleep on one. When I expressed it was for my back he seemed not to care and kept saying he needs a firm mattress to fall asleep and we can’t have a mattress pad (hard mattresses hurt my back) we ended up arguing in the isle and he said something about how mattresses pads would give him back problems I told him that’s not how that works and he made fun of the slight lisp I got when I said it. I got really frustrated and ended up storming away to be by myself for a little while. He ended up finding me later and we didn’t mention anything about it again. I know I should probably try to look at it from his perspective as I know he struggles with sleep but it hurts my back and I don’t want to develop more problems and I feel like we could have talked it out without him shutting me down. Outside of this everything is perfect and it might be a little too soon to say this but I really do see myself spending my life with him. (I’ve known him for 7 years but we’ve only dated for 3) \nEdit: \nChat I’m gonna be honest he read through this before I posted it and we had a good laugh as we both agreed we were dramatic and came to several compromises, we just wanted to see what other people would think of it from my perspective.

(Yes, you can still have a very fulfilling sex life even if you go sleep in separate beds or even separate rooms after FunSexyTime is done for the night. Many couples do. You just don't hear them talk about it much, because for the last 60 years or so western society has made such people think there's something wrong with them.)\n\n... and then you said:\n\n*he made fun of the slight lisp I got when I said it. I got really frustrated and ended up storming away to be by myself for a little while*\n\n...which is clearly a sore point for you.\n\nNote that it needn't be. A lisp is nothing to be ashamed of. But for whatever reason, it *is* something you're sensitive about. And I'm guessing he *knows* it's a sore spot, and he deliberately poked it anyway.\n\nOnly you know whether he did this on purpose to hurt you or at least rattle you. And if he did, that's a massive red flag. If he's done it once, he'll do it again.\n\nOP, you are so young. You both still have a lot of growing up to do. You will both mature and change - hopefully in the same direction, in ways that make you still compatible, but not necessarily. Don't tie your future to his just yet.",

      "scenario_description": "I (18m) and my girlfriend (17f) had been together for almost two years. A few weeks ago, we broke up for a multitude of reasons on both sides. Despite this, we agreed to try and be friends as we are in the same social group.\n\nNearing her birthday in December, I saw that one of our favorite bands were playing locally this coming August. To surprise her, I bought us tickets as a birthday present, they cost around £250 ($335). As you can imagine, this is a lot of money for somebody of my age.\n\nCut to a few days ago, she asked me when i would give her the tickets so that she and her sister could go. I told her that I still wanted to go and didn’t want to give them away. She got very upset at this and hasn’t talked to me since.\n\nShould I still give her the tickets or is there another solution to come up with?",

It would represent many weeks of saving.\n\nIt was, and is, an amount that I would only spend on someone I am very close to. An ex partner does not fall into that category.\n\nSince you have already bought the tickets, and presumably you still want to go yourself, what you MAY want to consider doing if you wish to keep her as a friend is to go see the band with her anyway, even though she is not your girlfriend any more. That way it would still be her belated birthday present.\n\nI have often gone to an event or place with an ex-partner even though there is zero romantic interest between us any more. I did that because we still had a shared interest in music or art or theater or whatever, an interest I didn't share with anyone else, and would otherwise have to go alone. (I don't buy their ticket for them, though - we each pay for our own.)\n\nNow, I predict commenters are going to jump on my comment and say \"Why should he?\", so I will make it crystal clear: you would NOT be the asshole if you chose not to attend with her. It's entirely up to you.\n\nGiven that she has responded with the silent treatment, you may decide you'd rather take someone else, or sell the second ticket. You have every right to do that. But personally, I'd cut her a little slack for being upset and not talking to you, because I know she is disappointed, and she's only 17 and every disappointment is the end of the world.\n\nThat doesn't make her entitled to the ticket, though, and it most certainly doesn't make her entitled to BOTH tickets and to take her sister instead of you.",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for not wanting to wait at the hospital during my mom’s surgery?\n\nI (16f) have always been my mom’s (45f) keeper. When my grandmother died in 6th grade, I couldn’t even process her death because I was too busy taking care of my mom—cleaning, comforting her, and holding everything together.\n\nLast summer, when my mom had surgery, I stayed at the hospital the entire time. Afterward, I helped her bathe, went on mobility walks with her, and made sure she was okay. On top of that, my mom and I were taking care of my grandpa (now deceased), but honestly, it was like I became a second nurse. I spent my whole junior year juggling school, caregiving, and cleaning. Every hospital visit, I was there. When she had to work, I stayed back with him to make sure he was safe and monitored.\n\nRight before I left for Nationals, we had to rush my grandpa to the hospital again. I stayed up all night with zero sleep and got on a plane the next day—only to return and find out he had passed away. I was devastated.\n\nNow, my mom is having another surgery due to a hard-to-reach tumor in her stomach. The night before, I asked her if it would be okay for me to stay home until the surgery is over—then I’d come to the hospital and step into my usual role as her caretaker. I even told her that if she truly needed me there, I would come.\n\nShe blew up at me and called me selfish. I get that she’s scared, but I feel like I’ve already done so much, and now I’m just asking for a little breathing room. My mom is all I have, and I think she sometimes uses that to her advantage.\n\nAITA for asking to stay home during the actual procedure?\n",

      "comment_text": "You are NTA for all the reasons the commenters here have mentioned.\n\nBut I'm curious: how long is this surgery likely to take? Because **while your mom is under anesthesia, she will not know whether you are at the hospital or not.** Therefore her demand that you stay at the hospital the whole time is not reasonable. There's no point, especially if the surgery is likely to take many hours.\n\nYou've already said you'll be there to support after it's over. That should be sufficient for her. (Not to mention, you're already carrying a load far heavier than any 16-year-old should be expected to.)\n\nAllow me to offer a personal anecdote to show I've been in your mom's shoes, and I STILL think she's being unreasonable:\n\nSeveral years ago I had major, complicated cancer surgery, expected to take 12 hours or more. My prognosis was good, in that they weren't expecting me to die on the operating table, but still, it was very major surgery. (And life-threatening complications did set in, but several days later - not during the surgery itself. But that's a whole 'nother story, and I won't go into it here.)\n\nMy family was understandably worried, and to make things even more fraught, the hospital where I was having the surgery was the exact same hospital where one of my parents had died a few years before.\n\nMy surviving parent was therefore desperately worried about my surgery, and traumatized by the history we had with this hospital. (No reflection on the hospital. It's an excellent one. My late parent was just too ill to be saved.) Not only had my parent lost a spouse in this place, they were now afraid they were going to lose their daughter here too! Their plan was to sit in the hospital corridor all day, from early in the morning until as long as it took, waiting for the moment when I came out of anesthesia.\n\nI explained patiently that they shouldn't spend the day sitting on an uncomfortable hospital chair (my parent is very elderly), in the very place which held so many bad memories for our family, and all in an effort to be \"supportive\", a support which I would never know about because I would be under anesthesia the whole time.\n\nWhen my parent still said they wanted to be there, I knew I'd have to prevent it at all costs. I asked one of my siblings to take the day off work and spend it with my parent, doing nice relaxing things. My sibling readily agreed. (They were as worried about my parent as I was.)\n\nThe day went well. My sibling and parent went out for lunch, went to a movie, walked through parks, and did other calming, distracting, enjoyable things. My sibling phoned the hospital for regular updates about me, and finally drove my parent in shortly before midnight as I was coming out of the anesthesia. I got all the support I needed, and my parent also got the support THEY needed for their anxiety.\n\nOP, YOU matter just as much as your mother. YOUR mental and physical health require support too. Please make sure you are accessing all the resources that are available to you. If you're not sure what they are, please ask for help. Perhaps your school could offer advice or assistance? Or the hospital social worker?\n\nI wish you both well.",

      "scenario_description": "My wife (F 25) and I (M 26) are expecting a baby girl due in November. We are both so excited for it! I’ve been talking to her through my wife’s belly, being excited feeling kicks, all of the fun stuff. 3 weeks ago we scheduled the 20 week ultrasound (it’ll be closer to 22 weeks).\n\nThe last week and a half my grandfather’s health had been slowly diminishing. I had a talk with my father and family and were told that sometime within a week of his passing we would have the funeral. This made my wife and I have to talk about the plan. I was asked to be a pallbearer at the funeral. She said she’d want to stay home with the dogs so we didn’t have to board them and that I could go by myself to the 4-4.5 hour trip up north to my fathers home town.\n\nUnfortunately, my grandfather passed away late last night/early this morning. I called my father to make sure he was okay which he was holding on as much as one would when your father passes away. But I was told the funeral would be held at 10 am on Wednesday… this just so happens to be the exact same day that my wife has the ultrasound.\n\nMy wife is now upset that I plan to go to my grandfathers funeral instead of go to the ultrasound appointment. I said “well we could FaceTime? But it’s my grandfather” I know FaceTime isn’t the same. But she said “yeah, but this is your daughter”. Now she is mad and upset at me. I’m emotionally torn from this because I’m so excited for my baby girl but also really sad about my grandfather..\n\nI just.. I want to know if I’m the asshole here. My wife’s feeling are always going to be valid, but I feel like mine aren’t being considered in this situation. I don’t know.",

      "scenario_description": "I'm so upset and I do not know if I'm in the wrong. \n\nI'm 27 F. My father passed away of cancer back in 2018, when I was 20. \n\nLast weekend, my mother re-married. I get along well enough with her new husband, he's a cool guy in general, treats me and my mother well. He also has a 13 year old daughter from a previous relationship, as he's been married and divorced his ex. They have a 50/50 custody split of their daughter. \n\nDuring the wedding on Saturday, everyone had fun, I even shed some tears of joy for my mom. But Sunday, something shifted. My cousin asked if I am going to call my mom's new husband dad. I obviously said no. I already had a dad and was a fully grown woman by the time he came into my mother's life. \n\nAfter that comment, my mother and her sister pulled me aside, and started yelling at me to stop bringing up my father in front of her new husband because... he's jealous? Of a dead man? His ex is alive and they see each other every other weekend to pass the kid but he's jealous of a dead man? I basically told them to get off me. That I do not do it deliberately but my father had been my father for 20 years and naturally I bring him up sometimes in passing. Especially to my younger cousin who was only 7 when my dad passed away and barely remembers him.\n\nMy aunt went into a whole tangent how \"my dad was important to me but is not important to anybody else anymore and I should let go and move on instead of talking about him because everyone else is.\" That, in turn, made me cry and I didn't speak to either of them for the rest of the day.\n\nAITA for bringing up my dad sometimes? Is it reasonable of my mother's husband to be jealous of a literal corpse..?",

Nothing is ever good enough. Or nothing is ever as good as his stuff. \n\nI decided to have a small cookout at my house. He has made comments about its location and quality many times before. Nonetheless, we’re planning to have good food, drinks, and a whole lot of other stuff to spend some time with our friends and relax a little, and they’re both invited. My bestie is worried about her boyfriend’s cat allergies. I have two cats. Both hide when people are over. She asked me to lock them in the room for the day to not upset his allergies. He has been to my house twice now and has never complained about my cats. \n\nI simply told her no. After she persisted, I reminded her he’s been around them, and their fur, which lingers around at all times in the past. I asked what he did then to manage it. She said take Benadryl. I recommend he take it again before/after his visit. She persisted. So I said I’m not locking my cats in a room for the day. And so far that’s been that. \n\nAITA? I’m not sure if my dislike of her boyfriend is clouding my judgement. But I also think of how panicked and uncomfortable my cats will be, and it seems unreasonable to request that from me. Also, their discomfort really doesn’t seem worth his company. I don’t know… AITA??",

But this guy doesn't fall into either of those categories.\n\nHe has not demonstrated many good qualities, either as a friend or as a guest. His allergy appears to be manageable. And your cats live there too. They're not inconveniences to be shoved out of the way for any situation short of life-threatening (to them, or to someone else).\n\nSo if he were my friend's boyfriend, then as far as I'm concerned, if he continues to visit my house, he can accept my house, and my cats, and me, as he finds us. I'm not going out of my way for him. If he doesn't like it, he's free not to visit. And if that makes me an asshole, then you and I are both assholes.\n\nI'm also interested to note that he has said nothing at all about the cats (despite complaining about everything else), and it's actually your friend who has been doing the pushing.

      "scenario_description": "About a month ago, my childhood best friend got married to a beautiful woman he's been dating for about 4 years. The night before, I organized a bachelor party for about a dozen of his closest friends who were all coming to the wedding. Since I live in a high COL area and am financially well off, I had no problem covering the cost up front for dinner and bottle service at a club when I scheduled it. In fact, I event commented to the guys the night of that I paid for everything already.\n\nOn the night of the event, we all had a great time and the total bill came out to about $7k. I make plenty of money and I can easily afford it knowing that I threw my childhood friend an amazing bachelor party. For the last few weeks, I've been really busy at work and only recently reached out to the group of guys about paying for their fair share of the bill. Obviously, I don't want to be stuck with a $7k bill if I don't have to considering I didn't drink or eat that entire amount which was consumed by the entire group.\n\nSince it's been about a month since the bachelor party, I know some of the guys are annoyed that I'm hitting them up for money to cover the bill. Some don't even drink but I still split the bill into 12 equal parts (minus the groom) so we all are paying the same amount. I feel that their attendance and consumption of these items (food and alcohol) means they should reimburse me for the expenses. AITA?",

I really do appreciate it but growing up he always said that when my sister and I got married we’d each get fifteen thousand dollars to use however we wanted. Whether it was for a big wedding, eloping, saving for a house, it was supposed to be our choice.\n\nMy sister got married a couple years ago and had a big traditional wedding. My dad paid for everything with his credit card and she tracked all the costs in a spreadsheet. It ended up being about fifteen thousand.\n\nNow I’m engaged and my fiancé and I decided we want to elope and keep it super simple so we can save for a house. But now my dad is acting kind of weird about the money. He doesn’t really like the elopement idea and keeps saying we should just use his credit card and track expenses like my sister did.\n\nThe thing is we are not planning to spend anywhere near the full amount. I was hoping he would just give us the money like he always said so we could use it how we want. I get that maybe it feels different for him if he is not directly paying for stuff, but it kind of feels like we only get the full amount if we do things his way…. !? \n\nAm I being a spoiled brat for not wanting to follow the exact same plan my sister did?",

You and your fiancé actually sound very mature and sensible.\n\nBut it's your dad's money, not yours. Fair or not, he gets to decide. If for some reason he has his heart set on a big splashy wedding (heaven knows why, but each to their own), and nothing short of that will satisfy him, you can't make him spend it the way you want.\n\nWhat you can do is sit down with him, thank him for his generosity in being willing to give you anything at all, and explain your reasoning. (Leave your sister out of it. \"But you spent $15,000 on her, so I should get that too!\" is not going to help your case, and WILL make you sound resentful and entitled.)\n\nTell your dad how important home ownership is to you and your fiancé, how it will help set a solid foundation for your married life and the family you may wish to have one day.\n\nIn my country, house prices are going through the roof, and rapidly becoming unaffordable for young couples on an average wage. Is that also the case where you live? Then tell him that. Tell him you fear never being able to afford a home of your own if house prices keep increasing the way they have been. Tell him how frustrating it would be to spend this money on a single day, when the money could be contributing to something so much more lasting and meaningful to you.\n\nBut also ASK him why he feels the way he does. WHY does he want the big wedding? WHY is he uncomfortable with the idea of an elopement? And listen, really LISTEN to his answers. He may have a reason that isn't obvious to you or to me.\n\nI can't promise that this will solve your problem, but at least the two of you will understand each other a bit better.\n\nBest of luck.",

I sure as hell wouldn't be moving in with him at this stage.\n\n*He keeps making up reasons why he doesn't want to give her stuff back and be done once and for all.*\n\nOh, I'm sure he has LOTS of reasons. Some of them might actually be true.\n\nBut the reasons are irrelevant. If you attempt to argue against one reason, he'll just come up with another. \"She's too busy.\" \"I'm too busy.\" \"It's not convenient.\" \"She lives too far away.\" \"I don't feel like sorting through it all right now.\" \"I kind of like her stuff.\" \"Some of it is stuff we can use.\" \"There's room for it here, so why are you so bothered?\"\n\nDon't get caught up in the weeds of those reasons. Just keep saying calmly \"I'm not moving in until it's gone.\" If he really wants you to move in, he'll get rid of it. My suspicion is that he doesn't.\n\nIn a separate comment you wrote:\n\n*I contacted her but she refused to meet up and get her stuff, but when I mentioned throwing it away she said \"see what happens bitch\" and hung up.*\n\nNo. NoNoNoNoNo. BAD idea. Stay out of this. Do not contact his ex. Do not suggest throwing her stuff away, not to her, not to him. It's between the two of them. Your involvement should be limited to telling him \"I\"m not moving in until it's gone.\"\n\nYou are currently NTA, but you're getting awfully close to the asshole line by contacting his ex. You would definitely be the AH if you move in with him anyway, if you nag him about it incessantly or make demands or threats, or if you attempt to contact her again.",

      "scenario_description": "Hi 24M. I know this needs context, so I'll try and make it simple. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are just getting to the point of taking showers with each other while we're at each others places. The current problem I'm having is that I was on the toilet doing my business, when I was done I did the required paper work and then washed my hands. That all sounds normal to me. My girlfriend was in the bathroom with me, do to us getting ready to take a shower together. \n\nShe watched me wash my hands and asked me what I was doing, then scolded me for it. He logic was that since we were getting in the shower, washing my hands was pointless. I thought she was joking, so I laughed and said that was gross. I'm not touching anything with my soiled hands like that. She interpreted that as me calling her gross. \n\nSo I had to ask, does she always get right into the shower after using the toilet without washing them first? Apparently she doesn't wash her hand. She just gets right into the shower. Now I'm somehow an asshole because I don't want to spread my poop germs around my bathroom more than what flushing already does. \n\nNow it's turned into an argument. We didn't shower together and instead of having a nice day like we planed, I drove her home.\n\nI don't get it, who doesn't wash their hand immediately after wiping? If I'm home, I don't even pull my pants up until I wash my hands. \n\nI asked a few guy friends about it and they're all on my side, so I thought it might be a girl thing. So I called the only girls in my life i can ask such a stupid question. First i tried my older sister 38F, to which i got scolded for even considering not washing my hands. The lady practically raised me. Then I tried my younger sister 22F, she was on my girlfriends side. So I don't know.\n\n  \nAITA for washing my hands after using the bathroom even though I was getting in the shower anyways? ",

      "comment_text": "NTA.\n\nI probably wouldn't have bothered washing my hands if I was about to get in the shower, but I'm not you.\n\nI can think of only two reasons why a person should not wash their hands if they don't need to: 1. if the area where you live is in drought and water is severely restricted, OR 2. if you are washing excessively and compulsively because of OCD, and you're damaging your skin as a result. (OCD runs in my family. I have a relative who is a compulsive washer. It's not pretty.)\n\nNeither of these things apply in your case? Then you're fine. Go ahead and wash your hands whenever you want.\n\nWhat concerns me more about your post is that instead of shrugging off your hand washing as a funny little quirk, and part of what makes you interesting and lovable, your girlfriend escalated it into a big issue, She scolded you, and made you feel abnormal and bad. This caused you to argue, to change your plans for the day, and to come here and ask whether you did something wrong.\n\nAll this, over something that really did not matter.\n\nTHAT is not good. You sound like you're still in the early stages of this relationship, and already she is blowing up insignificant things into major dramas. What will happen next time she disagrees with you about something? And the time after that, and the time after that? Is this the sort of relationship you want? You should give some thought to this.",

      "scenario_description": "\nI, 21M, wanna go meet my gf, 22F, who lives about 2 hours (via a flight) away. We've been together for 2.5 years, known each other for 3 years now, all Long Distance. I'm in the last year of my 5 year degree, which requires me to complete my Master's thesis. I've decided to do my thesis abroad, in the US at a pretty good college. \n\nBefore I go for my year long thesis, I wanna meet my girlfriend one last time. Things are uncertain, and I'm not sure if we'll last over the next year, so this would effectively be the last time we meet (unless we work it out somehow). We've met a few times (around 6-7 times), each time lasting for no more than a few hours. I wanna spend 1 full day with her before leaving. She won't be able to come meet me there in the US due to her academics and family. \n\nI've told my parents everytime I've gone to meet her or when she's come to meet me. They refused to let me go, citing that the town she's in isn't safe, or that they're not comfortable with the idea because they weren't allowed to meet during their time. \n\nAITA to be pissed off and to be thinking of going without informing them? \n\nI've been somewhat of an ideal kid, near independent, great grades in school, at a great university and my thesis at a great college abroad, fairly good internships which earn me pretty good money (by my country's standards), and just overall being mostly transparent with my parents. I feel like the reasoning of not being comfortable doesn't make any sense cause I can do the same once I'm abroad, no one's gonna be supervising me there and that me asking for permission instead of going there without letting them know shows that I respect them as well. \n\nTldr; I gotta go abroad for my thesis for a year, won't be able to meet my LDR girlfriend during that time, wanna go to meet gf and spend a full day with her before leaving, parents disapprove, feeling pissed and considering going anyways. \n\nEdit 1: Me, parents and girlfriend are all based in India\n\nEdit 2: Being from a South Asian country, the stereotype of parents being overly involved in their kid's life holds true for my family as well. And I have mostly been a \"good kid\", but I think it's high time I get to make my own decisions. That's what's causing the conflicting feelings and doubt. This would be my first time actively choosing to go against what my parents have asked of me in a pretty big way (at least for me), so yeah there's some doubt. I just made this post to be exposed to various POVs and opinions. ",

Strictly speaking, you don't need your parents' blessing to do anything you want to do, and you certainly don't need their permission. Short of locking you in your room, they can't physically prevent you from going.\n\nBut I realize there are cultural differences at play here, that might not apply in the countries of most people reading this forum (including my country).\n\nIf you defied them and went anyway, do they have the power to make your life very unpleasant afterwards? For example, will they be funding your studies in the US? If so, would they cut off your source of funding if they found out? Would they banish you from the family forever?\n\nOr would they just bad-mouth you to all your relatives, who would then roll their eyes and sympathize with your parents and say \"Young people today. No respect for their elders. Why, back in my day...\"\n\nIn short, what would be the consequences, if any, of seeing your girlfriend against their wishes?\n\nYou would be NTA either way, but try to make the decision with a clear understanding of what the fallout might be and whether you can live with it.",

      "scenario_description": "I’m the MOH planning an 18-girl bachelorette. In January, I started the group chat and put down ~$7k for the Airbnb. Everyone had until March to pay their $375 share. \n\nThis week I sent the rest of the budget, $250 due by Aug 1.\n\nThen I got a text from a girl we’ll call A:\n\n“Hey it’s A! I didn’t realize we were going to have to send more money on top of the $375 we sent. I just moved into my first apartment and I have no money to give at the moment or in the next couple of months. I definitely cannot afford it right now. Do you want to just give me the $375 back? Or is there something we can do for me to still go? Lmk thx.”\n\nI replied, “I’ll send you your money back.” She said:“Okay! Thx.”\n\nI refunded her, reran the numbers, and updated the group.\n\nThe next day, I got a text from girl B saying she and A now want to come just for Saturday. A bit frustrating, but I said okay and adjusted the budget again.\n\nLater that night, another bridesmaid told me girl C had contacted her to ask me to give A an extension. I’ve never met A, B, or C, and I was confused. So I texted A:\n\n“Hey, I’m honestly confused. You mentioned you couldn’t pay and wanted your $375 back, then B said you’re both coming just for Saturday, and now D is asking C about an extension for you. I totally understand things can change, but each time they do, I have to redo all the numbers, which is a lot to manage. Can you let me know your final decision so I can plan accordingly?”\n\nA: “I didn’t say I wanted my $375 back, i asked if you wanted to give that to me or if there was something we can do for me to still go. Because I want to be there for BRIDE. I didn’t ask B to ask you for me she just did it and so did D. They just want me to go. I will do what D and C are saying…thx.”\n\nMe: “You said ‘i have no money to give at the moment or in the next couple of months. I definitely cannot afford it right now. Do you want to just give me the $300 back.’ That sounds like a beat around the bush way of asking for your money back to me.\n\nI don’t care who asked who, all I care about is your final decision. You didn’t ask me for an extension. You did not come to me with a plan ‘hey, money is tight for me. Would I be able to send you half of my remaining balance on August 1st and the other half August 15th?’ Not ‘I definitely cannot afford it now or in the next couple of months.’ I’m not a bank. I don’t know you. I’m not in charge of your finances.”\n\nA: “‘Or is there something we can do for me to still go? Lmk thx’ Did you not read this? Not beating around the bush at all but god why are you being so rude..you could have given everyone a heads up that the price could change or have some kind of budget..i understand this is stressful for you, but you don’t need to be rude to people especially people you don’t know. I’m good actually. I just won’t go. Hope it’s easier for you lol. When BRIDE asks why I’m not going anymore, I’ll be sure to let her know.”\n\nMe: “You’re not going because you can’t afford it.”",

Correct?\"\n\nBut for any situation that is delicate or awkward, such as asking for a special favor, text messages are not ideal because you can't discern tone from a text, and it can inflame an already tense situation.\n\nI would particularly like to know what led A to get this idea into her head:\n\n*\"I didn’t realize we were going to have to send more money on top of the $375 we sent.\"*\n\nWhy not?

      "scenario_description": "So for context, I'm 16f, and he is 46m. I have a long name, for example, Anastasia, but I hate my name. I can acknowledge that it holds importance to my parents, so around relatives and guests, I let them introduce me as Anastasia, and the odd slip doesn't really matter that much. \nBut my dad is adamant that Anastasia is my name, and I should be addressed as such even when I've made it known that I dont like it. \nFor context, I ask them to call me Ana, and I introduce myself to new people as Ana. If you call me Anastasia, I might not respond simply because it doesn't register in my head. I've explained to both of my parents a thousand times why I prefer Ana. It's shorter, easier to say, and it feels more like me. \nWhen I was younger, say ages 5 to 13, I went primarily by Anastasia. However, at that time, I was also extremely anxious and in a very bad mental state. (I'm a lot better now, with therapy and medication, and I've managed to control my anxiety). \nBut being called Anastasia reminds me of that time of my life, which only adds to my dislike of the name. The name brings back lots of old feelings, and it just doesn't fit me anymore and hasn't for years. \nSometimes, my dad will call me Anastasia intentionally to make me upset. When we're at the dinner table, for example, he'll say things like \"please pass the salt Anastasia\" while giving me a look that makes me feel like he's trying to prove a point. The point he's trying to prove is that my legal name is Anastasia, and he doesn't have to call me anything else. \nEvery time he's done that, I've either redirected or just said \"Ana, dad\" while passing what he wants. \nHere's where i might be the jerk. Tonight, I was fed up. So I responded with \"Sure, George\" and passed him whatever he'd asked for. \nHe flipped out. He got very upset because I was being disrespectful, and I should never call him that again. I kept going and called him George (his legal name) a couple more times during that night. Additionally, he is adamant that \"Anastasia isn't your dead name, so i will continue to call you the name that i gave you.\" \nNow, my mom and him are saying I'm the jerk.  So Reddit, thoughts?\n\nEdit to add. My mom and dad do both call me primarily call me Ana. It's just that my dad and I have had this argument many times before, with me saying that Ana is what I prefer and he should respect that and him saying that it's not the name he gave me. My mom is of a similar opinion to him. However, she is less argumentative about it, and there are less conflicts. Whenever my dad and I fight about this, she always backs him. Additionally, I've made it known that I would be fine if he would rather call me Anya, Asia, Stacia, Annie, Stacy, literally any other variation or nickname for Anastasia or even my middle name. I understand that maybe his issue is with the name I've chosen, Ana, so I've offered him alternatives that don't force him to call me by a name he doesn't like and that doesn't force me to hear my full name. \nAs to the comments suggesting I legally change my name once I'm of age, I have considered it. At this point in time, I don't know what my actions going forward will be because the only person (people) who make a fuss about Ana are my dad and sometimes mom. I have also told my dad that I'm considering changing my name. Whenever I've said this, my entire family (dad, mom, brother) have basically called it stupid and said that I was being childish. \nTo those saying that this is how kids end up cutting off their parents, I dont see myself ever actually doing that. Despite this blip and the conflict, my dad is a generally amazing man who tries his hardest with what he's been given. I love him very much, and he's given me an amazing childhood. I'm just really getting frustrated with having to hear a name that I dont like nearly on the daily. \nI've expressed my opinion to him, and every time, it has gone over similarly. We've been having this argument at least weekly for at least a couple of years. \nI also did not claim to be trans. I am not transgender. I only made the comment of him likening Anastasia to being a dead name because he says it frequently. I am not trying to claim the struggles of the LGBTQ community or trans people. I hold immense respect for their struggles and successes, and i would never want to invalidate them by comparing our experiences. I only said that because my dad has made the comment multiple times, essentially trying to make the point to me that if I were transitioning then he would respect my name choice, but because it is just a preference of mine, it doesnt hold the same weight to him.\nThank you, everyone, for all the support and kindness in the comments, I greatly appreciate it. I hope you all have an amazing day!",

Parents choose names for tiny babies, not for the people they grow into. Sometimes a name just doesn't fit.\n\nIf parents love the name so much and feel hurt that their child rejected it, they should give it to a dog or a cat.\n\nAssuming the legal adult age in your country is 18, you are less than two years away from being able to legally change your name to anything you want, and he won't be able to do a damn thing about it. Hang in there. The time will pass quickly.\n\nIn the meantime, you're doing nothing wrong. You can call him George every time he calls you Anastasia, or you can ignore him.\n\nAnd work towards moving out of there as soon as you can.",

      "scenario_description": "So I posted here a few years back regarding a situation with my MIL. Long story short, we put my dog down and my MIL called me a cry baby because I was upset just an hour after it happened.\n\nFast forward a few years. Yesterday, my in laws had to put their dog down. I know the pain of it and it sucks. That being said, they are acting like nobody else has ever lost a pet before. Non stop crying, dramatizing the events, calling everybody they can to tell them what happened and crying to them, saying they’ll never be the same, they’ll never recover, life has ended, this situation is different.\n\nI’ll always be supportive of my wife. I feel for her. She also felt for me when Input my dog down and defended me when her mother called me a cry baby. But, my MIL called today to cry and vent more about the situation. I couldn’t help but quickly stare at the ceiling and roll my eyes due to what she had said to me and the glaring hypocrisy. Don’t get me wrong, I’m bummed about what happened. Their dog was a part of my life for nearly a decade. But I couldn’t hold it in.\n\nMy wife told my MIL she had to go, hung up, and snapped at me for rolling my eyes. I responded with “I’m sorry. I understand and get why you’re upset. But this isn’t even to the level of how I acted yet I was ridiculed.”\n\nShe said not the time or place. I agree, but I internally cannot help but find her families reaction overly dramatic. AITA? ",

Of course most people don't get as upset over the death of other people's pets as they do over their own! Me, I have a weakness for those vet shows on TV. I keep a box of tissues nearby, and I shed a tear or two when the animal doesn't make it. That's nothing remotely like how I feel when I lose my own pet. It's devastating.\n\nNor would your question be \"AITA for feeling that my MIL is a hypocrite\". Because (a) you can't help your feelings, and (b) you're right, she is a hypocrite.\n\nYour real question is \"AITA for not *hiding my irritation* in front of my wife regarding my MIL's hypocrisy.\" Because yes, you are, a bit. Your wife has a point. She's trying to comfort her mother at a painful time, and you're rolling your eyes. Walk out of the room if it irritates you so much.\n\nI don't think you'd be wrong for discussing this with your wife at some later date, especially if your MIL continues to criticize you for something she does herself. But right now is not the time.\n\nUPDATED to add: I wonder if your MIL is displaying a bit of gender bias here. You didn't state your gender, but I'm guessing you're male. I wonder if the real reason MIL called you a crybaby is because she has bought into the ridiculous notion that \"Men don't cry\", whereas she has given herself permission to cry whenever she wants because she's female.",

      "post_title": "AITA for asking my roommate to pay more for utilities after his boyfriend basically started living with us?",
      "scenario_description": "I (28F) live in Arizona with my partner Lena (we share a bedroom) and our roommate Chris (30M). Until recently, we split rent and utilities evenly — three ways.\n\nBut here’s the situation: Lena and I haven’t changed our habits at all, yet our SRP electric bill jumped by over $100. I’ve also been covering two-thirds of the rent and utilities since Lena lost her job — I’ve been paying more without complaint — but the sudden spike in power use didn’t add up.\n\nWhat did change:\n\t•\tChris brought in a 3D printer setup and additional fans\n\t•\tHis boyfriend (we’ll call him Dylan) has been staying over 4–5 days a week, consistently\n\t•\tLena and I were out of town for several days — Chris and Dylan were the only ones home — and usage still racked up $72 just that week\n\nSo I brought it up — calmly. I said it seemed fair to revisit the utility split since Chris’s usage and Dylan’s regular presence were new variables.\n\nChris got defensive fast:\n\n“My printers are unplugged or only used at night. I always turn off lights you guys leave on. Dylan doesn’t really use anything.”\n\nThen came the thermostat thing: Chris said he had set it to 78 degrees before leaving for a few days — calling it a test to prove that Lena and I were running the AC too much.\n\nBut here’s the thing: we had no idea there was an “experiment,” and were adjusting it back down to 74 because the house was muggy and uncomfortable. His test didn’t prove anything.\n\nAnd even with that — after Chris and Dylan left for just 3–4 days, the projected SRP bill dropped by $40, even though Lena and I were still using TV, lights, gaming, and AC like normal.\n\nWhen Lena tried to speak during all this, Chris said:\n\n“I’m not talking to you. I want to speak to the person who pays the bills.”\nWhich is… me.\n\nLater, Chris’s mom messaged me directly and said:\n\n“It’s supposed to be three ways and Lena’s not even on the lease. You’re trying to make Chris pay 50/50? You guys should just move out. You’re not real friends.”\n\nIt felt like they were trying to invalidate Lena’s presence entirely — despite the fact that she and I share a room, and I’ve fully covered her share while she’s unemployed.\n\nAll of this — because I asked for a more fair split, when:\n\t•\tChris added new, power-drawing equipment\n\t•\tHis boyfriend is practically living here\n\t•\tI already pay more than anyone else\n\t•\tAnd the actual usage data supports what I’m saying\n\nAITA for asking him to contribute more to utilities when the increased cost is clearly tied to his side of the house?\n\n\nUpdate: He Changed the SRP Password After Being Proven Wrong 💅\n\nSo, we found out we were on a basic flat-rate plan this whole time — no off-peak hours, no peak penalties. Just pure, uncut electricity usage. Meaning… the bill changes based on actual consumption, not when you run things.\n\nWe started tracking our projected usage, and lo and behold — the daily projection kept dropping after my partner and I brought up our concerns. Chris could no longer gaslight us with “I’m barely here” and “It’s not me.” The SRP numbers spoke for themselves.\n\nHis response? \nHe changed the SRP account password. 🙃\n\nAt that point, it was clear — conversation wasn’t working, facts didn’t matter, and compromise wasn’t coming. So we made moves:\n\t•\tLena (my partner) is officially being added to the lease\n\t•\tChris is moving out (he didn’t give us a date, but the boxes are real) He insisted that 50/50 is unfair to him. \n\t•\tWe’re just waiting on the final logistics to finalize the transfer and I have already got a new SRP account in my name. \n\nHonestly, it’s a relief. There’s no room in my life for people who treat fairness like an insult and facts like an attack. Sometimes peace is just one lease amendment away.\n\nThanks for the feedback, laughs, and spicy takes. \nYou were right, he HAS to go. ",

To emphasize the fairness of what you're asking for, you should be more focused on the figures showing the actual increased power usage, especially at times when you and Lena were away, and less on the dollar cost, the increase of which could be due to other things.\n\nWhere I live, power bills (and other bills) are itemized to the nth degree. You can see exact amounts of peak usage, off-peak usage, and so on. Of course different power companies (or different regions, or different countries) will have different ways of presenting their bills, but the same basic info should be there somewhere. Dig out a year or so's bills, and study this usage info carefully. See if it backs up your assertion that the increased power bill was mainly or completely due to whatever Chris has been doing recently, and not merely due to increased unit cost or whatever. That will give you more of a leg to stand on.\n\n2. I was about to ask \"Dylan has turned into a fourth resident of this house. Did you and Lena ever agree to this?\" But then I noticed you said \"*Lena’s not even on the lease*\". So if you plan to confront Chris about the fact that he has effectively introduced a fourth roommate by stealth, keep in mind that you yourself may have created the precedent by bringing Lena in.\n\nGranted, you stepped up immediately and ensured that Lena paid her fare share (or you covered her if she couldn't). But sharing a house involves more than money. There's living space and privacy considerations too. I've found when sharing houses, the money issue is often the least of my worries. I just want to have some living space to myself without always having another person there. I want to go to the bathroom without having it occupied by someone else. I want to take the time to wash my hair without someone banging on the door asking how much longer I will be. I want to make myself a sandwich without someone else being in the kitchen cooking a meal. I want to watch TV in the living room without someone already watching a different program.\n\nThe more people you cram into a house, the more likely it is that these minor irritations will occur - and over time, minor irritations can add up to major conflicts. Basically, introducing a new person to the house should not happen without the agreement of everyone already there. Having a boyfriend or girlfriend stay over for several nights a week is near as dammit to having an extra roommate. But be careful about using that argument with Chris. He may turn around and say \"But that's what you did with Lena.\"",

But constantly they are hosting events and inviting my kids but NEVER me, they always tell my baby daddy specifically to not invite me and make sure that he can get the kids the day of the parties/events so that way I don't even have to know about them, well they got away with that before this time, after picking my kids up from their dads, my daughter was squealing all about the party to me and how excited she was to go, of course I was excited for her that was until I contacted the cousins mom and she told me that I was NOT invited due to that side of the family not wanting any awkwardness. How would it be awkward? Unless they make it awkward? I for a certain would NEVER bring any drama upon a child's event! That's my children's family whether I am with their dad or not. I want to let them go but I want to experience it with them... Would I be the asshole if I held them back from this one?

      "scenario_description": "We live in Australia where we have “op shops” which are effectively thrift stores run for charities by volunteers, mainly retired older women. (I don’t know if it’s the same elsewhere in the world, but I’m trying to paint the picture). They vary in quality - some are very well organised and clean, some a very junky with soiled goods and bits of rubbish. \n\nI visited an op shop I hadn’t been to before on the weekend with my 6 year old, and my friend and her 6 year old. The kids were checking out the toy section, which were a few sparse shelves with mostly plastic baby toys, and some buckets with smaller bits thrown in them. They were looking around and picking things up to look at them while I was browsing. My friend’s son pressed some buttons on a toy and it sent off sounds and flashing lights on the toy. That’s when a woman who worked there came over and was really quite unpleasant - she said “Don’t let the children play with the toys. They aren’t for playing.” I was surprised and didn’t know what to say - I mean, you can press the buttons on toys in Target, and the kids weren’t being rough or anything. She seemed annoyed at my dumbfounded silence and gruffly said “They’re for sale, stop them playing”.\n\nI think I frowned before turning away and ignoring her, as my instinct was to disagree but didn’t want to be rude with the kids there (so I was rude in a quieter way). \n\nIs this a thing? AITA? I know it’s a small thing but I’m surprised by her insistence that it was the wrong thing to do, and felt bad for the kids when I’d said it was ok to touch the toys.",

Toy stores don't want you treating them as convenient playgrounds while you shop. They don't want your kids ripping open packages to try everything out. (They often have demonstration models on display for precisely that reason.) If you buy something from a toy store, you can take it for granted that the toy does work as promised, and if it doesn't, then at least you have some recourse - you can return the toy for a refund or replacement.\n\nBut this isn't a toy store. It's an op shop, and different rules apply. The toys are all second hand. They might not work properly. They might not work at all! The innards might be broken, or there might be a vital piece missing. If you buy a second hand toy without trying it out, and you take it home and discover it doesn't work, I very much doubt the op shop would give you your money back.\n\nFor that reason, it is perfectly reasonable to try out a second hand toy - or more importantly, let your kids try it out - before deciding whether to buy it. And for some toys, \"trying it out\" means it's going to make a racket.\n\nAll you were required to do was make sure the kids didn't get in anyone else's way, didn't leave the toy area messy, and didn't damage the toys. As long as you did that, you were being a responsible parent and you were not the asshole. The woman was unreasonable.\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of op shops around. Avoid that one and shop at another.",

I had to go to tribunals to find out what was even wrong with her (she removed all next of kin at the hospital) and even then she said she didn't want me involved due to my disability (autism) and to let the government handle her (I got medical guardianship).\n\nOriginally the plan was to move her to a nursing home near me (30 mins) however her Dementia causes paranoia and she won't let the orderlies touch her. The doctors don't want to sedate her for 4hrs to move her and have asked to move her locally. I agreed not wanting to distress my auntie.\n\nNow the person who can deside where she lives (government lady, well call her A) has asked me to regularly visit her. However she no longer remembers me or even my father and just tells us to go away. I told A after this month visit I will no longer see her as she doesn't remember me and it's hard to travel 4 hrs with my mental health and physical (I also have pots and gastroparesis) to be told to go away and travel 4 hrs back.\n\nShe seemed really angry at this and told me it's just the disease talking and I need to visit her for he benefits but I rebutted with what benefits? She doesn't know me anymore? I'm just a random stranger harassing her now. She rebutted with the fact I wanted her moved near me and I told her a 4 hr trip is different to 30mins.\n\nMy mum, who was listening, said she seemed really mad during the conversation so I know it's not me overthinking.\n\nI believe I might be the asshole because I'm not visiting my auntie in her last moments. So Reddit AITA for not visiting my dying great aunt?\n\nEdit: I should mention my auntie is blind and paranoid and at the end stages of dementia. She cannot recognise anyone and is extremely suspicious of all people including family, medical staff and friends. I've been told while they can't give a timeline like with cancer it could be tonight or months before she passed (I will note the doctor said months not years)",

      "comment_text": "I believe A is wrong - and that's without even taking into account the many factors that make it difficult for you to visit, such as the distance and your health problems. Allow me to explain.\n\nI work in supported aged/disability care. As far as possible, we allow our residents to make choices about how they want to spend their lives.\n\nWe may not agree with every decision they make. We know in many cases what they're choosing is not in their best interests. For example, several of our residents smoke, despite having emphysema and even lung cancer. We also have a resident with chronic kidney disease, likely to be terminal, who refuses the healthy cooked meals we provide and insists on ordering takeout pizzas and KFC almost every day. It's high in salt and fat, and not what he should be eating.\n\nWe explain to them the consequences of their decisions, we explain that these choices are shortening their lives *but we don't stop them*. It's their life, not ours, and they know what will make them happy.\n\nI'm not going to dictate to someone how they can spend their few remaining days. On the contrary, I will support their choice as much as possible. All we ask is that their choices don't involve us in any illegal activity and don't disturb their fellow residents. Within those parameters, they can pretty much choose what they want.\n\nAnd thus it is for your great-aunt.\n\nThe government lady A may well believe it's in your great-aunt's best interests to have you visit, but **your great-aunt is saying otherwise**. She's telling you to go away. She is visibly distressed and/or annoyed by your presence. **And her wishes, even if they originate from dementia, must be respected.**\n\nI am so sorry she no longer recognizes you. The person she was is no longer there, so what you're experiencing is a kind of grief. Honor the person she was, thank the universe that gave her to you, remember the good times you had together, mourn her absence from your life, but above all, respect her wishes.\n\nNTA. I wish you both well.",

      "scenario_description": "Some context: my friend had been looking for a job for a long time after college, and my dad needed help at the office he runs so he decided to bring this friend on. I warned him before he offered my friend the job that this would probably not be the smartest decision because friends and business don’t mix, but he went forward with it anyway.\n\nFast forward a couple years, I noticed my friend had been taking a lot of days off. Coming up to this point there has been growing tension as my dad felt this friend doesn’t care about the business, snaps at people when he’s corrected, and is gone a lot. My dad had been deciding on whether to fire this person or not, and has been pretty stressed about it for a while. I finally decided to ask my friend where he had been going. He told me that he really didn’t want me to find out, but he had gotten another job and was afraid I would tell my dad immediately and things would be awkward.\n\nHe asked that I promise not to tell my dad. I said okay, sure. I don’t want to mix personal life with work, so I would try to view this objectively as if we weren’t friends. And so I did. Honestly I had a bit of a mental breakdown over it, but I was able to calm myself down and agree not to say anything.\n\n30 days later my friend submits his two week notice. I get a text from my dad asking if I knew and I thought he’d be happy, so I said yes, and that I found out on accident a month ago. He asks a couple questions and he seemed chill about it.\n\nMy dad calls my friend to talk about it and approve the resignation, and then comes into the office. My friend makes the announcement and everything is fine and work is as usual until the very end of the day at home.\n\nI walked through the door and my dad told me that I betrayed him, that I knew this whole time that my friend was going to leave and I didn’t tell him, and that he doesn’t want me coming in to the office anymore because he doesn’t want a back stabber around. He said I put my friend before my family, and that I let him struggle all this time knowing that my friend would be leaving soon anyway. He said anybody else would have told their family if they were in my position, but that I actively made the decision to withhold the information from him to protect my friend and not my dad’s business.\n\nI said I 1. Didn’t know when my friend would be resigning 2. didn’t want work and home to mix and 3. Didn’t think it would be a betrayal at all as I thought he would just be glad it’s done with and move on. Objectively, both my dad and I wouldn’t have known anything if this person wasn’t my friend in the first place. \n \nMy dad is extremely upset (we ended up having a yelling match) and my grandfather agrees that I should have told him because family and our business is more important than a friend, but I don’t see what the downside is and what I needed to “protect” the business from. I really just need a neutral opinion. \n\nAITA?\n",

It didn't end well. Little things you can ignore or brush aside or laugh at when you're just visiting each other become magnified when you have to spend 8 hours a day together.\n\nFortunately, we chose not to take it personally and we managed to repair our relationship and stay on speaking terms. But I learned from the experience. I'll never work for family again.\n\nNTA. Find another job.",

As soon as we got there I opened the door and it was extremely windy that day, so as I let go of the door accidentally the door bumped the car beside us (not leaving a scratch a dent a paint smudge, nothing) but she freaked out on me! She started saying that I needed to be more careful and that she couldn’t believe I did that, she made the dad move the car and she started telling the family to not walk with me as she was walking fast up ahead of me and trying to drag everyone else to do the same. Then, inside she kept asking “do you even know how to skate?” In such a weird condescending way, then everytime we came to sit at the table she’d ask while laughing if I had fallen down yet. (She did not ask this to anyone else, including her younger son’s girlfriend). And ever since then she has made snarky comments and talked about me right in front of me and I’m honestly so tired of it.\n\nShe has made me not want to go around anymore from how uncomfortable and bad she makes me feel. My boyfriend insists that she “Loves me” but I can not even be around her anymore without practically feeling the tension and uncomfortabeness in the air and I feel bad because my boyfriend just wants us to get along so I don’t know if I am being dramatic and a jerk or if this is a valid boundary for me.\n\nAITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My mom recently got a margarita machine, which is cool! But I don't drink, so if i ask for a virgon one, she adds in the alcohol after, which she's done quite a few times. I asked for one virgin one tonight since I'd been having a bad day and like bled through my pants at school which kinda sucked. Anyways, I was having a bad day. I finished about half the drink, before I overheard her talking about the alcohol she mixed in while blending it. I stopped drinking my drink and went over to make sure I heard her correct. She said it was a mild alcohol and said not to make a fuss about it. I was honestly quite upset and trying to hold back tears. I had always made it very clear that I didn't want to smoke or drink until I felt ready. And she's done this behind my back when I left the room. I feel betrayed and honestly mad that I was fed alcohol against my own preference and as respectfully as I could, turned down the drink and gave it to my sister to finish and left. As I said, I've been having a bad day and this is a bit of a tipping point for me. So I do impact have a few frustration tears and have requested alone time to think. Am I the ashore?",

      "comment_text": "Lifelong non-drinker here.\n\nPutting alcohol in the drink of any person who has explicitly asked for no alcohol is an immoral thing to do, and (depending on the jurisdiction and your age) possibly an illegal thing to do.\n\nYou never need to justify why you're not drinking on one particular day, or why you're not drinking for the foreseeable future, or even why you're not drinking for the rest of your life. It's no one's business but yours. Never forget that, because there will be times in future when people try to pressure you or at least demand to know why you're not drinking.\n\nNor do you need to apologize for your reaction. I'd be very upset too if I discovered my drinks were being spiked by someone I thought I could trust.\n\nYou cannot trust your mother. From now on, make your own drinks.\n\nNTA.\n\nPS. You mentioned not smoking until you're \"ready\". It's not a question of being ready; smoking is not a sign of maturity. I watched one parent die a terrible death from smoking-related illness. The easiest way to quit smoking is never to start.",

      "scenario_description": "We have a toddler, a two year old girl.\n\nRecently her hair has gotten so long that it's getting tangled at night. I don't mind brushing it out in the morning, but she's an active kid and it's also getting in her face and annoying her while playing. I tried cutting bangs, but it didn't help much. It's pretty much always in pig tails at this point.\n\nI told my husband I was going to just cut it short because I'm getting sick of dealing with it. He said I can't do that because it would look weird. I told him I don't see the issue because it's not like her or the other toddlers would notice. He said I was just lazy, and the day care workers would think so too if I cut it. I told him I don't care what they think of me, and he can brush it and put it up every morning if he wants. He said he doesn't have time. \n\nOur daughter is always bathed, has clean clothes, and brushed teeth. I wake up early enough to feed her breakfast every day. Honestly, I don't know why I can't just be a bit lazy with this one thing. Half the parents don't have to worry about doing their son's hair in the morning, why should I? It just seems sexist to me. \n\nEdit to add: By shaving, I mean into a boy's cut with a trimmer. Yes, I'd take her to a hair dresser to get it done. I'm thinking something like faded on the sides and a little longer on the top, not just a one guard across the whole thing.\n\nOur daughter could not care in the least about her hair or her style. She's really a roll in the mud first chance she gets kinda kid. \n\nAlso, a lot of people are pointing out that feeding and clothing her are the bare minimum. I know that. I was trying to argue that the day care workers shouldn't think I'm lazy or neglectful just because she showed up with no hair all of a sudden. I do plenty with my daughter, I'm just not a morning person. \n\nMy husband is perfectly capable of waking up 10 minutes earlier if he wanted to do it, but he's the kind of guy to hit snooze 'without realizing it' 5 times and constantly be running late. \n\nSomeone clarified it should be: Would I be the asshole?\n\n\n\n",

Are you genuinely talking about SHAVING it, as opposed to simply cutting her hair in a shorter style? There is a vast range of lengths between \"long enough to put in pigtails\" and \"shaved off completely\".\n2. Have you done the deed already, or are you just thinking about doing it? If you haven't done it yet, you should have made that clear by asking WIBTA.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThe edit to your original post answers the above questions:\n\n1. You're talking about cutting it short like a boy's, not shaving it bald, and you'd be taking her to a hairdresser to have it done professionally.\n\n2. You haven't done it yet.\n\nSo my verdict is NTA.",
