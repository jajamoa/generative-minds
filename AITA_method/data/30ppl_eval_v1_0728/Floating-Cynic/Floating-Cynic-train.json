      "scenario_description": "This is such a stupid thing to even talk about but whatever.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend \"Dan\" (M27) and I (F25) both work full time. Dan and his friends (4 guys, all late 20s) all work from home, and they like to meet up and hang out when they work. Great! Happy for them! They'll rotate between their houses, meeting up for lunch and kind of extending that into a post-work hangout.\n\nThe thing is, all of his friends live alone. Dan & I live together. One of my biggest pet peeves is having random people in my house when I get home from work. I hate it so much-- I just wanna take my shoes off and relax and I can't do that if there's four dudes that I don't really know in my living room and kitchen.\n\nI spoke to Dan about potentially removing our house from the rotation, or at least taking his friends out around the time I get home. He said that was controlling, which maybe it is. He also said it wouldn't be fair for them to host every week and for him to just skate by.\n\nI get that! I do! But I feel like I'm a variable that isn't being accounted for here. Honestly I'm conflicted here, so I figured I'd ask: am I an asshole for not wanting my boyfriend's friends over when I get home?\n\nEDIT for more info, from a couple questions (& comments) I've seen:\n\n- The guys come over once a week usually. Sometimes twice a week. They come over at lunchtime (noon ish), and they're there until usually 7PM or so. I get home at 5:30 ish.\n\n- I do not want or expect my bf to stop hanging out with his friends, nor am I expecting him to break up with me for this. I didn't lecture or yell at him or anything, we had a regular conversation about this.\n\n- The guys themselves are not creepy or weird or anything. I'm just tired after work and I like being able to unwind, and part of that (for me at least) is the comfort of knowing I don't have guests around.\n\n- I can't avoid them that much-- our apartment is an open floor plan & the only bathroom is in our bedroom, so there's always *some* level of interaction.",

Had he not said this I would probably vote n-a-h. \n\n\nHanging out from noon-7 every day is actually the equivalent of a full-time job. I think most places need a minimum of 32 hours to receive benefits,  these guys are hanging out 35. \n\n\nBasically once a week, OP's home isn't her own. There's no place to go. And her boyfriend is calling her *controlling* because he doesn't want to cut all of 2 hours off his excessive visiting time, or IDK, just go to a coffee shop? That's manipulative.  ",

      "scenario_description": "Hey guys, so, I had a weird grievance about me. My third cousin, who's the same age as me, came to me and said that I owed her some money. I was shocked because I've never borrowed from her ever! So, it turns out that our aunt has taken her jewelry shopping and has asked her to pick out a necklace for me. She has jokingly asked the aunt if she was getting anything at all to which the aunt said \"No\". So, she chose an ugly necklace. Two weeks later, my aunt came to me and asked me to pick a necklace out for her which I thought would suit her. I picked a cute necklace with a small pink diamond pendant.\n\nAnd for Easter we gather in our grandparents house to celebrate the day. The aunt asked us to wrap the presents. We had already done so. Then when it was time for gift giving, she simply asked us to open the box we had wrapped by ourselves (which we thought was the other person's). Or if we wanted we could gift it to each other. I was so happy to get the cute necklace which I selected. But, my cousin wasn't. She simply demanded that I give her \"her rightful\" present (the cute necklace) and take the meh necklace. I refused and said that we were supposed to keep our own gifts because we spent time selecting it and aunt didn't wanna take risk and so she took us shopping and still made it a lovely surprise. And so, she's stuck with the ugly necklace and not me. But she argued and said that she doesn't find it ugly but wants to encourage gifting between \"family\". She wants me to be stuck with the ugly one and my other relatives who don't understand have sided with her. \n\n\nPlease help me. I'll quote your replies to my relatives. And if it's like above 50% supporting me, I'll have a solid point to hold onto. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (46 F) has never had a good relationship with my mother. Recently, my mother has been playing the sad song because she was unhappy where she was living and literally told me every lie she could in order to move into my house. Some examples are \"I am being kicked out\", I am going to have to live in my car\", \"They are mean to me and abuse me\" and so on. Knowing my mother’s history, I went against my better judgment and allowed her to move in with me and my son (25M), knowing she was going to disrupt my home. But at the end of the day, she is mom and I cannot allow her to be homeless. Now lets fast forward to present day, my mother has had a history of medication (pill popper) abuse. She also plays victim and martyr a lot. She talks bad things about every single person around her and no one or nothing is ever good enough. She is known to lie to get her way and makes up horrible stories about people to get pity from anyone and anything that will listen. With that being said, I got a call from a paramedic this past weekend advising me that my mother was found passed out for 2 hours in her car in the parking lot of a gas station. I, of course, went to go get her. When I got to the gas station I got her in my car, while my son took her car home, and I went into the gas station to purchase a drink. The cashier at the gas station, not knowing who I was, started telling me how she felt bad for the woman in the parking lot, she is having issues with the people she lives with, they are kicking her out and she will have no where to go. To my knowledge, there are no issues in our home since April, which is when she moved in, there has not been one single argument, raising of voice or harsh word said. Everything has been just dandy, yet she is making up lies to total strangers just for sympathy. My fear is she is going to run her mouth to the wrong person and I ultimately will be thrown in jail for elder abuse based on lies. She lives in a stable environment, she has food, clothes, a damn Iphone an Ipad, and everything she needs to keep her entertained a television, 2 cats that love her and A/C in this miserable Florida weather and a car to come and go as she pleases. My homes harmony is completely screwed because of her constant negativity and need for attention. She is starting to affect both my and my sons mental health and I am at an utter loss of what to do. So would I be the asshole for asking my mother to leave since she is telling everyone we are kicking her out and making her homeless anyway?",

      "scenario_description": "My husband had been sick for a long time. I was his carer and was able to work from home to be there when he needed me. When we went to hospital I was his advocate.  His children would call or stop by just to ask for money. I even gave up a works bonus to give it all to his daughter. We took £1000 out of our limited savings to help the other with the understanding she would pay it back. We did not expect massive payments, just like £20 a month. \nMy husband finally realised what they were doing and stopped giving them money. This was about 2 years before he passed. The girls stopped calling or coming by at all once the bank dried up. \nI could see how badly it affected him, at times he would just stare off into space and say he missed them.  Both girls had changed their phone numbers and had moved from their home so we had no way to get in touch.our numbers were the same. The landline was about ten years old and the mobiles about 8 years. So they could have called anytime or stopped by as we had been at that address for 14 years. \nMy passed at the end of December. It was really unexpected as he was doing ok. I was absolutely hysterical about his death. And then I found out the corner may wish to do an autopsy as it was unexpected. \nThe time of year made a backlog of cases for the coroner, so we had to wait. \nIt took me a week to even think of notifying his daughters. I realise I should have tried to reach out earlier, but I was not doing well with the loss. \nI remembered one of the daughters having a Facebook account so I looked through and found her. I sent her the message ‘please call, urgent’\nI got a call almost immediately and told her what had happened. About 20 minutes later there was frantic knocking on the door. The younger of his girls was out there spitting fire it took me a week to tell them. She asked when the funeral was being held and we told her we didn’t know but would be  telling them the minute we found out. She accused me of lying about it and that I wouldn’t let them know when their own father’s funeral real would be. \n\nA few days later I started get text messages with ‘I want this item or that one’ it was becoming ridiculous. I rounded up everything that had been theirs and gave it to them. Plus more from the texts the asked for.\nIt was funny after 2 years of silence suddenly they wanted rings of his. \nI was finally able to arrange his funeral and a few days later his ashes were delivered to me. The final text I got from them was can we have some of his ashes for remembrance jewelry. \nI said No. I told them my husband had never even wanted me to notify them he had died…so I was going to give them any of his ashes…\nAITA for not giving them some of his ashes?\n\nEdited:\nI get that a lot of you are condemning me for the late notification of their father’s death. I understand where you’re coming from. What you have to understand is I got up to use the toilet at 3am went back to bed next to him and then woke up at 4;05 am and he was gone!. He had a DNR in place so I couldn’t even try to give him CPR. The doctor was called and I sat downstairs waiting for the results of the exam to verify his death and I honestly thought the doctor was going to say I have arranged ambulance to rush him to hospital. Instead he said his condolences. Called the police to stand guard over our bedroom u til the corner got there hours later.  \nI was in such shock I sat in his favourite chair, for days,barely ate,and just stared at nothing.  It took a week for my brain to even comprehend he was gone. Kept thinking he was just at hospital. I have learned since that the trauma of waking up next to him kind of shut my bat in down to try and protect me from the pain. \nSo I agree they should have been to,d right away, but I was in no state to think rationally and as soon as my brain stated working I tried to find a way to contact them.

It was not his wish to be turned into jewelry.  NTA\n\n\nI'm guessing OP is not a part of these cultures, but many cultures that honor the dead do not allow separation of ashes in the event of cremation,  because all the ashes are still the body of the person and not meant to be casually distributed for the personal convenience of others.  I find it disturbing that people think you should just hand some of the ashes over- his kids have already taken *enough* of him, he didn't want them to have more. Call me superstitious or sentimental but I think that *matters.* And frankly,  you don't need ashes for remembrance jewelry,  anything you purchase to remember a loved one fulfills that purpose.  \n\n\nI'm someone with toxic family and estranged from some. Cutting contact means accepting you might not inherit, even if the person deserves to be cut out. The daughters need to own their choices. ",

      "scenario_description": "I had a friend come visit from out of town for a long weekend. We've been friend over 20 years,  and I was excited to see her.\n\nShe's had cats in the past, but married someone who is highly allergic to almost anything with fur, so she hasn't had any furred pets in many years (she has some reptiles). I have nurmerous cats, and she was also excited to get a weekend of kitties.\n\nHowever, it became clear very quickly that she doesn't live with cats. Leaving food unattended, putting cups on the edge of the coffee table/counter, etc, made it a very messy weekend. But whatever, right?\n\nThen there was the dental floss.\n\nFor context here, one of my cats ate a string he pulled out of a rug several months ago, and I paid THOUSANDS to save him. Like, he should have died - not only was it a very long string, but he had numerous post-op complications. But he is my baby, and it was money well spent to me. My cat learned exactly nothing from the experience - he still LOVES string and hair ties, and I am hypervigilant about such things being left out where he can access them.\n\nI told my friend she CANNOT throw dental floss in the bathroom trash - it has to go in the kitchen trash. The bathroom trash had a lid, but this cat is very smart and very determined. And in the event the lid doesn't get closed, it's essentially leaving string right at cat-height.\n\nWell, she didn't get the (very direct, not even a hint) hint. I kept finding floss in the bathroom trash, and twice I found it just laying on the counter, waiting to be swallowed. The first couple times, I tried to gently remind her. Then I directly told her again. When I found floss, yet again, just laying on the counter, I told her she needed to hand over her floss. I have the little floss picks she can use, but I cannot have long strings just being left around the house willy nilly. I cannot afford to have another major emergency vet surgery. I was not rude about it, and I did not yell or anything, but it was just too big a risk to keep allowing her to leave it lying about. \n\nShe complied, but after she went home her husband called me and said I was being totally put of line and treating her like a child, and that I should be more concerned with teaching my cat not to eat string. I do sort of see his point, but the reality is I tried to remind her not to do it, and it wasn't sticking. It's literally  a safety issue in my home - one that could mean life or death. If she couldn't manage to dispose of floss in the kitchen, then my only choice to protect my dumb ass cat is to remove the dangerous item. There is no \"teaching\" a cat to not use their insticts, and hunting/eating things is instinct.\n\nAITA here? I feel like no, but the way her husband acted, I'm now not totally sure.\n\n(And yes, I gave her floss back before she left. I'm not a floss thief)",

      "scenario_description": "I (34M) work in a small office with about 10 people. We share a communal kitchen, including one fridge. Over the past month, my lunch has been stolen *five times*. Not just random snacks entire homemade meals I bring from home, gone without a trace. It’s not just frustrating, it’s expensive and messes up my day.\n\nI mentioned it a couple of times in the group chat, like “Hey, someone’s been taking my lunches. Please stop.” Everyone either ignored it or sent vague messages like “ugh that sucks” or “some people are the worst,” but no one took responsibility.\n\nSo I bought a mini fridge and put it under my desk. Nothing fancy, just enough to hold my meal and a drink. I also put a little lock on it just for extra peace of mind. Since then, no more stolen lunches.\n\nWell, last Friday, one of my coworkers (I'll call her Dana, 29F) confronted me during lunch and said it was “weird and selfish” that I had a personal fridge. She said it made me “look paranoid” and “not part of the team.” I said I was tired of my food being stolen, and this was the only solution that worked. She said I should’ve just brought stuff I wouldn’t care about losing, like snacks or microwave meals, if I was so worried.\n\nA couple of others have now made little comments like, “Don't let him see your lunch he might lock it up,” or “We get it, you're special.” I’m starting to feel like the weirdo in the office just for protecting my stuff.\n\nAITA for locking up my lunch instead of letting this keep happening?",

      "scenario_description": "Hello! \n\nMy boyfriend (M31) has a dog, and when we have sleepovers, it's usually at his place since he can't leave her (the dog) alone overnight. Which is totally fine with me (F29).\n\nBut sometimes I prefer to sleep at my own place instead. Some nights I just want a night in my own bed, or maybe I have an early morning and it’s logistically easier to leave from my place instead of his.\n\nHe’s suggested a few times that he could bring his dog to my apartment so we can still have sleepovers there, but I’ve always said no. Nothing against his dog, I just don’t love the idea of a dog in my space! I also have a roommate and feel like I’d need to make sure she was okay with having a dog in the apartment too. \n\nI’m honestly not too pressed about not having a sleepover on those days, but he gets PISSED when I tell him no. He says I’m not good at compromising and am unappreciative of him putting in the effort to find a solution.\n\nThe way I see it, there isn’t really an “issue” that needs a solution…it’s not like I’m in distress because we couldn’t sleep in the same bed for 1 weekend. From his perspective, it seems like I don’t care enough to make something work, but to me it’s just not that serious for me to do something I’m uncomfortable with. \n\nAITA?\n\n**EDIT: I don’t hate dogs! I don’t not want a dog ever, but I don’t want a dog in my current space, which is why I do not have a dog of my own right now.**\n\n**Down the line, I could live with his dog (if we lived together, we’d get a new place, which would be more dog-friendly than my current apartment).**",

      "scenario_description": "Throwaway account.\n\nI (19M) was recently offered a full-time job on a military base in South Carolina. It pays $21/hr and comes with full benefits. I currently work retail in Michigan for $13/hr, so this is a major upgrade — both financially and for my future.\n\nHere’s the issue: I still live with my legal guardian (50F) and her husband (my stepdad, 54M). She got full guardianship of me when I was a kid, after my biological father passed away and my biological mother gave up her rights. She’s not related to me by blood.\n\nMy guardian and stepdad are financially struggling. He’s on dialysis five days a week, and she does Instacart for extra income. She says she can’t work a regular job because she needs to be home for his treatments. As a result, I’ve been helping cover major household expenses — my income has basically become part of their survival plan.\n\nWhen I told her about the job offer and my plans to move, she immediately said, “If we end up homeless, it’ll be your fault.” She accused me of being selfish and abandoning them. She also flipped out when I told her I’d be moving in with my \"sister\" (\"mom's\" bio daughter, 27F) - someone I’ve recently reconnected with, and who offered to let me stay with her family until I find my own place.\n\nTo clarify:\n\nMy \"sister\" and \"mom\" don't have a good relationship. Or any relationship now. You see, when I was 13, my \"sister's\" bio father bought her a car, and her and her husband decided to move to SC. My \"sister\" tried to convince me to move to SC with her because \"mom\" is a \"narcissist and toxic.\"\n\nI didn't believe her then.\n\nIf I had moved with her to SC, \"mom\" could've reported her for \"kidnapping.\"\n\nSince the move, my \"mom\" and \"sister\" are estranged. My \"sister\" even ignored \"mom\" while visiting for my high school graduation.\n\nMy \"mom\" despises her and sees me staying with her as betrayal.\n\nI feel incredibly torn. I do care about them and I’ve been helping financially, but I don’t want to stay stuck in a dead-end job forever. I offered to continue sending them money once I’m financially stable, but that apparently isn’t enough.\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "(26F) have been staying at my dad’s place for a bit while I look for a new apartment. He lives with his girlfriend (36F) and her daughter (13F). It’s been okay lately  howecer honestly kind of awkward. I try to stay out of the way, keep to myself,  I always clean up after myself, etc. I’ve never been super close with his girlfriend, but I always been polite.\nThe other night, my dad mentioned they were going out to dinner and said I should go with them. He said it might be nice for us all to spend a little time together and get out of the house. I agreed, thinking it’d be chill and maybe a good chance to ease some of the weirdness.\nHe wasn’t coming, he had some work stuff, but I figured as the one suggesting it, I was genuinely welcome. We got there and my father's girlfriend told the host, \"table for two\" and then turned to me and said something like, \"Oh, I thought you were just tagging along. This is a little celebration just for her\"\nI was kind of stunned. I didn’t want to make a scene so I just said “oh okay” and walked off. I ended up getting takeout nearby and Ubering home.\nWhen I got back my dad asked how dinner was and I just said, “Apparently I wasn’t invited after all.” Now his girlfriend is saying I overreacted and made her look bad, and my dad’s stuck in the middle. Her daughter also gave me a weird look when they got back, like I had ruined the night or something.\nI don’t think I’m entitled to a free meal or anything, but I was told I was invited. It just felt really crappy to be treated like an afterthought. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I forgot to mention that next to the restaurant we went, there is a place that I usually meet with my friends and my father's gf knowns about it because she took me a couple of times. So maybe she thought I am headed that way? ",

      "scenario_description": "So my (f31) ex husband (m33) just broke up in March of this year. I won’t go into details about it but he sprung it on me quite suddenly. We just bought a house together a little over a year ago and we’ve both been living there in the meantime while I look for a new place to live and our lawyers figure out the financial details. I’m not particularly attached to the house so I don’t mind moving but it takes time. \n\nI currently have one 14 year old chihuahua mix who was my dog before I met my ex husband so I will be keeping the dog with me.  Ex loves dogs and spoke a lot about wanting to get another dog. He even showed me specific other dogs he had been considering just a few weeks before he dumped me. He now tells me the one of the reasons he wanted another dog so bad was that he could have a dog that was just his. \n\nHe recently sent me a message asking if it would be okay for him to get another dog soon, while I’m still in the house. I told him no because he works quite a bit and I don’t have a day job (I’m an artist) so I’d be the one at home all day taking care of this new dog. I also said it was unfair to my dog to make him socialize with a new dog all of a sudden, especially since we won’t be staying here. My dog is old and not super friendly to other dogs. \n\nI do feel a little bad that ex still helps with my dog but him and my dog have lived together for like 8 years so of course my dog still loves him and asks for attention from him. The dog doesn’t know what’s going on. It’s also not like he needs very much care. Ex just gives him food in the morning and lets him outside a few times and lets him snuggle with him. \n\nEx said that he didn’t expect this whole divorce/me moving out process to take so long and tried to make me feel guilty by saying a lot of the dogs he looks at are at shelters where they’ll be put down soon if they’re not adopted. \n\nAm I the asshole for just telling him to wait and not look at new dogs until I’m gone?",

      "scenario_description": "Back story: I’ve (30F) been with my husband (31M) for 10 years and always had a fine relationship with his family. They’re generally nice to me but a bit stand off-ish, I think that’s just their vibe. \n\nSince my husband and I got married 5 years ago, I’ve made an effort to help plan things with his family like I do with mine. Every time it’s one of his parents birthdays, I reach out a week or two before to both of his parents and his siblings to plan a dinner or having them at our house to celebrate. Even for my husband’s grandma’s and grandpa’s birthdays will I do this, plus Mother’s and Father’s Day. \n\nHere is the breaking point:\n\nThis past weekend for Father’s Day, my husband was unavailable in the afternoon and so I reached out to my BIL, SIL, FIL & MIL and let them know that we would be able to something at night or in the morning before or after my husbands appointment. They all said to just let them know. I was busy that week and told my husband it was his responsibility to figure out what we were doing for Father’s Day with his family. Sunday came along and my husband called his dad in the morning and asked what he was up to and he said that my BIL and SIL were at the house having breakfast with him. They had not reached out to my husband and I, not even a text to invite us as well. \n\nAnd this isn’t the first time, in November, for my FILs birthday, my MIL reached out the day before and mentioned that they have had plans for weeks to go to lunch with my BIL & SIL and since we asked about their plans we could just come with them. \n\n\nAt this point, I am feeling petty and told my husband that I’m no longer planning ANY events for his family. If they are going to do stuff and not invite us then I’m not going to stretch myself thin to put in effort for these people. Especially when my SIL gets a gushing FB post every year for her birthday and I don’t even get a text for mine. \n\nMy brother told me he agrees with me but that it is kind of an asshole move- do we agree with this? \n\n",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nMy husband and I live in a farming area and have an <1 year old and a 5yr old German shepherd. Nighbors got 2 golden retriever puppies shortly after they moved in a year or so ago.They didn't really train them and when the dogs would see us they would run over and jump up on us, not listen when being called back, etc. It wasn't unusual to see our neighbors on our porch or in our yard trying to get them.Overall though we didn't really have an issue with it as our dogs would play together.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, my husband was out with the baby in the driveway and the puppies run over, start getting into the babies face and won't listen when being called to get away. The owner doesn't come over to get them just stands in their yard yelling. Our baby starts crying bc they won't get out of it's face, so my husband grabs the dog by the collar and quickly pulls it away causing the collar to come off(it's the kind of collar where you feed it through the square and the tension holds it, no buckle or belt type closure). He gets the dog back to our neighbors house, goes back and hands them the collar while holding the still crying baby. Our neighbor freaks out and starts yelling at him \"what did you do to my dog?\" No question about if the baby was ok or what happened. \n\nA few days after we're out back and our neighbor's dad is mowing their lawn(husband is on vacation, wife is home) walks over with and attitude asking why we're mistreating their dog. \n\nWe said we've never and he says they have us on their Ring.  We repeat that we never have and try to explain what happened the other day. he  cuts in \"they're not going to hurt the baby\" I said \"I know that, but my baby doesn't know that!\" and he replied \"they're just puppies, they don't know better\"...\"let's keep the dogs in their own yards from now on\" We said fine and he walked away.\n\nI sent a text to our neighbor telling him about the interaction with his dad, the accusations and sorry if our dog has ever been a nuisance in their yard(ours will wander over on occasion but comes back when called and listens if we say \"stay\"or \"leave it\"). He texts back that no one ever said anything about ab**e and they were upset bc of how forcefully my husband pulled on the collar, they were just puppies and they would never treat our dog that way. \nTheir dogs have come over to our yard a few times since but we just ignore them and go inside while they yell from their yard at the dogs to come back.  Yesterday was the first time ours has wandered over and the husband yelled at us from his porch to come get our dog! \nThey've still never asked if our kid was ok, it's been all about their puppy. ",

      "scenario_description": "My son (8) and I (40f) flew home for the school holidays. I would have been content not to see my brother and his family, but I agreed to spend the weekend with them as my son and mum enjoy spending time with them. My nephew (6) had been unwell overnight. I questioned how sick he was and whether we should be going. I didn't want us get sick for our own sake, but also because he wouldn't be able to see his ore family. Mum was annoyed but spoke to my brother, who said nephew was fine, they were just tired after a rough night, we should still come. Mum and I were going to look after all the kids on Saturday night while my brother and his wife went to a party...probably why he was so keen for us to come; they  hadn't factored us into their weekend otherwise. My hesitation was met with an icy demeanour from mum so I agreed to go, lest the rest of our trip be ruined by her mood. When we arrived it was clear my nephew was still quite unwell. He was on the lounge with a sick bucket. My brother even remarked, \"yeah, he's really unwell\". Turns out he'd been vomiting overnight with a fever. My mother made it clear through her demeanour and tone that I was meant to pretend all was fine. I was too furious and uncomfortable to do that. Similar scenarios have happened before, resulting in my son, husband, and I  becoming quite unwell. My brother then left with the kids to pick his daughter (9) up from her first birthday party of the day. I told my mum it was really disrespectful that they'd done this again, and that I was absolutely furious. I could have been more calm and more diplomatic, but the gaslighting and denial of my right to be and express upset was too much. I asked for their street address so I could book a taxi home for me and my son. She insisted that she would leave too, although she eventually agreed that I could drive her car back if my brother could drive her home on the Sunday. He couldn't do that as he and his wife had too many plans, notwithstanding our visit. So we all left and the rest of our stay with her (2 days) was either silent treatment or ice cold responses. I tried to talk to her about how hurtful it was to be treated like that, which only made it worse.

We're not even fully unpacked, when my wife's parents said \"hey next month can we come stay 3 nights over the weekend?\" It would be her mom, dad and the two youngest siblings. The week they asked they changed their mind, packed the car and just drove here. They got here on a Sunday and said we're only staying 3 nights. Then 2 nights into it said we want to stay 1 more night. \nNow her sister wants to come up here and spend the weekend. This whole week there's a few people staying over. I WANT EVERYONE GONE. I'm working late to not come home. My routine is gone. I need to mow and do other house chores. They keep our toddler up late and just sit at the table drinking beer. Yeah sure they bought us some great house gifts and I feel twisted. \nI do care about them and want my wife's family and want her to see them. \nAm I the asshole for telling my wife never to do this again and asking them to leave early?

      "scenario_description": "Sorry if this is messy, I’m still pretty mad right now. I (27M) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for the past year. We work together, so I moved in to his apartment a couple months ago as well. Things were going good we went on dates and all the other stuff. There has been a big problem though.\n\nI have loved bicycling ever since I was a little kid. I used to bike to work and it was the best part of my day. When I moved in though he was very against the bicycle. He said it would make his rug dirty (fair enough I guess) and that there wasn’t enough room. So we kept it in the garage. I wanted to keep biking to work but he really wanted to drive with me so I stopped biking. No huge deal though.\n\nBut a week ago I Ubered back (he had left work early) from a 14 hour shift only to see my bike GONE. I freaked out, thinking that someone broke into our garage and we weren’t safe. I ran upstairs to tell my boyfriend what happened and he looked at me for a long few seconds before telling me that HE selled the bike! He said it was just taking up too much space (there was literally room for it in the garage), and that he would buy me a smaller one later.\n\nYou guys, I have had this bike for seven years. It has literally been with me through thick and thin. I admit this may be where I’m the asshole, but I flipped out and started screaming at my boyfriend. Nothing too mean but just like “how could you do this, that wasn’t your bike to sell” etc. Things got ugly when I threw my (paper) plate full of pasta at him and he started crying.\n\nI apologized but he said he needed some space and went to bed. I needed space too and things have been civil but cold between us since. Im still upset about how he selled the bike, but I recognize that I might’ve overreacted. Also, he lets me live rent free so technically it is his place to call the shots on. I dunno, what do you guys think?\n\nNOTE: the plate did not hit him, I just threw it in his general direction.",

And quite frankly,  he *knew* you loved that bike, he *knew* this would hurt you. There's a reason for doing this, part of it is to test your loyalty, part of it is to throw you off kilter emotionally so he can be the victim,  and part of it is to start the process of getting you to accept being treated poorly so you *really* respond to times he treats you well and end up more confused *when* (and this is definitely a *when*) he chooses to hurt you again to keep the cycle going.  \n\n\n**This is how abusive people start to get you to accept their behavior.** \n\n\nNTA, and watch how that plate of pasta is brought up again.  OP, if this was a mistake,  he'd be working to get that bike back **now** and will never bring it up again.  You didn't overreact, and please take a moment to consider whether this might be true. Silent treatment is abusive.  Isolation and disposing of lovex things is abusive.  He's *not* a good person,  and you're NTA. ",

      "scenario_description": "My girlfriend’s father had a business which was started by his great grandfather back in the 50s and passed through to different members of his family. His father eventually ended up being sole owner after buying out the others. The last person he bought out was his brother to whom he paid about $20,000 back in the early 80s. This business did not generate much money so he left it to become a grocery store manager while renting out the commercial property.\n\nWhen he passed, he left the property to his wife, my girlfriend’s mother. She’s (the mother) has been receiving rent, about $2800 a month, but it’s barely enough to cover taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. In most years, she takes home around $5,000. She wants to sell it for about $350,000 and use the money to travel and see family then move into a retirement community. She’s not rich and is basically living off of social security and measly rental income. \n\nMy girlfriend asked my opinion since I’m experienced with land and property so I told her I thought the asking price was too low for a commercial property sitting on an acre of land in the middle of town. She said that’s what it’s worth according to their property tax. Apparently throughout the entire history of the property, the family had been using the tax assessment to determine the price of buying in and out of the business. I told her the tax assessment and property value are two different things so I sent my appraiser out and he came back with an appraisal of about $1.2 million. They were shocked and didn’t think that was an accurate price until they started getting offers after it was listed. After some bidding, they came to an agreement with a buyer for almost $1.5 million. The closing is next week.\n\nWhen their family found out, things exploded. Everyone who’s still alive thought they got ripped off for the past buyouts, some dating back to the 60s. They want their fair share of the selling price but that’s almost impossible because we’re talking about a dozen people with some owning half of the business at some point. Now the family her mother was wanting to visit are threaten to sue. It’s been stressful on my girlfriend and she’s taking it out on me. Last night she told me that things might have been better if I didn’t bring up the appraisal since all it did was tear her family apart.\n\n\n\n",

I started experiencing severe stomach pain (it's also my time of the month) and wasn't feeling well. When my grandma invited me to a rugby game, I told her I didn't feel up to it due to the pain. She was understanding.\n\nHowever, when my mom got home and I explained my situation, she accused me of faking it and called me lazy and useless. She compared me unfavorably to my older brothers, saying they're good at everything. When I tried to calmly explain how I felt, she yelled at me. I lost my temper, called her a bitch, and ran off crying.\n\nTo make matters worse, my dad and brothers seem to think I'm being unreasonable and that I should just \"toughen up\" and deal with it. Since then, I've been ignoring my mom and acting like she doesn't exist. I'm also considering staying with my grandparents for a while to cool off.

Unfortunately I’m asking because I’m possibly in a state of being gaslit OR i actually can’t take a joke and I can’t see it. My FIL (late 50s) is known for being VERY playful - goofy some would even say. Well him, my MIL (late 50s) and 3 sibling in-laws (20M & 27M28F-married couple) came to stay with my husband and I at our home (28F30M) and to see our new LO (7 months).\n\nWell LO was put to bed and we were all in the living room area hanging out, doing stretches, just casually talking, when FIL decided it would be funny to start humping the ground out of no where. And unfortunately it was directly in front of me (not MIL).  Mil and I looked at each other in shock while his children all laughed and chuckled. FIL made it clear that the gesture was meant for his wife despite it being directly in front of me (with eye contact) so we dropped it. The night passed, they left town, and after a few days of not being able to shake the image in my head, I decided to talk with my husband about how uncomfortable it made me ALONG WITH other sexual jokes he makes about us all being married and etc.\n\nThere’s been this big divide now on how I’m always ruining the fun, how it was “just a joke” and not a sexual gesture, and how I’ll always find a problem when my husbands family is in town. His family thinks this however, when I speak with my mom, sister, cousins, and anyone on my side of the world, they see his “joke(s)” and “gesture” as totally inappropriate. My FIL tried to make the point that I’ve done TikTok dances in his home with the other sibling in laws and my husband and he’s never felt uncomfortable because he knows they’re harmless and that it’s not fair for me to judge him about this vs knowing his intent (which was to just make a joke). My point is, even though I’m not on tiktok and I don’t post videos, everything I’ve done is postable, him slow stroking the ground is not.\n\nMy husband got mad at me for not seeing it as a joke and so did the other married siblings who were in the room that were raised by FIL.\n\nSo AITAH for saying that my FIL humping the floor in my home/presence made me uncomfortable and drawing that boundary.\n\nI genuinely would appreciate feedback because I plan to have another conversation soon and I want to know that I’m coming into the conversation grounded in reality.",

      "scenario_description": "I (24F) live in an apartment building and have a neighbor, Kyah (27F), who’s friendly but a bit careless. Over the past six months, Kyah’s borrowed several things from me tools, a ladder, even my Wi-Fi password when her internet was down. I didn’t mind at first, but she’s terrible about returning stuff. My screwdriver set is still missing, she kept my ladder for weeks until I asked for it back, and she used my Wi-Fi for a month without offering to chip in for the bill. Each time, I’ve been polite and let it slide, thinking she’d get better about it. Last weekend, I ran into Kyah at the grocery store. She was at the checkout with a cart full of stuff but realized she’d forgotten her wallet. She asked if I could cover her $85 bill, promising to pay me back that evening. I hesitated because of her track record with my stuff and because I’m on a tight budget myself. I told her I could spot her $20 for essentials but couldn’t cover the whole bill, especially since it included things like expensive snacks and beer. She got frustrated, saying I was unneighborly and that she’d have done the same for me. She ended up leaving most of her items behind and only buying what she could with the cash she found in her pocket. Since then, Kyah’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and another neighbor said Kyah called me stingy. I feel bad because I know forgetting a wallet is stressful, and maybe I could’ve helped more since we’re neighbors. But I also feel like her pattern of borrowing without reciprocating made me wary. \n\nAITA for not covering her full grocery bill?",

      "scenario_description": "I (31 F) am expecting my first child (gender unknown) with my husband (32 M). We have been discussing (arguing about) a name for the last 8 months and now I'm afraid there is going to be a tug of war at the hospital over the birth certificate.  Stylistically we want very different things. I like \"classic\" names. To give a few examples for a boy's name: Martin, Silas, Calvin. My husband prefers more unique names--he suggested both Artemis and Entrari from his favorite work of fiction. I don't want to name our child after a fictional assassin and he doesn't want to name his child after \"an old man.\" Combining one \"old man\" name with one \"unique name/fictional refernce\" seems to create a really wierd sounding combination and  we are both arguing over the first name anyway. I would love for this to be a \"one no two yes\" situation and for both of us to be happy with the child's name, but he hates every single name I suggest and I really don't care for any of his suggestions. I do feel as though I should have a little more influence over the name, if only because he automatically gets the child's last name, no questions asked. I told him that the child could have whatever name he picked out, on the condition that they get my maiden last name and he refused (I don't actually expect them to have my last name. I was just trying to express that I understand how important the last name is and I would accept his first name suggestion if I had the priviledge of automatically assuming the last name). I am getting less and less excited about the arrival of the child, because it is surrounded by disagreement after disagreement. I feel like I'm not getting to name the child something that means a lot to me, names that I have had in my notes app since I was in high school. He said that he doesn't want to sigh (out of distaste) every time he has to call out this child's name. Am I the asshole for really sticking to my guns when it comes to the child's name? Does anyone have any suggestions for compromise? ",

(I have a Samuel, aka 'Sammy', 'Sammer Jammer' and 'Seriously,  enough with the Mr. Chicken Jokes.')

      "scenario_description": "Hi all! Needed some advice on this issue because I personally feel I have done nothing wrong. My (20M) ex bf (21 M) broke up with me randomly after some distance and his refusal to come to our 6 month dinner I had planned to hang out with his friends. It was an amicable split and I decided to end things after he told me that he was “claustrophobic” in our relationship and he had broken up with all his previous partners for this issue. He had texted me immediately after this phone call saying he loved me and wanted to spend the rest of his life with me, but I stayed firm in my decision because I didn’t want to stay with someone who could be unsure again in the future.\n\nOnto the actual issue; I attended an event with two of my friends. He happened to be there and came up to me talking to me as if nothing had happened (this was a few months after we split). I was cordial but blunt with my answers because I didn’t want to talk to him and just wanted to enjoy my night. He then texted me after this at 5am telling me I “needed to work on my communication”. \n\nI texted him later on telling him I had no interest in this and we weren’t close enough for this to be an issue. He told me he would “be respectful” if around me which I stated was common decency (?). For context, there was a girl at this party who I was speaking to and becoming close with so could he mean this is not respectful? I told him this felt like a pointless conversation and he told me he just wanted to be clear. I replied that this was baffling and have not replied to him since. I was telling a friend about this today (21M) and he told me I was harsh while laughing so I wondered AITA? ",

      "scenario_description": "I (22F) got pregnant after a one-night stand with a friend. I’ve been trying to involve the dad in everything he rarely responds to my messages and when I do get replies it’s usually his mam. She has 5 sons but always wanted a daughter, since I’m having a girl she sees it as her second chance.Lately it’s felt like she’s trying to take over. Early on I said I didn’t want our parents controlling decisions but his mam relays messages through my mam instead of coming to me directly. If I text him about the baby he ignores it or I get a message from his mam.\n\nThe first conflict came because I can only have two people in the delivery room, I chose my mam and cousin, people who will comfort me. I plan to have him come in right after birth for bonding time. But before I could explain that, his mam said she wanted to be there, and later messaged me saying she was “heartbroken” I wouldn’t let him be there and that it was unfair.\n\nLater, I tried to talk to him about the first weeks after birth. I plan to breastfeed and need to recover, so I asked if he could come to mine for visits during the first couple weeks. I said he’s welcome to come every day, even stay over. After that I’d be happy to start taking turns going to his or going out together. He didn’t respond but I got a message from his mam. She said it was “totally unreasonable” to expect him to come to me and that he wants the baby overnight once a week at her house. She suggested I sleep there because “he doesn’t like sleeping out” I ended up making a group chat with both our mams and him to explain that I’m only asking for the first two weeks and I’m open to compromise after that. But she doubled down saying I’m making all the decisions without involving him.\n\nThe only decision I made without him was choosing godparents. Everything else, names, prams, baby clothes. I’ve included him in. He picked his own godparents too. The only thing I said no to was naming the baby after himself if it were a boy because I don’t like the idea of juniors.\n\nShe argued that him visiting at my house isn’t “real” bonding time, even though I said my family would step out during visits and that he could have time alone with the baby while I nap or shower. Then she posted on Facebook about how she’s “finally getting her little girl,” and now she’s saying he should go to a solicitor so she can have a custody schedule in writing for her peace of mind. I don’t want to drag my baby into legal stuff or create tension this early. I had a complicated relationship with my own dad and don’t want that for her. I want her dad and his family involved but not if it’s going to come at the cost of my mental health or ability to recover and bond with my baby in peace. His mam says she doesn’t want her son upset but doesn’t seem to care about me or my baby’s wellbeing. I’ve started overthinking everything and wondering if I’m being too controlling or unreasonable.\n\nSo AITA for trying to set boundaries?",

I wasn't allowed to eat dinner with them, my parents would eat with him and when he was finished he could leave and then I could get my food. I didn't even really understand what was going on, because I was a little kid.\n\nI was often alone, because I couldn't go anywhere with them and would trigger him and when we did something together it didn't feel the same, because even alone, I was always scared to do something wrong and get yelled at. Even in school I would barely talk or laugh.\n\nI was never very close with my family and spend most time alone in my room or with friends outside.\n\nSince my brother moved out my parents are trying to get me to connect with them more. This morning my mom asked me if I wanted to go see a movie with her and I was already in a bad mood, because I was stressed due to exams, so I sorta just snapped and told her I didn't want to and to stop trying to fix things with me, because it was ruined and that she couldn't fix the neglect they put me through simply by watching a movie with me. She then yelled back at me and told me to stop being jealous of my brother and that they were doing the best they could and that they didn't wanna neglect me and just tried to take care of my brother.\n\nI just left after that and both my parents have been ignoring me all day and now I feel kinda bad, I still rlly love them\nATAH?\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT UPDATE: So I dont know how many people are still gonna see this considering its probably not shown on the main page anymore, but I wanna provide at least a little update here. Many people suggested I show this post and the comments to my parents and I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do, considering the whole situation in general, but I did do it a few hours ago and it didn't go too well. They went on a rant about how people on the internet dont know anything about me and our family (which is true obviously, but still idk what that adds to the situation considering they know everything I wrote in my post is true) and that I should stop believing what people tell me on the internet, because all they want it drama and they dont care about me. Well didn't go too well, my parents have been and are still yelling at each other in the living room right now and I'm just sitting here. I wouldn't be surprised if they take my phone away, but oh well who cares as this point. I'm thinking about maybe going to my teacher and telling her, because I don't really know what to do right now.",

      "scenario_description": "I (30F) don't like bananas. I think they're gross. I don't like the flavor, the texture, the smell. I would honestly love to never have to interact with one. My boyfriend (31M) knows this, he's known since he met me 6 years ago. He thinks it's hilarious.\n\nWe met working in a restaurant where I was a server/bartender and he was a cook. We both love food and the hospitality industry so he thinks it's ridiculous for me to have such strong feelings of distaste for bananas when we literally work with food in the food industry. Also I have eaten/touched bananas before (didn't like them), it's not like it's a phobia or anything.\n\nAnyway it's not really an issue as we don't ever buy bananas or have them in the house, but on the very rare occasion that he does buy bananas (once every 3 years? not even?) he always tries to fuck with me with the banana in some way. He'll chase me around with the banana peel or leave the banana peel on my laptop or on the floor for me to slip on like mario kart. To be clear, I love pranks. LOVE them. I was all about the smoking toilet prank, we prank each other all the time. I just reeeeally hate being pranked with the bananas.\n\nToday he went to eat a banana and I turned around and the peel was sitting on top of my laptop and I just lost it. I insisted he throw it out, I did not want to touch it, or interact with it. He was dying laughing, went and got ANOTHER banana, and ate that banana on the couch right next to my laptop, trying to get me to come over and give him a kiss (mouth full of banana my literal nightmare) or move the peel myself. And I got upset and insisted he get rid of the banana and just kept telling him that this particular thing is not funny to me and I don't like it. He finally threw out the peel and said I'm being ridiculous and overly dramatic. So AITA/overreacting about the bananas? I just don't want banana pranks with real bananas.",

      "scenario_description": "Long story short, my boyfriend's mom is poor and had to move in to my boyfriend and I's apartment last month because my boyfriend's brother (who lived with her) got them both evicted. He stole her car and wrecked it into their apartment and almost killed someone. He's currently in rehab and before she moved in, I sat down with my boyfriend and laid out the requirements of her living here: she must cut off contact with his brother for his own good and never invite him over, as I'm afraid of him retaliating at our apartment and getting us evicted too, and she should stop enabling him with a constant safety net to continue his drug use (I know that sounds harsh but it was the only way to actually force him to get help, this has been an almost decade-long battle of her enabling him and he's not getting any better). My boyfriend agreed to this and she agreed. Cut to two weeks in, I come home from work. My boyfriend and her are laughing about how they took his brother to Golden Corral when I was gone and he was so high he was nodding off in the food. I was so upset that not only did she break the cardinal rule that I set for her but that my boyfriend went along with it and did it too. I told him I felt betrayed and that he just set a precedent to her that she can do whatever she wants now because any rule set isn't actually going to be enforced, clearly by his example. He told me he did it because he thought it was too harsh after the fact without telling me he had changed his mind, and thereby going against our agreement. I otherwise wouldn't have let her live here rent-free. My boyfriend said putting her on the street was too harsh of a punishment for breaking the rules, but isn't that the point? Now she's telling us we need to do HER chores when we pay the rent, because she doesn't want to do them, knowing he won't enforce or kick her out because he ultimately can't face the guilt of doing so. He has attachment issues with her and a heavy guilt complex.\n\nOur apartment lease is up in a couple months and now that we're moving, she asked us \"So where are WE moving to?\" fully expecting a free-ride and free rent at our next place. I was so dumbfounded because she is only supposed to be here until she got housing, but low income housing waiting lists can be months to years long. I don't want to live with her anymore because she walks all over us and causes tension between my boyfriend and I. He will never put her on the street because he's controlled by his guilt. When I asked what he plans to do, he said he isn't taking her to our next place, but that would ultimately leave her on the street and I know deep down even if we initially move without her, she will be back in a week or two because he'll feel guilty. \n\nI want to move into a studio apartment now knowing that I don't believe he's going to let her go, and I've voiced this as a real possibility to him, but I'm being framed as trying to dismantle our relationship. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Husband (we will call Brad), and I have been together 2.5 years. Had our son in January. Things have been pretty great, but this had me feeling kind of...annoyed?\n\nBrad is diagnosed with autism and ADHD, which can make communication between us challenging at times, but we do our best.\n\nWe live in Europe, NOT US.\n\nSince Brad has AuDHD, he only works at 50%, the other half is covered by a health insurance here on a temporary basis, and every few months he has to keep applying for more. It is stressful, as we wait for him to hopefully get on a permanent coverage. Since this is so up in the air, instead of me taking a full year of mat leave, he took a majority of the days in case his temp health insurance is denied for some reason, then he can keep his work schedule at 50% and still get paid on the days he has off.\n\nWhich means I went back to work part time. I WFH as a private teacher. I choose my hours, since my students USUALLY live in different countries, I chose some in the afternoon when Brad is home with our son, and at nights, when my students would be awake and Brad is also home. I only have one student in the evening, 23:00 - 23:30 twice a week.\n\nThis is to help with some income, and we discussed this before I event went back to work. He had asked no students past midnight. So if Baby is having issues sleeping, he can take care of him and hopefully get him to sleep.\n\nWell, Brad got back on a schedule where he wants to go to bed at 23:00...every night. We try to, but with a baby, sometimes...it just does not happen. Baby sometimes will stay asleep when I put him to bed (I nurse him to sleep), and sometimes he wakes up screaming.\n\nWell, last night I told Brad I had my student at 23:00, and I would try to have Baby sleeping by then. He asked me, \"What is your plan if Baby wakes up? My bedtime is 23:00, so hopefully you have thought of something.\"\n\nI said, \"Well, hopefully he stays asleep. If not, you will just have to take care of him, or put him on his play mat and entertain him.\"\n\nHe resolutely said, \"Bedtime is 23:00, and I will go to bed.\"\n\nCome 23:00, Baby is in bed, and Brad is just getting out of the shower. I guess he woke up moments after I started with my student, as when I came out of the office, he was walking around with Baby. I took him, nursed him back to sleep and went to bed also shortly after 23:30.\n\nThis morning, he was a bit annoyed with me. When I tried to hug him good-bye as he was leaving to work, he did not hug me back. We always do this before he leaves, so I said, \"Are you upset with me still?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Yes, you crossed my boundry. My bedtime is 23:00. We disucssed this. I go to bed, and anything past that is your problem to solve if Baby wakes up.\"\n\nHe left for work...and I was just thinking...what??\n\nI feel I need to have some discussion with Brad about this, but WIBTAH if I told him he has no more boundries with his sleep and he is being ridiculous?\n\nEDIT: Update in comments/profile",

      "scenario_description": "Sorry if this is disorganized english is not my first language.\n\nA bit of context, I (19m) am a college student pursuing a teaching degree, a part of my career includes some semesters in which I have to do actual teaching work at a school, school starts at 8am but to avoid traffic jam I'd wake up at 5 and leave at 5:30-5:40. My brother (23m) had recently gotten a job with similar starting hours as my practice and since we had to share half of the route anyway we decided that we'd leave the house together.\n\nSo queue the incident, one day I woke up half an hour late to what I'm used to, no big deal but he was already prepared, so I asked why he couldn't wake me up if he saw me oversleeping, he told me it wasn't his responsibility, and I answered that while that was true, I \"could not see any reason why he'd choose not to. We sleep on the same room, we wake up at the same hour, I'd understand if he had to go out of his way to shake me awake but that wasn't the case\" I wasn't angry, just confused but he responded very defensively, arguing that if I couldn't wake up on my own it was my problem, that I couldn't blame him for my own irresponsibility and that's he's not my alarm clock.\n\nThis stroked me as odd because I wasn't blaming him nor did I ask him to wake me as an obligation; waking eachother up when one of us overslept or had something to do early in the morning was just something that we had always done as part of sharing the room so I thought we were okay on that front.\n\nBy this point I was getting frustrated as the situation devolved into an argument, I told him that he was acting like saving me from oversleeping was something that he had to always; it had happened more than once, sure, but it was nowhere near as frequent or consistent as it'd have to be for him to justify acting like I was using him like a crutch. He denied this and told me that if I just \"slept earlier I'd not wake up late\" I've had problems with my sleeping for a couple years now as remnants of the pandemic, I don't sleep late but I wake up in the middle of the night, this is something that he knows. I told him that was unfair, he didn't hold this standard to anyone else on the family when they did oversleep, that he was taking a very corporate(?) approach to the entire situation and that if that was the hill he was going to die on I thought he was evil for choosing not to wake me up (plus, that if he tried to wake me up and I didn't, it'd no longer be his problem, but he didn't even try).\n\nWe would have continued to argue but the entire thing was aggressively shut down by my father who was overhearing the conversation and told me I was crazy; we brought it up again a couple days later where the same thing happened and recently my brother brought it up a third time as a part of a different argument to use as a claim that I always want to be right, but do I? I don't think I'm in the wrong but I don't want to be entitled. What do you guys think?",

I don't know my sister-in-law very well but she seems very sweet. She had offered to rub sunscreen on my mom. After SIL was finished with my mom, I asked SIL if she can rub sunscreen on my back. She said she was happy to and she did. \n        But that evening, my brother confronted me. He said his wife has many issues including social anxiety. He said she has a problem saying no. He said she told him how uncomfortable she felt putting sunscreen on my back. He told me it was inconsiderate of me to ask someone who's not in Healthcare to touch diseased skin. \n           SIL continued being very sweet to me and my mom. My brother seemed cold with me and he was very protective of his wife. Am I the asshole ?",

Some people go from dead-fish to burned in twenty minutes.  \nIt's also weird to agree, say you're \"happy to do it\" and then complain about it. I'm assuming your back was visible,  no?\n\nIt's weird that your brother *knows* that she has social anxiety and either hasn't brought it up before or didn't step in. How are you supposed to know? \nAND for all you know,  she was quietly venting and didn't want a confrontation.  I bet your brother made her anxiety worse.\n\n\nStrong NTA from me, there were plenty of opportunities for people to prevent this discomfort and nobody else bothered. Your only fault here was needing sunblock, not being double jointed, and lousy hormones.  (Or whatever caused you to have this.)",

She doesn’t want kids. She’s too girly then not girly enough. She can seem cold at first because she is a little reserved. And on and on and on\n\nIt has been hard. I was close to my brother. But he led the charge early on because she called him out for something and he didn’t like it. He’s the favorite so they took his side. My little sister is the most neutral. I’ve tried to talk to them about it so many times but eventually just realized it wasn’t going to change. I love my wife. I have no regrets. \n\nThis past Christmas will be the last. They didn’t give her any gifts, excluded her from the cookie party, and I caught mom and my aunts talking about her twice. I got us early flights and took her skiing.\n\nHer dad loves me. We have weekly cigar walks. Her mom drops by just for hugs. Her brothers and I have our own group chat. Her sister baked me a fucking birthday cake. It should be this way with my family. I’m trying not to be all emo but this shit hurts.\n\nMy brother (the favorite) is having his first child in July. They have asked me (not us) to come meet him. I told them no. I’m sick of the bullshit. Unless everything changes, I’m not going to waste my money. Mom got on the phone and told me I don’t have to bring her, I should just come myself. I said no, we’re married, we’re a package deal. \n\nShe twisted it to “Oh so she won’t let you come unless she comes too?” and I told her no, I’m saying this. I’m sick of them treating her like shit. It’s Jerry Springer levels of trashy. Dumb thing to say and it set her off listing all the grievances they have with her. Some of it is just stupid. She carries a water bottle wherever she goes. Yeah, mom, she’s from fucking California. We all do. \n\nDad jumped in to back up mom and accused me of holding adult problems against an unborn child. Said that I’m really going to not be a part of my nephew’s life because my wife can’t get along with the rest of the family. This is what I’m stuck on. Am I wrong? I do want to be in my nephew’s life and it isn’t his fault. But it feels wrong to reward them because it just won’t ever end.",

      "scenario_description": "I’m a 23-year-old woman living in an extremely religious and strict family.\nHow strict? From tiny details like my clothing, nail polish, or even how I eat, to more serious things like becoming independent from my family or even working outside the house — I’m constantly fighting. My parents are very sensitive about these things and believe that a girl should not move out until marriage.\nMy mom is extremely religious and has gotten more short-tempered with age. If she sees that my sister or I aren’t doing the religious things she expects, she gets deeply upset — to the point of crying at night and not sleeping.\n\nI also live in a country that doesn’t value women’s rights much and is extremely religious.\n\nMy sister is a 28-year-old woman who, when she was 23, got into a traditional marriage because of the pressures at home and then immigrated and left the country. Thankfully she is happily married and she doesn't have to take all of these behaviour in her new life.\nAfter she left, things got even stricter for me, and the attention at home shifted entirely onto me.\n\nI tried really hard to push back and make it clear that I have an independent personality and beliefs and can’t do what they want — which always led to arguments, but eventually they were forced to accept me.\n\nMy sister took the opposite approach. She visits the family once a year, and during that time, she tries to be the perfect daughter — she follows all religious rituals, pretends to pray several times a day, and wears the kind of clothes they like. She Faking it all.\nAs a result, after she leaves, the pressure on me doubles, and all the acceptance I’d fought for is reset. Now they have a solid excuse: “You should learn from your sister, look how respectful and God-fearing she is,” while I get blamed for being selfish and hurting my parents — and told that I’ll burn in hell in the end.\n\nThe last time she visited, I begged her to stop pretending to be the good daughter, because she’s only here for a month, but I’m the one who’s stuck here dealing with the pressure afterward.\nShe said she can’t bear to see our mom so sad — and continued her usual act.\nAfter she left, things got so intense that there were arguments from morning to night.\n\nMy mom had found me a traditional suitor who wanted a religious wife like herself, but since I’m not that kind of person, it didn’t work out.\nShe told me I’d embarrassed her and that I should learn from my sister and her husband.\nI couldn’t take it anymore and said, “It’s not hard for me either to be fake for a month a year and pretend.”\n\nMy mom told my sister what I said, and now she’s very upset with me. She told me I had no right to reveal her secret or make our mom more upset, and that it was up to her to share it whenever she wanted.\nHonestly, I felt really hurt that she couldn’t understand my situation. She’s the only one I usually call during fights to vent and she’s always supportive, so I didn’t want to upset her — I just apologized. But the truth is, I don’t feel like I did anything wrong.\n\nAITA for telling my sister secret?\n\n\nAnother thing I want to clarify: my mom isn't unaware that my sister is pretending. In fact, there are times when my sister calls from the country she lives in now, and my mom can clearly sense the difference in how she talks or behaves. After the call, my mom often gets very upset and cries — not because she didn’t know, but because the illusion breaks. I’m usually the one left to comfort her, telling her things like, “You’re overthinking it,” just to stop her from spiraling. She wants to believe in the version of her daughter that fits her ideals, because the truth is too heavy for her to hold.",

It sucks that her relationship creates problems for you, but that's because you and your mom won't stop trying to force each other to cave to your individual preferences.

      "scenario_description": "\nMy (35f) husband’s (42m) sister is offended I won’t let her watch our children. I’ve been with my husband for almost 10 years, 4 years married. SIL (45f) is married with two children and lives in Minnesota. We have always seen them 3 or 4 times a year. We’ve always had a pretty good relationship but we’re definitely not close by any means. We don’t speak unless in person or I’ll pop on and say hi if my husband is on FaceTime with her. He is not close with her either.  We have watched their kids when they come to town to visit a handful of times so that they can do a date night. \n\nAnyway, husband and I had a baby two years ago & we’re currently pregnant with another baby. We found out about 9 months ago that SIL has been drinking all day while at work. She was working from home & hiding bottles of liquor under her bed, etc. She’s gained a lot of weight over the last few years & is extremely puffy. Being a nurse I figured she may be having some thyroid issues or something of the like but never pried or inserted myself. Her husband gave us SOME details such as if she would’ve continued on the path she was on she would’ve died, that the kids had started wondering where she was/why she was always in bed, and that she quit her job to attend a 30 day rehab. We haven’t heard anything about it since nor has my husband asked. If it was my family I would check in & be blunt & ask how my sister is doing. My husband’s family is very much the kind that if nobody talks about it then everything is fine. They stick to the weather mostly & safer topics. \n\nWhen we go to Minnesota SIL tells us to go out on dates or whatever & leave our kid with them. She is very pushy and doesn’t let it go. I will probably NEVER feel comfortable leaving my kids with her now. She has started probing my husband already about being able to watch the kids when baby number 2 is here in July. Husband says it’s only fair since we watched her kids. I disagree. She is seemingly offended and won’t let it go.\n\nAITA? ",

      "scenario_description": "\nMy husband has been tested for ADHD, but he doesn't have it. He has the kinds of problems that are associated with ADHD, however.  \n\nHe says writing lists, making a schedule, setting alarms, etc, is physically painful for him and he'd rather just deal with ocassional emergencies rather than be proactive.  \n\nThe specific problem;  \n\nHe often forgets to push the shower diverter valve down. You know, the little rod on the tub faucet that you push down to make water fill the tub, and pull up to make the water come out of the shower?\n\nFor nearly twenty. fucking. years. I have been asking him to push that down. Since I was literally a teenager, I have been asking him to push that fucking thing down.\n\nAt least twice a month I have a VERY unpleasant wakeup/cold shower, because I turn the water on, and I get a cold spray from the shower. And every fucking time he's apologetic, and then a week or two later, it happens again.\n\nHe will do better for a while, and then it slips in again. He is always telling me that he's working on it, and hasn't he been better about it lately? But somehow he's always working on it, always improving, but it never fucking stops.\n\nToday I had just fucking had it. I stepped into the shower, turned it on, and had a very cold and rude awakening. I couldn't fucking take it anymore, I grabbed the cup by the sink and filled it about 3 inches with cold water, and walked out to where he was standing naked (he had just taken off his pajamas and was going to take his shower after mine.)\n\nWithout warning, while he was looking down, I held that plastic cup firmly in my hand, and grasping it tightly, I jerked that motherfucker in a 45 degree angle to get that cold water all over his torso and face.\n\nI told him that his apologies were worth the paper they were written on, and I was tired of listening to him congragulate himself for \"getting better\" when I had been asking for twenty fucking years to stop doing this shit. I told him I don't accept his apologies, and the fact that it's an accident does not excuse it. I told him that from now on, every time I'm taking a cold shower, so is he. That I refuse to be a second class citizen in my own home any longer, and if he refuses to make changes to treat me better, I will instead make changes to treat him worse, because I will not tolerate this any longer.\n\nI'm going to continue to surprise throw a cold cup of water on him every time I get a surprise cold shower. I'm tired of fucking *asking/begging for basic fucking respect and not getting it, with the implication that I have to fucking put up with this forever. So reddit, I know I'm probably an asshole... but am I a justified asshole?  \n\n*Edited to add the forgotten words asking/begging  \n\n*Edit to answer the questions everyone is asking;  \n\nQ:  Why don't I just check myself/why do I expect him to leave it the way I want it left?  \n\nA:I don't expect him to leave it the way I want; what I expect is for him to leave things the way he found them. When he walks into the bathroom, it's pushed down. That's how I leave it. So he doesn't get blasted with cold water. But he doesn't leave things the way he found them. Instead, he often leaves the last 10 or 20 percent of a task for me to clean up for him.  \n\nQ: Why don't I leave it the way I found it? Why don't you leave it up if he leaves it up?  \nA: If I left things the way I found them, I would live in a sty. I would also spend a great deal of energy making things messier, as I would literally be cleaning up to make space for myself, and then UNDOING that work to put things back as a mess.\n\nQ: Explain your shower to me / why are you getting in before the water is warm?!   \nA: Just gonna quote /u/Ciskakid :    \n\n>Folks, you’re misunderstanding her situation. She leans in to turn on the water EXPECTING IT TO COME OUT OF THE SPIGOT. Instead, shower mode is still in place and the water sprays out of the shower and onto her head. It is completely rude of the husband to not switch the water flow back to the spigot when he’s finished showering. This is just basic etiquette.",

But **you KNOW that he does this** and keep having cold showers? \n\n\nI am absolutely on your side because being married to people who KNOW they need to do better, and won't make any changes permanent is absolutely maddening.  \n\n\nBut at the same time, this solution has always been in your control. Push the damn thing down. Make him shower outside.  BUY A FAUCET WHERE IT GOES DOWN AUTOMATICALLY. You married an asshole and you know that by now. Adjust. ",

      "scenario_description": "I love my niece, and I support her creative expression. I’ve told her that she could make me a dress for running around the house, running errands, hanging out, etc. I’m happy to wear something she’s made at times where it’s appropriate. I’ve worn the acrylic scarf she crocheted me for a few years now and it’s not because it looks good.\n\nShe uses youtube and tiktok tutorials, so she doesn’t know how to work off patterns, make tailoring adjustments, choose the right fabric, etc. On tiktok and other social media spaces the “cool” thing to do is announce that you made your garment from a ratty thrifted sheet using an old pair of shorts you had lying around. Sometimes it looks good, sometimes it doesn't. But she doesn’t take the time to do things like pressing or finishing steams, trimming or sewing in ends, etc. When I’ve suggested it to her, she said it’s more authentic the way she does it.\n\nShe begged me to do an outfit for an event I have coming up where I’ll be on stage. I tried to let her down gently and said that I had a dress being tailored as we speak. She said I could wear that one to something else, but that I should wear something she made because it would be special and a bonding experience for us. Everyone in my family is obsessed with “bonding experiences.” Everything has to be a bonding experience between the adults and kids. It’s exhausting.  I reiterated my no, saying “No, I do not want you to make me anything.” \n\nHer mom (my sister in law) is telling me that I care way too much about my appearance and my image. This is an event related to my career. The last thing I need to do is walk up on stage in something that doesn’t fit, or looks like it was made with a sheet. And especially because I am plus sized, how I look is judged more harshly.\n\nSIL complaining about me being superficial is not new. I dared to buy ONE designer bag for myself and she did the whole thing you see on Reels, the whole “STUPID! I would just thrift a bag and put the rest of my money IN the bag!” bit. I was briefly engaged and she would not shut up about how I supposedly wanted a wedding, not a marriage because I dared to want to pick out my own decor and not just use whatever she could scrounge up on Marketplace or get for sale at the craft store.\n\nMy career is the most important thing in the world to me right now. Obviously for my SIL, her child is the most important thing in the world to her. But am I correct to put my career ahead of her child’s feelings, or do my values automatically make me the asshole?",

She's 17, if she's old enough to drive, and old enough to understand the significance of being on-stage for your work, she's old enough to understand that no is a complete sentence. \n\n\nAlso, **it's typically inappropriate to use your career to bonding with kids** outside of some limited situations like teaching. NTA the only shallow person in this post is the person who'd rather her sister tank her career than tell her kid no. ",
