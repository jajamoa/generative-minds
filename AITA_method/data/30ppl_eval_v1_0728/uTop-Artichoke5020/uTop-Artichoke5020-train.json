      "scenario_description": "My(28F) husband (30M) and I are having our first son later this year and he is due on labor day.  I had my baby shower last weekend and it was a great event, but there was one interaction that I may be the asshole for.  \n\nMy husband showed up for the gift portion.  When opening gifts, one gift was a baby care package and a onesie to the rival college my husband and I went to. It was given to us by a friend who went to said rival college.   My Husband has a pretty deep hatred of the rival school. I follow along with that since fall saturdays at football games is our thing.    \n\nWhen we opened this gift, my husband audibly said \"oh\". I could see the \"what the fuck \" look on his face.   I said, I hope a gift receipt came with this!  I thought it was a gag gift.  My friend says \"oh no gift receipt\".  I was like, oh well, \"Sons Name\" is never going to wear this. Then moved on to the next gift.  Little awkward, but whatever.  After the party, my husband threw the onesie in the trash.  \n\nA few days ago someone asked what happened with the onesie and I told them.  Well that made it around to a few people and I get a text from the friend saying that i'm a huge asshole.  I should have just given it back to her.  I was like thats what the gift receipt comment was for and told her my husband would never allow our son to be dressed like that.  I never thought it was supposed to be a legitimate gift, but apparently it was.  AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "My husband and I have been together for 12 years, married for 7. For the past year and a half, he’s been the sole caregiver for his mom, who has early dementia. He stepped up completely bathing her, dressing her, changing her, managing her meds, all of it. I work full time to support both of us so he could focus on her full time. It’s been emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausting especially for him.\n\nHe is one of six kids, and they all live within 30 minutes. Not a single one helped. Not once. It was just him and his dad, day in and day out, while the rest of the family ghosted.\n\nWell, her condition recently progressed and she had to be placed in a care home. Suddenly, everyone comes out of the woodwork like they’ve been involved this whole time. One sister-in-law made a big “family group chat” called “Sweet Mama D” and sent this dramatic message like:\n\n“Hey everyone! Mama D has been placed in a home, so let’s all continue being there for her! This is also a space to share memories and support each other!”\n\nExcuse me? Continue? Nobody but my husband and his dad have been there. What are y’all continuing exactly?\n\nAnd to make it worse I wasn’t even included in the group chat. But people from other states and even literal 13-year-old cousins were added. My husband knew I wasn’t in it but I said let’s just give it a few days. Well during those two days they continued adding others… just not me.\n\nAfter 2 days my husband added me, I immediately left the group. When asked why, I told them plainly “We gave it two days. Nobody thought to add me or even mention me. At this point, I don’t want to be in it.”\n\nNow I’m being told I’m “childish” and “making this about me,” but I’m sorry… I was there. Every single day. Supporting my husband while he broke down watching his mom lose herself. And now that she’s in a home, these people want to play loving family and post old photos like they’ve been in the trenches too?\n\nSo AITA for leaving the group chat and being over it? Or are they just mad because I didn’t pretend along with the group hug energy?\n\nEDIT: My husband and me were in bed sitting right next to each other when they group chat started and I was like “I didn’t get that message” he looked and was like of you didn’t get added. So I said let’s give it a few days because it’s a lot going on right now and after two days she added some more people and that’s when he added me. I was at work and saw I was added by him and left because I didn’t want to be in it at that point. My Sister in law made the chat and was the person adding everyone. Her husband is one of the siblings ",

      "scenario_description": "Some context: My best friend (also 29F) and I have known each other since we were five. We grew up inseparable. In high school, she became part of the popular crowd I was left behind. Around this time, I realized I was a lesbian and that I had a massive crush on her. It hurt watching her drift away and date guys, but I let her go and eventually found other friends. I even had a few relationships.\n\nThen for graduation she had this huge party and even invited me and my friends, things got weird. We were both drunk, dancing to  lana del rey we have always been huge Lana fans then we kissed. I tried not to read too much into it; she had a boyfriend at the time, and according to her socials, she kissed a lot of her female friends.\n\nLike a year after that she went through a mental health crisis and reached out to me. Her other friends had drifted away, and we reconnected. We became inseparable again, like nothing had changed. Eventually, she told me she was bisexual and had feelings for me. I’d loved her for years, but I tried not to pressure or project. Still, we ended up dating, moved in together, got a cat, the whole thing. I genuinely thought I was going to marry her.\n\nBut right before my 23rd birthday, she told me she didn’t think she was bisexual after all. That our relationship had started during a vulnerable time for her. We broke up, I moved out and we stopped talking.\n\nI was heartbroken.(still am tbh) I cried every night, stalked her socials, I haven’t had a serious relationship since.\n\nThen, three months ago, she messaged me. Said she missed being my friend and wanted to hang out. I was definitely still in love with her (I’m pathetic I know) but I said yes. We hung out until 5am that first night. She told me she’d been listening to Margaret by Lana Del Rey and fun fact, my name is Margaret! \n\nIt really was like no time had passed between us. She was engaged (which hurt), but I liked her fiancé. He seemed sweet and genuinely in love with her. Being back in her life helped me feel whole again. I started dating, feeling normal again for the first time in years. I stayed with her at her Airbnb the night before the wedding, we drank wine, listened to Lana, and she got a little handsy. I brushed it off as the wine talking. \n\nThen came the wedding. I wasn’t a bridesmaid, fair, since we’d only recently reconnected but I was honored to be invited. Everything was beautiful, until the first dance.\n\nShe chose Margaret by Lana Del Rey.\n\nYeah so she was dancing with her new husband, but staring at me, Lana was singing “when you know, you know.” And I just felt all of those feelings for her I’d been repressing come back and I felt so sick, it was like a bad fanfic. \n\nI left,  I cried so hard. \n\nShe texted and called, but I blocked her the next day. One of her bridesmaids messaged me saying I was cruel for walking out and ghosting her. I’m feeling extremely guilty. I didn’t want to ruin her wedding I just could not stay there.",

      "scenario_description": "I'm (40m) a father of 3.  My SIL (27f) and her husband (27m) had their first kid 2 years ago.  She's my wife's sister and we tend to see each other at least once a month for family events.\n\nFor my wife and I, we manage our kids ourselves.  If we go somewhere, one of us is always keeping an eye on them, making sure they're not getting into trouble - especially making sure the youngest (a toddler) is safe - changing her if necessary, refilling her sippy cup, stuff like that.  Its our job.  If something happens, one of us pops up and takes care of it.\n\nSIL and her husband take a different approach and are frequently asking for help.  If we're all eating dinner and their kid has a poopy diaper, they'll sometimes get it, sometimes turn to one of us and ask \"would you mind?\"  The other day, I'm at a party and just came back inside after getting something for my kids, ready to sit down to eat and SIL asks \"\\[Baby\\] left her sippy cup upstairs - would you mind getting it?\"  Her and her husband both sitting down and perfectly capable.  It's not like they've asked a few times when they're overwhelmed or there's only one of them - there's been times one of them is lying on a couch reaching a book and ask me for something.\n\nIt's not like what they ask for anything I'd consider a huge inconvenience, so I feel petty saying something - but part of me just wants to say \"Look, my wife and I are responsible for our kids - you're responsible for yours.  I don't ask you to change our kids' diapers or grab their sippy cups from the next room, don't ask me.\"  WIBTA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (31F) is staying with me temporarily after leaving her husband. I (30M) have a small apartment but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she’s six months pregnant. I wasn't very pleased about this situation but she is my sis afterall.\n\nThe main issue has been food. I’m pretty disciplined about what I eat because I am in bulk stage and hitting the gym regularly. I portion things, label them and plan for the entire week. But every other day something’s gone. Makes me crazy.\n\nShe’ll drink all my expensive shakes, polish off meals I’ve prepped for work, eat snacks I’ve saved for post run, and even finish leftovers I was planning to turn into new meals. When I bring it up, she shrugs and says things like “Cravings hit hard” or “Hormones” or \"You are being mean\".\n\nI asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. Or hell, manage her own food for god's sake. She refuses to do anything about it.\n\nSo last week I ordered a small mini fridge and set it up in my bedroom. It’s just big enough for my meal prep, snacks and drinks. I didn’t make a scene about it. I just quietly started putting all my stuff there.\n\nShe noticed two days later and got pissed. She said I was being “childish,” “dramatic” and “treating her like a thief.” I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights.\n\nNow she’s sulking and has told our parents after her failed marriage, her brother is also alienating her. And she is just a burden for everyone. My mom called and said I should “pregnancy isn’t easy” and especially for her situation.\n\nI don’t think I’m being cruel. I’m still letting her live here rent-free, and I’ve even offered to order food or cook together, but I just want my food to be left alone. A part of me understands she is going through trouble. But, at my expense?\n\nAITA?",

My stepdad is able to work from home. He sits in our kitchen all day and takes zoom calls, all of which are in loud volume so everyone can hear all 4-5 people on the call talk about engineering - stepdad also speaks very loudly. Our house isn’t very big and it is open concept, so the kitchen, dining room and living room are essentially one room with no walls dividing them. They’ve stayed with us in the past and taken these calls and I’ve passively asked him if he has headphones to which he replied he didn’t. The next time he visited, he apologized and said he forgot the headphones again. This time, he hasn’t said anything about headphones at all and is just letting it rip. Stepdad has also asked my toddler to “shhh” while he is on these calls even though he knows he is sitting 3 feet from the play area.  My husband, who my stepdad generally has a great relationship with, is also annoyed by this and finally nicely mentioned using headphones again or using the guest room my parents are staying in which has a desk in it. Stepdad proceeds to act hurt and packs up his laptop, notepads, etc to move into the guest room. My husband tells him he can still work there, but just to move if there are calls. Stepdad still decides to take all of his things and moves into the guest room with door closed for the remainder of the day - the energy feels tense. Are we TAs here?",

My wife was the social media manager from the beginning, but she also works a lot, she's a music teacher, and sometimes she works from the morning till night, and then she gets home really tired (why she shouldn't right?).\n\nThe thing is that I have seen her stressed with having too much in her plate and sometimes she has complained. So, I want to push my band a lot and nowadays being active in social media is crucial for growing. This being said, sometimes she can't be consistent in posting.\n\nI contacted a girl, whose job is specialty in social media management/marketing. When I told my wife, she felt betrayed and can't get over it. I told her the reason why I did it is because I've seen her struggle and I want her to focus in other aspects of the band, like performance or getting us gigs, because she's also a singer in our band, also she could have less in her plate and the band can actually start growing in social media because we could have someone who just focus on that and be cosistent.\n\nBut she feels that I made a right choice for the band to grow, but it hurts her, she feels like a replacement and that we just used her. \n\nWhat do you all think?

I have 2 German Shepards, Jameson & Guinness. My house is their house. I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   \n\nThis friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  \n\nI backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.  If you just pet them, they'll leave you alone.  After a brief convo, they decided to leave. I told them they don't call the shots at my house about my dogs.   The rest of my friends were split on how I acted. Some said it wasn't a big deal to put them in another room for a few hours and others said I was right.  AITA?  ",

      "scenario_description": "I’ve (22f) posted here about my roommate (24f) before. She has always had issues contributing to the household, including buying things like toilet paper, dish soap, laundry detergent, etc. She also rarely does her dishes promptly or takes out the trash or other household chores, and struggles to pay utilities on time. Sometimes I even have to hound her for the rent. I felt bad at first because clearly she wasn’t equipped to live alone but I quickly got frustrated and became short with her. We were friends at first but not so much anymore after I’ve had to put up with her for this long. \n\nOur year long lease ended and we have been living month to month since then. Eventually she got a boyfriend. He lives with his parents but that hasn’t stopped her from spending most of her time at their house. I started seeing her less and less. \n\nA couple days into May I hadn’t seen her for maybe two weeks. I texted and called her to see when she was going to pay her share of rent (due on the 5th) but she basically ghosted me. I got in contact with her mom and eventually my roommate reached out to say she’s staying with her boyfriend’s family “for now” and doesn’t think she should be expected to pay rent for somewhere she’s not staying. I kindly asked if that meant she would be moving out but she didn’t respond. \n\nI paid rent myself, which was a huge unexpected expense. After that I decided I was done. I texted her over the course of May and June asking her to move her stuff out but she didn’t respond to me. Her mom kept promising me that her daughter would take care of it but she never once got back to me.\n\nAfter July started I recruited a couple friends to help me pack up the stuff in her room and donated most of it to Goodwill and the Salvation Army. I also asked the landlord to change the locks which he did. \n\nThe other evening she finally shows up and is mad that the locks have been changed. I told her she’s not living here and doesn’t pay rent so she has no reason to enter the apartment. She got even more upset and said that she was never moving out, she was just staying with him for the time being. She told me the situation didn’t work out so she planned to come back and live here again. I told her that she was already off the lease and it’s my rental now. She started crying and said she had nowhere else to go and I felt really bad. She asked if she could at least get some of her stuff, she needed some clean clothes and a shower. I told her that because she never told me she was coming back or made plans to move her stuff out, I donated everything that was in her room unless it looked precious or expensive and stored the rest in her closet. \n\nShe completely freaked out and threatened to call the police on me. She was inconsolable. She cried about how I even donated her dead grandmother’s wedding dress, which had been in a special box somewhere in her room. I apologized profusely because I did feel really bad but it all could have been avoided if she had tried to communicate with me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I told her by July I would start getting rid of things if she didn’t make plans to do it herself. Where I live, a unit is considered abandoned once they vacate and owe rent. The cost of the items being donated will determine how long I need to store them before getting rid of them. I asked her to make arrangements for her things beginning in early May, which she ignored. I emphasized in June that I would be donating her things by July, which she also ignored. Additionally, her mother was aware the whole time and promised me her daughter would take care of it by June 30th, which she didn’t. ",

      "scenario_description": "My husband had been sick for a long time. I was his carer and was able to work from home to be there when he needed me. When we went to hospital I was his advocate.  His children would call or stop by just to ask for money. I even gave up a works bonus to give it all to his daughter. We took £1000 out of our limited savings to help the other with the understanding she would pay it back. We did not expect massive payments, just like £20 a month. \nMy husband finally realised what they were doing and stopped giving them money. This was about 2 years before he passed. The girls stopped calling or coming by at all once the bank dried up. \nI could see how badly it affected him, at times he would just stare off into space and say he missed them.  Both girls had changed their phone numbers and had moved from their home so we had no way to get in touch.our numbers were the same. The landline was about ten years old and the mobiles about 8 years. So they could have called anytime or stopped by as we had been at that address for 14 years. \nMy passed at the end of December. It was really unexpected as he was doing ok. I was absolutely hysterical about his death. And then I found out the corner may wish to do an autopsy as it was unexpected. \nThe time of year made a backlog of cases for the coroner, so we had to wait. \nIt took me a week to even think of notifying his daughters. I realise I should have tried to reach out earlier, but I was not doing well with the loss. \nI remembered one of the daughters having a Facebook account so I looked through and found her. I sent her the message ‘please call, urgent’\nI got a call almost immediately and told her what had happened. About 20 minutes later there was frantic knocking on the door. The younger of his girls was out there spitting fire it took me a week to tell them. She asked when the funeral was being held and we told her we didn’t know but would be  telling them the minute we found out. She accused me of lying about it and that I wouldn’t let them know when their own father’s funeral real would be. \n\nA few days later I started get text messages with ‘I want this item or that one’ it was becoming ridiculous. I rounded up everything that had been theirs and gave it to them. Plus more from the texts the asked for.\nIt was funny after 2 years of silence suddenly they wanted rings of his. \nI was finally able to arrange his funeral and a few days later his ashes were delivered to me. The final text I got from them was can we have some of his ashes for remembrance jewelry. \nI said No. I told them my husband had never even wanted me to notify them he had died…so I was going to give them any of his ashes…\nAITA for not giving them some of his ashes?\n\nEdited:\nI get that a lot of you are condemning me for the late notification of their father’s death. I understand where you’re coming from. What you have to understand is I got up to use the toilet at 3am went back to bed next to him and then woke up at 4;05 am and he was gone!. He had a DNR in place so I couldn’t even try to give him CPR. The doctor was called and I sat downstairs waiting for the results of the exam to verify his death and I honestly thought the doctor was going to say I have arranged ambulance to rush him to hospital. Instead he said his condolences. Called the police to stand guard over our bedroom u til the corner got there hours later.  \nI was in such shock I sat in his favourite chair, for days,barely ate,and just stared at nothing.  It took a week for my brain to even comprehend he was gone. Kept thinking he was just at hospital. I have learned since that the trauma of waking up next to him kind of shut my bat in down to try and protect me from the pain. \nSo I agree they should have been to,d right away, but I was in no state to think rationally and as soon as my brain stated working I tried to find a way to contact them.

I mostly ignore it.\n\nAnyway, today as I was opening my umbrella, she ran up to me and said, “Hey, share kar lete hai, waise bhi jagah hai”\n[Translation: \"Hey, move a bit. There is space.\"]\n\nI just looked at her and said, “Sorry, it's small.” And walked away.\n\nI could literally hear her say “bitch” under her breath. Later, in class, some of her friends said I was “heartless” and “mean” for not sharing in an emergency.\n\nBut I’m sorry — I’m tired of being treated like garbage and then expected to be generous.

      "scenario_description": "I (25F) live with my boyfriend Liam (24M). About a month ago, his mom Tanya began claiming she’s dying of cancer, but no diagnosis has been confirmed. Every hospital visit ends with her being sent home. A nurse even told Liam she might be faking.\n\nIt started when she stayed “one night” at our one-bedroom apartment. That turned into a week of chaos. She refused AC and fans (said they hurt her skin) but blow-dried her hair daily. The apartment smelled awful, everything had to be dark and silent, and she constantly demanded help. She even stormed into our bedroom at 3am asking Liam for massages (we sleep naked so that was awkward). She criticized our Buddhist souvenirs, insisted we hang a cross (I did), and complained non-stop. \n\nShe suggested we move in with her, an hour from our jobs/school.\n\nI’m a full-time student with two jobs and a 4.0 GPA, and I was falling behind. Liam, who works full-time, switched to remote work (his boss hated this) to care for Tanya.\n\nHer health “updates” were always shifting: MRI, canceled surgery, then chemo postponed due to infection, then E. coli. Always a new reason. No clear diagnosis or paperwork.\n\nWhen her husband David (who funds her lifestyle) was away, she made us go to her house to get her jewelry because she thinks he’ll steal it when she dies (he’s an alcoholic according to her). We were supposed to take her to the ER right after, but we ended up staying 16 hours doing chores. I folded 420 clothing items, cleaned the whole house, and felt like her unpaid maid. Not a single please or thank you.\n\nShe was stalling to go to the ER, and when we finally got there at 5 am, she said she’d check herself in, and sent us home. Three hours later, she called again, sobbing for help. She had been rejected by the ER. I suspect she faked it.\n\nLiam and I have both been skipping meals, losing sleep, and falling behind at work to help her. He once said he’s waiting for her to pass away so we can move to Europe. He’s been forced to manage her divorce, lawyer meetings, and funeral prep. Meanwhile, David \\*who’s paying the hospital bills and had been kept in the dark about all this) sent Liam aggressive texts like “I call bullshit” and “Don’t show up at my house no more,” then later apologized.\n\nTanya called again begging for help. But this time, she wanted *me,* because David is jealous of Liam. I had clearly told Liam I needed that weekend to study for final exams. And going to that house alone seemed sketchy.\n\nNow, I’m planning a 2–3 week Europe trip to see my mom, whom I haven’t seen in over a year. Liam says he supports it but called it “a little selfish.” He’s asked, “If I were dying, would you quit your job to be with me?” and “If it were your mom, would you help her?” I felt pressured to say yes. But truth is, my family wouldn’t lie to me or use me like this.\n\nI love Liam and want to be there for him. But I don’t trust his mom, and this is starting to affect our relationship.\n\n**AITA for refusing to help Tanya and going home to Europe?**",

She has a hard time keeping jobs and has other struggles. We tried living together in our 30s but it was a disaster mainly because she wouldn’t pay rent or keep a job.  I feel bad for her and give her money when I can.  I’m just afraid that if she moves in she will never leave.  I feel like I always need to help her.  She has been in therapy for years but not improving. When she drinks she gets very mean as well and I’m at the point in my life where I want my house to be my sanctuary.  I keep going back and forth on this decision but I need to think of my future older self and make that my priority at my age.  I told her no.  Am I the Asshole?",

The male child called her fat, said she was the “elephant in the room” and told her that no one liked her. My son laughed at what his friend said to the girl, while I can only imagine what she was feeling in that moment. My sons school became aware of what had happened and punished all involved with 2 days of isolation, which I agree was the correct thing to do. My sons father says that my son should not have been punished as he only laughed. Is he right? AITA?\n\nEdit to add:\nMy son is under punishment at home, he has been grounded and lost all of his devices for the foreseeable future. I have spoken with him about why it was wrong to do what he did. I have been the girl in this situation in my childhood so I understand exactly how she must be feeling right now and I will not have my child be the one to make another person feel that way. He has apologised to the girl and her parents at a school meeting today. \n\nThe instigator has been given a 3 day suspension from school. I don’t hold any hope that his parents are punishing him at home though. \n\nAll I know is that my son was in the wrong and I will not let him treat another person in that way, ever. Male or female.

      "scenario_description": "My brother might see and recognize this but it is what is is. \n\n\nMy mom passed away last summer. I (24M) was the only one of my siblings (F, M, M, all a couple of years older) interested in her car, so I handled everything with my sister since she was the authorized representative. I waited through probate, paid the fee, and had it titled, registered, and insured under my name this April. No one had issues at the time. I now drive that car (call it the yellow car).\n\nI’ve also had my own car (the green car) since 2021. Both cars are worth ~$3-4k.\n\nA couple months ago, one of my brothers asked to borrow my green car for the summer. I agreed but told him up front I might try to sell it and would need it back for that. He said fine.\n\nFast forward to early July: a coworker was interested in buying it. On July 9, I texted my brother that a buyer might be coming. No reply. I texted again on the 11th to say I’d need it Monday or Tuesday. Again, no reply.\n\nToday, I texted him I’d come get it, and he blew up—saying the siblings need to be involved because I “got Mom’s car for free” and shouldn’t be selling my own car. He also claimed he didn’t see my texts because he was at a music festival Fri-Sun… but my first texts were from the Tues and Thurs before that, and he still managed to post to Instagram.\n\nHe sent some texts insulting my character, calling me selfish and saying I’d ruin my relationship with him and my sister “over money.” When I pointed out I warned him from the start I might need my car back, he went off with:\n\n“I’m literally offering you money to use your car, can you not read? If you think I’m guilt tripping you then you’re actually [r-word]. You clearly only care about yourself, hope ruining this relationship is worth it. Don’t talk to me ever again.”\n\n(Also—he only mentioned possibly buying when we first talked 7 weeks ago, never responded about it again until today, after he was already insulting me.)\n\nI went and picked up my car from my other brother’s place (where brother in question is staying after quitting his job last year to travel). Found three empty weed pens in it—so apparently he was driving my car high.\n\nNow I’m planning to go low/no contact for a while and not let him borrow anything of mine again.\n\nAITA?",

And thanks for the support\n\nEdit 2 & small update: We're in the USA, and she was able to fix herself a plate if she wanted to. But usually she chooses not to, probably due to her work. Also I ate the fish for lunch because she wouldn't, also due to this rule I probably would've had to skip breakfast entirely",

      "scenario_description": "I (19F) have been home from college for about a month now. I live at home with my mom, her boyfriend, my two younger sisters (both 15F), and her boyfriend’s two sons (13M and 12M). I didn’t even know his kids were living here permanently until I got back for summer break. I don’t have a problem with them personally, we barely speak. The only thing is food in this house disappears constantly. It’s not that my mom and her boyfriend don’t buy groceries. They do. But no matter how much food is in the house, it’s gone in a day or two. My younger sister and “stepbrothers” I guess, eat all the time. They’ll eat a full breakfast, lunch, and dinner and then still go downstairs constantly throughout the day and night making snacks, extra meals, or just raiding the fridge. Like, I’m not exaggerating, sometimes they make ten different things between meals.\n\nEven with leftovers, I’ll come home and there’s nothing left. I’ve asked my mom about it, and she’ll say she told them to save me some, but they never do. It’s happened so many times that I just gave up. I started putting food aside before I leave the house, but even then, someone would eat it. So now I’ve started just DoorDashing my own food or cooking my own food and keeping it in my mini fridge from college. I stock it with groceries I buy with my own money and just cook for myself when I need to eat. I don’t touch the shared food anymore, and I don’t ask anyone to share mine.\n\nWhen my mom and her boyfriend are at work, and the fridge is empty and my siblings are hungry because they ate all the food in two days, I don't bat an eye because its not my fault or responsibility. The other day, my mom made a comment about how I “only think about myself” and I should “think about the house as a whole.” My sisters are playing a part in this, but majority of it is on her boyfriend's kids. Before I left for college and they didn't live here, food would last. I told that to my mom and she's like \"they're still growing\" and \"you're just being dramatic because you don't like them living here\". That's not the case at all. I get that maybe I'm wrong for door dashing or cooking food while they're hungry, but I’m also tired of being hungry and stressed in my own home. They don't think about me while they're eating my leftovers. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Ok before I start I have to mention that this was a year ago and we are still close friends even after all this, but I still feel guilty for this and just want to get it off my chest if I was wrong or not.\n\nSo my friend mostly always got along but there was this huge annoyance for me, he was always super late for everything and he always had pretty weak reasonings for why he was late. Like he would literally tell me that he would just be watching something or just wanted to finish working on a project, and he did this with no heads up. I'm not even a super punctual person but i still try to make it to something on an agreed time or at least at most a few minutes late, and let people know ahead of time if I would be late. I have tried communicating this to my friend that he should try to make things on time or at least give a heads up if he's not gonna be on time, but he kept arriving late consistently.\n\nSo one night I was starting to get really feed up with this behavior and this friend had just so happened to be literal HOURS late this time around. I kept messaging him on where he was and he just kept responding with something along the lines of \"I'll be there in a bit\". So I just kept waiting there until he shown up hours later. I'm truthfully not an angry person in the slightest but when I get mad, I really strongly lash out on someone, and this just so happened to be one of those times cause I was tired of just waiting with no communication on what's happening. I basically just yelled to him that I was fed up of waiting everytime we plan something at a set time and just wishing he could even just try to communicate these things cause he never did. And then after that he started crying with the most miserable voice I've ever heard and explained the whole situation and I felt terrible and offered to comfort him in this but he was justifiably mad after I lashed out at him in one of the worst moments in his life.\n\nAfter things settled he did finally make more of an effort to be on time for things and give a heads up when he wouldn't be on time and no we don't have to argue at all after that, but I still feel very guilty with the whole thing of lashing out at him after that whole situation and just want to know if it was reasonable or not.

      "scenario_description": "My (32M) family has been planning a big vacation for over a year. It's me, my wife, our two kids (5 and 7), my parents, and my sister \"Anna\" (29F). We decided to rent a huge, high-end beach house in a popular tourist spot for a week. The total cost for the house was about $7,000, which we agreed to split five ways between the adults (me, my wife, my parents, and Anna), so $1400 per person.\n\nAnna was excited and paid her share of the deposit ($700) last year. The final balance was due two months ago, and she paid that too. Everything was set.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, Anna started having severe abdominal pain. After a few doctor visits, she was diagnosed with a pretty serious condition that required surgery. The surgery was scheduled for last Thursday, right in the middle of our vacation week. Obviously, she couldn't come. She was really upset about it, crying on the phone about missing the trip and being worried about the surgery. We all told her not to worry and just focus on her health.\n\nHer surgery went well, and she's now recovering.\n\nThe vacation was great, but obviously, Anna wasn't there. Her empty room was a bit of a downer, but we made the best of it.\n\nHere's where I might be the AH. Yesterday, I called Anna to see how she was feeling. We were chatting, and I brought up the vacation finances. I told her that since the house was non-refundable and her spot was already paid for, we still considered that her \"share.\" I said something like, \"Hey, glad you're recovering! Just wanted to square up on the vacation stuff. Since we couldn't get a refund for your spot, we're all square on the $1400 for the house.\"\n\nHer answer was \"Are you serious? You want me to pay for a vacation I couldn't go on because I was in the hospital having surgery?\"\n\nI explained that it wasn't about wanting her to pay, it's that her share was already locked in. We all paid the same amount. It wouldn't be fair for the rest of us to have to absorb her cost just because she had a personal issue come up, even a medical one. I told her that's what travel insurance is for, and it wasn't my fault she didn't get any.\n\nShe got really emotional and started crying, saying that she can't believe I'd bring this up while she's in pain and can barely walk. She called me a heartless ghoul and hung up.\n\nNow my parents are calling me, saying I was incredibly insensitive and that the family should have just eaten the cost. My mom said she's your sister not a business partner. But I see it as a matter of principle. We all made a financial commitment. If my car had broken down on the way and I'd missed half the trip, I wouldn't expect a refund from everyone else.\n\nMy wife is on my side, saying it's fair, but my parents and now Anna are treating me like I'm some kind of monster. I was just trying to be fair and logical about the money.",

You don't seem to be a very principled character, you're a selfish. insensitive, arrogant, condescending AH.

      "scenario_description": "I have been sharing a flat with a friend for the last 3 years splitting all bills evenly, some were in his name and some in mine. When it came to moving out and cancelling all standing orders, I received a notice that I would be charged a £120 cancellation fee for the broadband as I was cancelling halfway through a two year contract. \n\nAt the time, me and my flatmate took out a two year contract in my name as it was a lot cheaper than a one year contract, but as we had recently renewed the tenancy on our flat for another year we agreed if we weren’t going to stay after the one year tenancy, we would take the internet wherever we moved to. Halfway through the year he told me he’d be moving in with his girlfriend, and decided to move out a couple of months before the tenancy finished on our apartment. Fast forward to now, I’m having to move into another flatshare as he has moved in with his girlfriend, which he did not inform me at the time of taking out the wifi contract, and I am having to pay an early cancellation fee on our broadband. He is claiming the fee is completely my fault as it is in my name and it is my responsibility to pay the full fee because i’m moving into a flatshare with already existing wifi, but at the time of signing the broadband contract he did not have any plans for the next year and did not inform me he’d be moving away to a different city. AITAH for asking him to pay half, or is he the asshole for refusing to pay?",

      "scenario_description": "TL;DR: Parents sold grandmas cabin they inherited to their next door neighbors son+investors at a steep discount, knowing it was really important to me and that I wanted to keep it in the family, didn't tell me they were selling it until it was under contract / in escrow, then were super dismissive of their actions being hurtful. AITA for uninviting them to my daughters birthday party because I couldn't be in the same room with them right now without being visibly upset and didn't want to take away from my daughters party?\n\nMy grandma died around 5 years ago and had a summer cabin that she and the family would spend time at. I would spend the entire summer there with her when I was a young kid, so I had a lot of memories there. Growing up I always heard about how someday it would be passed down to me, and I always had the impression it was grandmas intention was that it would stay in the family. I felt like she gave it to my parents, because my grandma thought my parents would try to keep it in the family.\n\nOn a call with my mom, she said in passing they were getting an escrow check tomorrow and stuff moved out since they sold the cabin. I was shocked. They mentioned they sold it to their next door neighbors son and had gotten about $380k. A real estate agent told them they were leaving $50-75k on the table and they shouldn't sell at that price, and looking at comps which were around $480k-650k, I would concur $380k for the cabin was a really (almost insulting) low price. IMHO it was sold at least $100k under market value.\n\nThey said they moved quick because my dad is having a major back surgery, and maintenance was too much... I have always been vocal that I wanted to figure something out and how important it was to me. When I asked my dad, did you really want to sell it, the answer was no he didn't, but he didn't want to have any more fights with my mom about spending money on the cabin.\n\nWhen I explained how much it hurt and felt like a betrayal that they didn't even involve me, or let me make a counter offer their only reaction was to dismiss my feelings and justify their actions. Knowing they gave the neighbors son such a good deal, when they have never been even 10% as generous to me or my brothers, over our entire lifetime, let alone a single transaction is tough. I didn't think that I could be in the same room with them right now without being visibly upset, and there was no way I could focus solely on my daughter/family for her birthday party with my parents there. The party was great btw, had friends and my daughter had a great time!\n\nSince my grandma gave the cabin to my parents, as far as I am concerned, they can do with the place as they wish. But the way they did it feels really fucked up and not OK. The cherry on top is it wasn't like they needed to sell, it was just convenient for them.\n\nBut it has me thinking... AITA for feeling hurt/betrayed about this? AITA for uninviting them from our daughters birthday party?",

      "scenario_description": "I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. \n\nIn the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. \n\nI am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. \n\nThey’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. \n\nYesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. \n\nI had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. \n\nMy kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. \n\nBut afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. \n\nSo AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",

      "scenario_description": "This was a family event with my(30M) long term gf's(30F) family - we've been dating for 13 years and living together for 7. Her family would describe her brother as extroverted, light hearted and well intentioned.\n\nThere were 12 people total at this event.\n\nMy girlfriend, let's call her G, has recently gotten a new car, from her job, and the insurance very specifically says only she is allowed to drive it, which makes G (and myself) anxious to let other people drive it, even me, who she would otherwise be more than happy to take the driver's seat since she's not comfortable driving.\n\nG's brother(32M), let's call him B, is the kind of person that enjoys having the attention of whatever group he's in, when we're hanging out and he shows up, the whole thing quickly turns into where is B going, what does B want to do, etc. This has not changed in the 13 years I've known this family.\n\nThere is a sibling bullying dynamic in that B messes with G any chance he gets, like they're 10 years old. The problem I have is that the parents don't do - and evidently never have done - anything about it, they just laugh and wave it off as typical sibling behaviour, further enabling it. A single fresh example: at this gathering, G arrived and complained to her father that, as she was driving there, B - in the front seat - kept messing with her, the car, pressing all the buttons and honking the horn. Their mother was in the car and obviously did nothing about it, and the father's response was something along the lines of \"you keep complaining about it you only give him more reason to do it\".\n\nSo right from the start of this gathering I was a bit miffed, once again, at this bullshit enabling that happens constantly.\n\nFast forward to after we ate, we were playing some board games, B comes over and asks for the car keys, G asks why does he need the keys, and their mother says \"he's just going to rest a little\" (we were at some picnic tables in a small park). G gives B the keys. A few minutes later we see B driving the car down the road. Everyone was just looking at it and smiling, like they always do \"haha, there he goes, what a goofball\". My line of thought is usually: this is infuriating but it's not my place to handle it, usually I mention it to G when we get home, in hopes she can have a conversation with her parents about it. Not this time, this time I lost it, I shouted at him to bring the car back, and started cussing in front of the kids, which G then started arguing with me about. Their father and I then start arguing about B, and I tell him (paraphrased) that B is an asshole and it's his responsibility as his parent and that he should be ashamed of B's behaviour. Naturally the father was upset, walked out of the game, and I walked out of the gathering.\n\nMy position on this family dynamic has been a pain point in me and G's relationship, and I wish I had the social skills to handle the whole thing a lot better, but tell me, AITA?\n\nEdit for posterity: I've had to clarify this a few times so clearly I didn't explain myself properly. When I argued with FIL, I didn't mean that he should be doing something about B taking the car, what I told him is that this is the result of poor parenting, and that this type of behaviour should have been dealt with long ago.",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nMy late husband died when my oldest daughter (Sofia) was 9 and my youngest daughter (Julie) was 2. Julie has zero memories of her biological dad. I started to date 4 years after his death and remarried 7 years later (Sofia was 16 and Julie was 9). Sofia wanted nothing to do with him and looking back was a dick to him. My husband (Jim) never tried to force Sofia to see him as a father figure, but Julie did see him as a father figure. She refers to him as Dad. Both girls have been to therapy, Sofia hated it and I actaully think it made the issue below worse. Julie like it and helped her overcome never knowing bio dad.\n\nThat was the main issue between Sofia and Julie, Sofia thought julie was abandoning and replaying their bio-dad.  Julie made it very clear that Jim is her dad and basically bio-dad doesn’t mean much to her since, she doesn’t remember him. Many fights and their relationship was strained. Therapy didnt help, separate and group were tried. \n\nIt got better when Sofia went off to college and they had space. Julie (24) is getting married. She announced this during dinner last Saturday and asked for Jim to give her away. Sofia did not take that well and started telling Julie that she was a horrible daughter and that she is replacing dad.\n\nThe announcement was ruined and Julie told her not to come to the wedding. I pulled Sofia aside and told her that she needs to apologize to her sister for her outburst, that she is way too old for this and it is time for her to grow the fuck up. That is fine that she doesn’t see jim as her father but get over that her sister does. \n\nShe was crying when I finished, told me it is my fault for getting remarried in the first place and had not contacted me since. I know she apologized to Julie but she won’t respond to any of my texts.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSameish question being asked, her is one of my comments answering it\n\n\"No, he never forced himself to be a father figure. Bio dad stayed very alive in memory after my wedding, he wasnt hidden. He still got mentions and story all the time, he was celebrated on his birthday and so on\n\nNo grave visiting because he is cremated and is on the fireplace.\"",

She's certainly old enough to recognize that their father is not even a distant memory to Julie. Julie is not \"replacing\" their dad, he never existed for her.   \nJim is the only man she has known as a father. Of course, she asked him to fulfill that role in her wedding.   \nIf Sophia can't show her sister a little grace then she should stay away.",

I thought it would be lighthearted stuff like, kiss someone, post a thirst trap, flirt with a guy at a party, maybe go on a date, simple and harmless things. Instead, they added things I think are just wild and outrageous. Like there are dares now for giving head in a car, hooking up in public, getting fingered at a party, sending nudes, filming a sex tape, even having a threesome, getting multiple hickeys from different people in one night. I’m the chill, more reserved one in the group. I don’t hook up much, I’m not judgmental. Everyone but me is taking this challenge so seriously. I made a comment the other day and said they’re gonna catch something or get caught up because these challenges are getting trashy. I didn’t say they were trashy, just that the dares themselves were. Now everyone’s acting like I’m slut shaming or trying to ruin the vibe. Even went as far as to say I'm jealous because I don't have any points yet. I just don’t feel comfortable with where it’s gone, and I think I should be allowed to say that without being seen as judgmental.",

I was shocked because I've never borrowed from her ever! So, it turns out that our aunt has taken her jewelry shopping and has asked her to pick out a necklace for me. She has jokingly asked the aunt if she was getting anything at all to which the aunt said \"No\". So, she chose an ugly necklace. Two weeks later, my aunt came to me and asked me to pick a necklace out for her which I thought would suit her. I picked a cute necklace with a small pink diamond pendant.\n\nAnd for Easter we gather in our grandparents house to celebrate the day. The aunt asked us to wrap the presents. We had already done so. Then when it was time for gift giving, she simply asked us to open the box we had wrapped by ourselves (which we thought was the other person's). Or if we wanted we could gift it to each other. I was so happy to get the cute necklace which I selected. But, my cousin wasn't. She simply demanded that I give her \"her rightful\" present (the cute necklace) and take the meh necklace. I refused and said that we were supposed to keep our own gifts because we spent time selecting it and aunt didn't wanna take risk and so she took us shopping and still made it a lovely surprise. And so, she's stuck with the ugly necklace and not me. But she argued and said that she doesn't find it ugly but wants to encourage gifting between \"family\". She wants me to be stuck with the ugly one and my other relatives who don't understand have sided with her. \n\n\nPlease help me. I'll quote your replies to my relatives. And if it's like above 50% supporting me, I'll have a solid point to hold onto. ",

      "scenario_description": "So basically I’m an international student studying in the US, but I’ve been back home (in my family home, not vacationing or traveling around) for the summer. \n\nDespite being home, I decided to register for some online summer classes at my university. However, it turned out the university's Canvas site (our learning platform) is blocked in my country by the university's IT department, so I relied on a VPN for a while to submit HW, until I had an exam approaching through Canvas which used lockdown software, which didn't work with VPNs, so I had to find an official solution. Earlier in the week of the exam I worked with my school’s IT department to get my IP address whitelisted so I could access it for the exam I had due on Sunday.\n\nEverything seemed fine. I tested Canvas on Saturday, submitted some HW, it worked perfectly. But on Sunday morning when I sat to take the exam, I found out I got blocked again. Turns out my IP address had changed, which caused me to get blocked again.\n\nTo explain: Most internet service provider's including mine assign what’s called a dynamic IP address to home networks, which means the address my connection uses to access the internet automatically changes every few days. I can’t control when or how often it changes, and I had no idea it had changed overnight, or that my school's IT department hadn't foreseen this issue and worked around it. Since my school's Canvas blocks all IPs from my country by default, once it changed, I was locked out again.\n\nI contacted IT right away, but they told me they couldn’t help until Monday, after the exam was due. I emailed my professor explaining the situation and asked for a 1-day extension under the circumstances.\n\nHer response was cold. She said she doesn’t allow extensions unless there are “serious extenuating circumstances,” and that this doesn’t count because I “chose to travel.” She also pointed out that IT is open on weekends and that I had until the end of business hours to resolve the issue with them, despite me clearly stating that they had already told me the issue would have to wait until Monday.\n\nI tried to explain that I’m not on some vacation sipping pina colada's forgetting about the exam until the last second, I’m home with my family, settled, and I had already taken steps earlier in the week to make sure this wouldn’t happen. But she brushed it off and said I’d get a zero if I didn’t resolve it before the deadline.\n\nI got in touch with IT again and they agreed that the professor was being unreasonable and excessively harsh, they decided they'd get in touch with her to explain the situation and get her to understand that these issues are out of my hands and that I made reasonable efforts to avoid any technical issues. \n\nI get that deadlines are important, but I really did everything I could. I tested the system, worked with IT in advance, and just got unlucky with a technical issue I couldn’t predict or control.\n\nSo… AITA for asking for a 1-day extension under these circumstances?",

      "scenario_description": "This is such a stupid thing to even talk about but whatever.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend \"Dan\" (M27) and I (F25) both work full time. Dan and his friends (4 guys, all late 20s) all work from home, and they like to meet up and hang out when they work. Great! Happy for them! They'll rotate between their houses, meeting up for lunch and kind of extending that into a post-work hangout.\n\nThe thing is, all of his friends live alone. Dan & I live together. One of my biggest pet peeves is having random people in my house when I get home from work. I hate it so much-- I just wanna take my shoes off and relax and I can't do that if there's four dudes that I don't really know in my living room and kitchen.\n\nI spoke to Dan about potentially removing our house from the rotation, or at least taking his friends out around the time I get home. He said that was controlling, which maybe it is. He also said it wouldn't be fair for them to host every week and for him to just skate by.\n\nI get that! I do! But I feel like I'm a variable that isn't being accounted for here. Honestly I'm conflicted here, so I figured I'd ask: am I an asshole for not wanting my boyfriend's friends over when I get home?\n\nEDIT for more info, from a couple questions (& comments) I've seen:\n\n- The guys come over once a week usually. Sometimes twice a week. They come over at lunchtime (noon ish), and they're there until usually 7PM or so. I get home at 5:30 ish.\n\n- I do not want or expect my bf to stop hanging out with his friends, nor am I expecting him to break up with me for this. I didn't lecture or yell at him or anything, we had a regular conversation about this.\n\n- The guys themselves are not creepy or weird or anything. I'm just tired after work and I like being able to unwind, and part of that (for me at least) is the comfort of knowing I don't have guests around.\n\n- I can't avoid them that much-- our apartment is an open floor plan & the only bathroom is in our bedroom, so there's always *some* level of interaction.",

I went to an international school where almost everyone went on to study in the States. I applied to universities in the US and UK, got a few admits, and was starting to plan my next steps.\n\nRight as everything was coming together, my dad pulled the rug out from under me.\n\nOut of nowhere, he decided I wouldn’t be going abroad — and instead, I’d be going back to our home country. He sent out my applications himself, got me admitted to one of the top engineering schools there, and just told me that’s where I’d be going. End of discussion.\n\nThe thing is I never wanted to study engineering. I told him *so many times*, but it didn’t matter. His reasoning was that I needed to “get in touch with my roots.” For context, I’m a third culture kid — spent my entire life abroad, grew up in a different country, and studied in a predominantly American system. His decision felt like exile.\n\nThose four years of university were the worst years of my life. I was stuck in a country I didn’t feel at home in, studying something I had no interest in. I was numb the whole time, and I’ve spent years trying to block it all out. It still fucks me up to this day. My parents know how I feel, but they believe I should be “grateful” to have graduated from such a prestigious university.\n\nAfter graduating, COVID hit. I was stuck with a degree I didn’t want and no idea what to do. Eventually, I decided I would pursue a Master’s, but this time on my terms. Fast forward three years: I’ve built a life I love, I live in a great country, I have a job I actually care about, and I’m happy.\n\nBut now my brother is going to university in the US — the exact path I wanted to take. He said he wanted to study there, and they supported him without hesitation. And I’m finding it impossible to process.\n\nI feel so fucking angry. I feel like I was robbed of a future I could’ve had. Every time someone brings up his college plans, I feel like I’m choking. And so I stay out of family discussions. My parents have noticed, and when I tried to explain why, they called me jealous, fake, and ungrateful. They told me I have no right to be upset since “everything worked out in the end.” They said, I should be supportive and present during this important phase in my brother's life.\n\nBut it’s true, I am jealous. Not because I don’t want my brother to have this opportunity — I do. I’m glad he gets to live out his dream. But I’m angry that I didn’t get the same chance. That I was given no choice. I just resent my parents, and the unfairness of it all. And so I stay away.\n\nQuestion is: AITA for still being upset about this, even though things have worked out for me now?\n\n ",
