      "scenario_description": "My girlfriend of 1 year and I have a loving and healthy relationship. The woman of my dreams. We met in my home province and she is from another province (12 hour drive to her hometown). I have attended Christmas/Holiday season in her hometown for two weeks, and was just there for over a week this month. Both times using some of my vacation time. \n\nThe wedding is in September and my girlfriend is the maid of honour. She’s busy for about two days straight and I’m expected to stay/hang out with people I’ve never met (that’s fine tbh) or by myself. But she wants to go for over a week to see family, recuperate from the long drive, etc. The problem is that I teach two university courses in the fall and will be starting a new research position. I’ve had to spend a ton of money on her, travel, moving, dates, gifts for defending her dissertation, etc, am feeling it, and want to settle in September.  I’ve done a lot for her and I told her I can’t see myself being able to go to this wedding, but will 100% take time to attend her graduation in the same province/area in October, and go to her home for this years Holiday in December. \n\nI’ve met the bride to be and her fiancé once for an hour. I am stressed to the max and tried explaining that being put in this position adds a lot onto me. She is upset, but then won’t talk to me about it and goes into another room. \n\nI want some outside perspective. I feel like a jerk but had to put my foot down and do what’s best for me…given that I have primarily done as much as I can for her at this point in the relationship. \n\nSo am I the asshole for saying I can’t go to this wedding?",

And your committed to spend time for other more directly personal occasions for her. You have professional obligations and financial constraints that make it pretty impossible for you to take time to be with her in September.\n\nThe woman of your dreams is sooo lovely that she\n\n1. Has no limit on what she expects you to expend so that you can be with her for every single thing in her life that takes place in her home province.\n\n2. Makes on effort to find ways to minimize how much she wants you to sacrifice. In fact she extends the time so that she can do things she wants to do, at an enjoyable, leisurely pace that suits her.\n\n3. Doesn't care that she will be otherwise occupied and leaving you to twiddle your thumbs just so she can enjoy the fact that you in the vicinity.\n\n4. Doesn't seem to give a hoot or acknowledge that you have professional responsibilities and commitments at that particular time.\n\nAnd if you try to tell her about your constraints and challenges, her response is to refuse to talk to you and walk away.\n\nShe sounds truly lovely. /s \n\nWe all have a crystal clear view of just how much your own other obligations and (financial/other) well-being matter to her.",

      "scenario_description": "I (24F) live in an apartment building and have a neighbor, Kyah (27F), who’s friendly but a bit careless. Over the past six months, Kyah’s borrowed several things from me tools, a ladder, even my Wi-Fi password when her internet was down. I didn’t mind at first, but she’s terrible about returning stuff. My screwdriver set is still missing, she kept my ladder for weeks until I asked for it back, and she used my Wi-Fi for a month without offering to chip in for the bill. Each time, I’ve been polite and let it slide, thinking she’d get better about it. Last weekend, I ran into Kyah at the grocery store. She was at the checkout with a cart full of stuff but realized she’d forgotten her wallet. She asked if I could cover her $85 bill, promising to pay me back that evening. I hesitated because of her track record with my stuff and because I’m on a tight budget myself. I told her I could spot her $20 for essentials but couldn’t cover the whole bill, especially since it included things like expensive snacks and beer. She got frustrated, saying I was unneighborly and that she’d have done the same for me. She ended up leaving most of her items behind and only buying what she could with the cash she found in her pocket. Since then, Kyah’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and another neighbor said Kyah called me stingy. I feel bad because I know forgetting a wallet is stressful, and maybe I could’ve helped more since we’re neighbors. But I also feel like her pattern of borrowing without reciprocating made me wary. \n\nAITA for not covering her full grocery bill?",

Wife says I'm being too picky about manners so I just eat before or after them. Am I the asshole here ? I'm continuing on being nice and welcoming and i think it's a fair compromise. ",

But telling you to \"suck it up\" is NOT that; it's not even close to kind.\n\nTell your wife that she can collaborate with you to possibly identify a better way to handle things, but she needs to accept the premise that this sound is more than you can tolerate on a daily basis.\n\nIf not, your solution is not disruptive and the best idea on the table.\n\nI hope some of the commenters here can offer some great ideas based on their personal experience.",

      "scenario_description": "I (F25) am a bridesmaid in the wedding of a good friend (F27) this fall. She had us all plan to be free the first weekend of August for her bachelorette party, promising we’d do something fun but lower cost (relative to the crazy destination bachelorettes people plan these days). This weekend, she and her maid of honor sent out what they decided on for the trip, which was to spend the night at an indoor waterpark resort. They wanted us 12 girls to get 6 rooms (2 in each) for one night, spending two days there total.\n\nAs soon as I saw the message in the groupchat, I knew the trip wouldn’t be fun for me due to my size. I am about 5’7” and 270 pounds, and the maximum weight for a single rider on the majority of slides is 250. There are a few 300 pound maximums, or 2-person rides with 400 pound maximums, but the idea of standing in my bathing suit, being weighed to make sure I can go, makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI know I’m overweight and need to lose some, but insecurity isn’t the main thing holding me back. I’d happily go on a beach vacation and rock a bathing suit the whole time. It’s the combination of the bathing suit, weigh-ins, and fact that I am too big to participate in many of the rides that makes it seem not fun to me. Because I couldn’t do the same things as all the other girls, (there are a few heavier girls in the party, but I’m by far the biggest and I think the only one who exceeds 250 pounds), I think it would leave me feeling bad all weekend instead of upbeat and excited for the bride.\n\nI told my friend politely that I didn’t think I would be attending, and she got very upset, saying that she asked us to reserve the weekend months in advance and that she worked hard to keep costs down. I told her that I agree and appreciate all of that, but that I don’t think I’d be a ton of fun on this particular trip. She pushed and when I elaborated, she said that I could float in the lazy river/hot tub or swim in a standard pool or drink at the bar while the other girls rode slides and that I shouldn’t let my weight hold me back, especially from something so important to her. I still feel like it would be uncomfortable and a waste of money for me, as I wouldn’t truly be able to have the same experience. WIBTA for not going?",

The bride and MOH were considerate in some ways, but they failed to ask/ her a sense of what the group would enjoy doing - as a group.\n\nI was going to give a straight n-t-a, but then I realized that you are making a somewhat similar mistake as your good friend: You came up with your solution without having a conversation to collaboratively problem solve first.\n\nSo I suggest you do that before deciding whether you should go or not.\n\nThe two main teasons you don’t want to go are (1) getting weighed (don’t blame you at all!) and (2) being off on yiur own while the group is having collective fun on the lower weight limit features. It would be nice if the group got ti have input on the plan, but that ship has sailed as far as being at the waterpark. So the question is whether you can be with the others and not have to deal with being weighed.\n\nBTW, as another similarly overweight woman, I’m so glad you are comfortable wearing a bathing suit. Me too!\n\nCan you see if any of these things (that I think might make going more palatable for you) are/ can be part of the weekend?\n\n1. Not getting weighed\n\nI imagine they only weigh a person if there is a concern that person is over the limit. It would be off-putting for anyone of any weight to be weighed before getting in a ride. So I have to believe this place doesn’t ask anyone to check their weight unless they appear close to the limit.\n\nThat would mean there is definitely no need to be weighed on the rides with the higher limits. [There are weights limits for normal land park rides; I have never been weight checked, even when I may have looked close to the limit.]\n\nIs it possible the likelihood of being weighed is lower than you think?\n\n2. Being with the group\n\nThat also means some of your group who are on the heavier side would also tend to prefer the same rides as you. Have you checked with any of those bridesmaids to see what rides they plan to enjoy?\n\nThe group may choose/plan to spend more time doing things like the lazy river or chatting and enjoying food/drinks without hours of going in the rides at all. The bride and MOH may have planned some non-ride activities for the group.\n\nCan you get a sense of what most people plan to do?\n\nIs it possible you may be in good company more than you imagine?\n\nI do encourage you to try to get a sense of those things before deciding the weekend would be as isolating and embarrassing as you currently imagine.\n\nI think mild mistakes don’t make anyone an AH. So far, I don’t think anyone has pushed things into AH territory.\n\nNAH.",

      "scenario_description": "\n\nSo I (34 f) have a little sister (28 f) that needed somewhere to go to get her and her 3 small kids away from her abusive boyfriend. My wife and I had just moved across the country, back to my hometown, to be closer to the family literally about two weeks prior to us giving her somewhere safe to stay. Shortly after that she made up a story about taking the kids camping with her two best friends. Later, we find out (from the kids) that they were actually with said ex boyfriend. I sat her down and explained to her that I knew the truth and that I knew she lied to me. She altered the story slightly to include him saying he “just showed up” yet none of the other friends were even there😐\n\nFast forward to this weekend and my wife and I are out of town. Sister is at the housing watching the dogs so she reaches out and says her and her best friend are taking a trip to Colorado. Cool. I tell her to have so much fun. We converse a bit about Colorado over the weekend and then I went to text her again and her location popped up (she had said a few days before that she was setting up Siri and it must have messed up her location settings when I asked why her location was off). Her location said she was in Arkansas (which she used to take a lot of trips to when she was dating the ex boyfriend) so I straight up ask her “hey why are you in Arkansas?” And she replies saying they changed the plan due to money and I said “Is that true? Cause I know you went to AR with *ex boyfriend” all the time and really hope you’re not lying to me again”. She went on to assure me she was telling the truth even adding in more detail about her friend and what they did.\n\nThat was yesterday. I got an unrelated call today from one of my best friends. We talked about things in our lives going on since I’d been out of state and then she asks if my sister was dating that guy again. I ask her why she’d ask and she says because they just went on a trip together and she saw it on facebook. He posted multiple pictures and even named the exact place my sister had claimed to be with her friend. \n\nI set a boundary, after the first lie, that if she wanted to live with us then she couldn’t also be with him. Now, if she wants to go date that loser then it’s her life and she absolutely can…just not while living with us. Also, that she can’t lie to me. We are trusting her with our home, our pets, and everything that comes with it. It’s supposed to be our safe space and this guy is OFF THE RAILS with alcohol, drugs, and violence. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to kick her out for lying to me and hanging out with him?",

I feel guilty just leaving him after he comes to a family party with me to spend the rest of the weekend with my friends while he goes home alone. \nClaire said that my fiance will be fine for 1 night and we’re getting married and we’ll have the rest of our lives together and that I’m allowed to do things without him.  \nThis kinda made me sad because my fiance is my best friend and it didn’t occur to me that this was a girls only trip and I just want my fiance to come with me.\n\nClaire and Leah keep asking if I’ll leave this family party early and that doesn’t sit right with me. Family time it’s important especially since there have been several deaths and people are getting older. This will be the first time my fiance meets my extended family. \n\nI asked a few days later if there is something about my fiance they don’t like since this is not the first time there has been pushback on wanting to invite him to things.\n\nThey said they don’t have a problem with him but they barely get to see me and they want to only see me when we hangout. They did admit though that they didn’t like when we hangout if they start to get too “handsy” and rough with me, my fiance will step in between and stop them and they didn’t like this. I honestly didn’t recall this but can see him do this because I’ve told him how overstimulated I’ve felt after hanging out with Claire and Leah. I feel like they are just trying to push my easily pushed buttons. \n\nI bought my first house a year ago last month and Claire has been to my house once and Leah twice. I live 30 minutes from them and have made the drive to their houses several times and even drive through their city on my way to work everyday. It seems like pulling teeth to get them to come over. I was so excited when buying a house that we would have a space to hangout since our home situations weren’t hangout friendly but they have no inclination to come. Now they expect me to drive three hours to Claires family’s lake house for the weekend and to leave my family’s party early. AITAH if I cancelled going and told them why? ",

As far as I can tell\n\n(1) you are not cancelling the weekend; what you don't say but are asking is if it's OK to decline the invite. It sounds like Claire decided THIS was the weekend to invite you and Leah. They are both fine with it.\n\nHas it occurred to you to simply say, \"I can't make it that weekend; would another date work for the both of you?\"\n\n(2) You have pre-existing commitments, but are trying to say yes to everyone AND impose on others in order to make that happen. You can't expect your girl friends to want a guy to join the weekend. You can't expect your bf to hang out with your family while you go off with your gf.\n\nNOR can you expect your bf to (1) cut his visit with your family short because Leah decides to invite you for the same weekend and you can't tell anyone 'no' (2) tack on a THREE hour drive, each way, on top of a family visit, or (3) hang out uncomfortably with a trio that are supposed to be on 'girl's weekend'. That's not what he signed up for when he agreed to visit your family.\n\nYou and your friends have other issues that are spilling over - maybe you and your bf are a bit to clingy (maybe YOU are too clingy) and can't maintain your own relationships without your partner.\n\nYour friends may be selfish, lazy, or have some issue coming to see you. Have no idea. Those are things you and your friends need to work out.\n\nBut for this specific weekend's planning, just accept that you have a prior commitment. You cannot join your friends at the lake house the same weekend. Period.\n\nYou and your friends seem to be ESH for how you are interacting. You are N-T-A for declining the invite.",

I’ve had my fair share of times where I’ve been pretty unpleasant to them as a result but today I really lost it. \n\nThis guy rang my doorbell, setting off the kids and the dogs per usual. I go outside and he immediately starts going into his canned sales shit. I stop him to ask if he saw the sign and he says “yeah but I saw-“ followed by a weak ass excuse. I cut him off and said, so you chose to ignore the sign? And he just kept trying with the sales shit. I told him listen man, I  have kids and dogs etc and don’t appreciate it when people ignore the sign. Then he has the audacity to tell me I should put that on a sign and put it on my front door.\n\nI basically told him to fuck off and just went inside. He was clearly surprise how pissed I was, but I’m so tired of these guys. \n\nAs a side note, I actually had a sign that explained I had kids napping hanging from my door knocker a while ago, guess what happened to it? It was broken by a salesman using the knocker.",

      "scenario_description": "I had a friend come visit from out of town for a long weekend. We've been friend over 20 years,  and I was excited to see her.\n\nShe's had cats in the past, but married someone who is highly allergic to almost anything with fur, so she hasn't had any furred pets in many years (she has some reptiles). I have nurmerous cats, and she was also excited to get a weekend of kitties.\n\nHowever, it became clear very quickly that she doesn't live with cats. Leaving food unattended, putting cups on the edge of the coffee table/counter, etc, made it a very messy weekend. But whatever, right?\n\nThen there was the dental floss.\n\nFor context here, one of my cats ate a string he pulled out of a rug several months ago, and I paid THOUSANDS to save him. Like, he should have died - not only was it a very long string, but he had numerous post-op complications. But he is my baby, and it was money well spent to me. My cat learned exactly nothing from the experience - he still LOVES string and hair ties, and I am hypervigilant about such things being left out where he can access them.\n\nI told my friend she CANNOT throw dental floss in the bathroom trash - it has to go in the kitchen trash. The bathroom trash had a lid, but this cat is very smart and very determined. And in the event the lid doesn't get closed, it's essentially leaving string right at cat-height.\n\nWell, she didn't get the (very direct, not even a hint) hint. I kept finding floss in the bathroom trash, and twice I found it just laying on the counter, waiting to be swallowed. The first couple times, I tried to gently remind her. Then I directly told her again. When I found floss, yet again, just laying on the counter, I told her she needed to hand over her floss. I have the little floss picks she can use, but I cannot have long strings just being left around the house willy nilly. I cannot afford to have another major emergency vet surgery. I was not rude about it, and I did not yell or anything, but it was just too big a risk to keep allowing her to leave it lying about. \n\nShe complied, but after she went home her husband called me and said I was being totally put of line and treating her like a child, and that I should be more concerned with teaching my cat not to eat string. I do sort of see his point, but the reality is I tried to remind her not to do it, and it wasn't sticking. It's literally  a safety issue in my home - one that could mean life or death. If she couldn't manage to dispose of floss in the kitchen, then my only choice to protect my dumb ass cat is to remove the dangerous item. There is no \"teaching\" a cat to not use their insticts, and hunting/eating things is instinct.\n\nAITA here? I feel like no, but the way her husband acted, I'm now not totally sure.\n\n(And yes, I gave her floss back before she left. I'm not a floss thief)",

I get along well enough with her new husband, he's a cool guy in general, treats me and my mother well. He also has a 13 year old daughter from a previous relationship, as he's been married and divorced his ex. They have a 50/50 custody split of their daughter. \n\nDuring the wedding on Saturday, everyone had fun, I even shed some tears of joy for my mom. But Sunday, something shifted. My cousin asked if I am going to call my mom's new husband dad. I obviously said no. I already had a dad and was a fully grown woman by the time he came into my mother's life. \n\nAfter that comment, my mother and her sister pulled me aside, and started yelling at me to stop bringing up my father in front of her new husband because... he's jealous? Of a dead man? His ex is alive and they see each other every other weekend to pass the kid but he's jealous of a dead man? I basically told them to get off me. That I do not do it deliberately but my father had been my father for 20 years and naturally I bring him up sometimes in passing. Especially to my younger cousin who was only 7 when my dad passed away and barely remembers him.\n\nMy aunt went into a whole tangent how \"my dad was important to me but is not important to anybody else anymore and I should let go and move on instead of talking about him because everyone else is.\" That, in turn, made me cry and I didn't speak to either of them for the rest of the day.\n\nAITA for bringing up my dad sometimes? Is it reasonable of my mother's husband to be jealous of a literal corpse..?",

FALSE. Or may have never liked your father. What she said about your dad was MEAN. Or she may think your mom could easily lose her new husband if he feels there is even a hint of a rival. Inappropriately INSECURE on behalf of your mom.\n\nMaybe your mom has some insecurities of her own or is being influenced by her sister.\n\nKeep a good distance from your aunt and cousin for a good while. And if any of them raise the issue again, shut it down calmly and with certainty that they are wrong and being small minded and cruel.\n\nIf you feel comfortable doing so, maybe have a private conversation with your mom’s new husband. Tell him you would like the two of you to discuss how you two relate to each other. Know without a doubt that you have every right to explain to him your perspective and preferences - even more than he does.\n\nYou may find that his views and wants are perfectly reasonable, or reasonable but he has a few sensitivities, or more than you can or want to agree to. Then you have a better understanding of how to interact with him going forward.",

      "scenario_description": "\nI (16M) feel somewhat bad for how I responded to my mother (41F) telling me I had such a bad attitude. Now before I explain further, my mother and I recently moved houses, one with a basement. Her room is in the basement and mine is upstairs. Just today alone she has called me down 10 times to grab her various things (Drinks, dog food, a snack, etc.), that she could’ve grabbed five minutes prior to coming up. Now once or twice I can understand, people forget things every so often. I finally started getting more annoyed when she called me down to her room to grab something off of her nightstand and hand it to her, the nightstand that is less than five feet away from her. My mother is in no way handicapped or disabled, her excuse for it was “I can’t get out of the chair I’m stuck.” But right as I left the room she got up and used the bathroom. She asked me why I had such an attitude since we moved in, I told her the truth, “You just keep calling me downstairs” I didn’t yell it or anything either, I was talking at my normal voice level and everything, she proceeded to get mad at me for getting annoyed because in her own words, “I don’t ask you for much”, Now I feel bad because she keeps making me think that my feelings are… invalid? (For lack of another word.) I know I’m fortunate for a mother who loves me and cares for me, and I know she worked really hard to get us in a nice house too, but that doesn’t mean I can’t be annoyed at her because of her own laziness, so… AITAH? \n\nEdit: Sorry mom if you see this, I know you know I have a Reddit account but I just needed to vent for a sec.\n\nEdit 2: I really wasn’t expecting so many people to agree with me, so thank you for your advice I really appreciate everyone who commented, I will make sure to try and use some of your suggestions. Again thank you.",

      "scenario_description": "Before anything, I'd like to say that english isnt my first language, so there may be sentence structures here that seem off— partly due to my frustration— so I would just like to apologize in advance. Thank you.\n\nI recently turned 18, and on my birthday, my grandmother threw w small celebration for me. I invited my friends over, thought most of the guests were my family and close cousins. I'd also like to mention that I'm not very close with my mother. At all. She's remarried and I have a half-sibling, who I used to be close with as a child but since they left me with my grandmother, I grew apart from. My half-sister, who I'll call Jamie (14f) used to be such a sweet little girl. I hardly recognize her anymore as my mom has turned her into this spoiled brat. From what I've been told, Jamie was caught using vapes in school, as well as getting into a lot of trouble. It's also worth mentioning that while they left me with my grandmother, they moved to the city and lived an unbothered life without me.\n\nSo, my mom and Jamie arrive at the party (that my grandmother threw, id also like to very much emphasize that ONLY my grandmother threw this party for me. My mother did not contribute anything whatsoever) and Jamie hands me a gift. It was a plushie of a duck which I found really cute. However, my mother started snooping around my gifts the entire night, not even just staring at the wrappers, she was full on opening them in front while everyone was eating, chatting. \n\nAt the end of the night, I saw her open a bottle of perfume that a close friend got for me, it wasn't anything high end, but it was special enough for me because a friend gave it to me. I saw my mother showing it to Jamie, before stuffing it into her bag (Jamie, not my mother). I confront her about it, ask her why she's taking my perfume. She says she and jamie both like the perfume and they'd like to take this in exchange for the gift they brought me. I didn't want to make a scene so I pulled them outside and talked to them that way. I tried to remain calm, I really did, but Jamie was being so dismissive, telling me that it was just a perfume and I should just let her and mom take it so the conversation doesn't drag on. I didn't want to deal with it any further so I took the perfume from their hands, took all of the other gifts and placed them upstairs into my grandmothers room. I went back downstairs and I was told they had already left.\n\nAfter the party, I received a few messages from my mother, telling me that she didn't raise me to be so ungrateful that I can't even give up a bottle of perfume. I haven't responded either, nor did I tell my grandmother what really happened yesterday. My mom and Jamie are both obviously so upset with me, so I guess its up to you now, people of reddit, to convince me: Am I the asshole?",

I just messaged him that his stuff is ready to go and he needs to leave. I called his job and he didn’t even go to work today, AGAIN. I’d be lying if i said this was my last straw because i’ve been done with his cr*p for a while now. Thanks everyone for the support and love! Now i can finally live in peace again. \n\n\n\n\nHello Redditors, As the title suggests, i’m kicking my boyfriends brother out today. For context, I, 22F, and my boyfriend, 24M, have been together for 4 years. We have lived together for 3. My boyfriend, let’s call him O, has allowed his brother 26M, let’s call him G, to live with us for the past 3 months. G has a notorious past of living with multiple people, including his sisters, and eventually being kicked out. G is unsanitary, unhygienic and sloppy. Above all that he is very ungrateful. These past three months I had to clean up his mess, cook dinner, do his laundry, and i can’t even get a thank you. Me and my boyfriend O went on vacation to Spain last week, and when we came back home on saturday our house was a full blown mess. My mom and his aunt came over to check on our pets and the house every other day and it was messy every time, my pets didn’t have any food or water. We were livid. Now here’s the thing: my boyfriend O is very soft and kind in nature. He tried to have a talk with his brother G about his behavior. As i had guessed, this talk didn’t yield anything. We have talked with G over and over, he has debts up to 20k. I’m the complete opposite and i’m fed up, to word it lightly. I’m planning on packing his stuff this afternoon, locking the front door (because G has a key) and texting him, telling him his stuff is packed and ready to go. He still owes my boyfriend around €500 for rent and consumption. I’m afraid my boyfriend won’t receive his money. Overall this is a complicated and very frustrating situation and i’m at my wits end with this guy. He also has lied about so many things. He has pretended to leave for work and ends up not going. He lies about his debts. My boyfriend works shifts, and 2 days ago his brother brought in a girl to our home without telling us. So, AITA for kicking his brother out because my boyfriend doesn’t dare?",

You may want to discuss this with your boyfriend. Ask him to consider counseling to get fresh perspective, to understand how enabling his brother impacts you and others, and to develop skills in setting and upholding boundaries. The two of you will need to work on getting on the same page for how to handle his brother and others like him that may be in your lives.",
