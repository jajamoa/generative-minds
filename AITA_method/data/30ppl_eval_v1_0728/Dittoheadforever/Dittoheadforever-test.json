      "scenario_description": "Context: Me and 6 other friends went on a beach trip. The plan was to spend 2 days. We had booked a hotel for one night($1222) for which our friend said we could pay him back later. I paid for a rental van which we took there($571) which I also said everyone could pay us back later. \n\nThe first day everyone went to the beach and was satisfied. The second day, 4 people in the group were not trying to go on the sand. Instead, they wanted to walk around the city around the beach. (For context this is Virginia Beach). Me, and 2 other people in the group wanted to go in the water. We brought the keys to the rental van with us since we were the only ones with licenses. We had planned to leave the beach by 7pm so 2 people in the non-beach going group could go to work the next day, while allowing us to fulfill our rental van dropoff for 2:30AM\n\nWhile me and my 2 friends were in the water, the non-beach going group called us 5 times claiming that they wanted to leave early.(It was 4:57) and we didn't see the calls until we got out at 5:43. They said they were so exhausted that they sat and waited in a Wendy's for 3 hours. Me and the beach-going friends still wanted to get food. So we got the food and then we went to pick them up and go back home(This was 7 on the dot). My friend is giving me the silent treatment. Am I the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "Okay, so I recently talked to my mom about feeling like I shouldn’t have to clean the house every day, and that my family should be able to clean some things up on their own. This made her surprisingly upset— surprisingly because this conversation was me trying to problem solve how we could make our house less of a daily problem, things like throwing away your own trash, washing your dish off once you use it, putting your towels in the laundry basket, etc... SIMPLE things that everyone should do as I don't really think it's fair I'm spending my entire summer cleaning up other people's messes. \nBoth of my parents work from 7am-4pm EST, so my mom asks me to clean while they’re gone. This isn’t a problem considering I don’t have a job right now, and I live under their roof. Doing laundry, sweeping, mopping, vacuuming, even painting the kitchen walls, I'll do it. I think my problem is that I get tired of people creating a mess for me to clean every day when I'd like to have some of the summer to myself, as well. Leaving food around on plates, dirty towels on the bathroom floor, piss on the toilet seat, crumbs on the stove— things I really, really think should be easy to handle quickly and easily instead of having me make my rounds. I know these things are small, but I get yelled at and called lazy when I don't clean these things up. \n\nSo... AITA??? I really don't know.\n\nFAQ??: \nTook me awhile to figure out how to edit this, but important details I've been asked.\n1.) I'm 17, and going into my senior year.\n2.) My brother is 12, my only sibling, and doesn't help as my parents don't discipline him for these things. \n3.) I take care of everything in the house while my parents work, including reminding my brother to take care of himself, cooking, and making sure our dogs are good during the day. \n4.) I am actively trying to get a summer job, but live in a small town where most things are locally owned, out of my way, or aren't willing to hire more people because they're locally owned. My options are pretty slim. I've been trying to sell some things like old clothes online to have some money in my pocket, which is as close as I am currently to being employed. ",

I’m okay with firing ranges, since dad always wanted me to become a police. (Which is not what I aspire to be), but today—I declined his offer. Dad said it costs 2000 php (which is 35 USD) for the bullets and gun which is offered by the place and it’s pretty legit—so he said we can use MY money because he’ll repay me soon anyways. Sure, it might be fun if I did want to go. But for some reason, I didn’t want to bond. I don’t know and I feel guilty for declining him. I just answered: “I don’t want to”, or “no.” When they (both my parents) said “Come on, dress up. Let’s go.” I feel like I’m being selfish and a killjoy. I couldn’t even reason why I didn’t want to go—I just didn’t feel like it. I felt overwhelmed having to explain why. **Why?** I don’t know. I can’t explain. I feel like I’m obligated to go. Because after all that talk and our small argument, my dad said: “From now on, I don’t want you saying no. It’s just bonding.” And my mom sided with him and said “yeah, it’s just bonding.” It didn’t help my case. Now, maybe I’m just genuinely lacking explanation why I was behaving like that. But, I genuinely did NOT want to go. You know that feeling when your friends want to hangout but for some reason you don’t want to? That’s how I felt. I had no reason or argument why. But I felt like I’m disappointing my parents with their daughter lacking cooperation and understanding that they just want to bond. \n\nSide note: ((Sorry for bad english and bad grammar. I just need to get this out.))",

      "post_title": "AITA for not adequately cleaning up after my dogs? (according to a neighbor)",
      "scenario_description": "So I, 30 f, have 2 dogs. A 1 year old Husky and a 3 year old Bully mix. I live in an apartment complex. Im on the ground floor and right off my porch is a sidewalk and then on the other side of the side walk is a large area of grass. Usually 3 times a day I take the husky outside, they take 5-10 minutes depending on how distracted they get, to go potty and i bag up the waste. I tie up the baggy and put that baggy inside a grocery bag and tie that off as well. Then i leave the bag a few feet away from the side walk (in the grass) right outside my door and swap the husky for the bully mix. They usually take 2-3 minutes to do their business then i bag up the waste, put that baggy in the same grocery bag, and put the dog in the apartment before shuffling across the complex to throw the grocery bag away in the closest dumpster. (its all the way across the complex so it takes me like 2 minutes there and 2 minutes back)\n\nNow, i used to walk each bag over to the dumpster with the dog coming with me, but due to issues with chronic pain, dizzy spells, extreme fatigue, and fainting spells all becoming really severe over the last 4 months, all movement is really agonizing. its central to my hips and back so I've cut it to just 1 trip because it honestly is draining to make the short walk to the dumpster.\n\nI dont usually take the dogs out together because the Husky goes into play mode and will NOT go potty because they are busy jumping all over my bully. Its just chaos.\n\nA neighbor recently got after me for not immediately walking the waste to the dumpster after she watched me take my dogs out from a few buildings down. No one else has ever had an issue with how i handle things and honestly i think this neighbor just hates me over a separate issue (i refused to give her my empty aluminum cans) but she complained to the office. The leasing office spoke to me and after i explained, they said it was fine.\n\nBefore anyone worries for my babies: My friend and his brother take my dogs on their run with them 4 times a week in the morning to help me out since i cant do it right now. The other 3 days a week i take them to daycare for about 5 hours in the morning so they can run around and play in the pool there. Every day in the evening I take them to an off leash dog park and we play fetch for an hour-hour and a half. I may be in constant pain but they are my priority and i will always make sure they have the exercise and mental stimulation they need.\n\nPart of me thinks im not in the wrong here but I'm an anxious introvert who hates upsetting people so i feel guilty that maybe others might see me bagging poo and be grossed out that im leaving it there, even if its just for a few minutes. Plus im already super frustrated with my limited mobility so Ive been getting really angry at myself for not being able to do small things, so it might just be that talking. The opinions of a stranger or 2 would be nice.\n\nSo, AITA here?",

She (34F) knows this. She recently got pregnant, and as you know pregnant women should limit their intereaction with litter. We get along fairly well I would say. She and her bf (lives 40mins away) lightheartedly said that \"It's your (my) responsibility to clean the kitty litter now\". We live a block away from each other and I am excited about the baby and want to help and provide support as best as I can, just not with that. I feel like a shitty sister, but I also don't want to do it. AITA?\n\nUpdate -\nWow! I did not expect this many responses. Thank you everyone. To answer similar questions in the thread:\n1. This is a fairly new relationship (between sis and her bf). Despite that they did plan to get pregnant. I don't ask many questions regarding that - to each their own. \n2. I do not know their plans to cohabitate, for now, as far as I know, they will continue to live 40 mins apart. Though this question isn't about them.\n3. My sister moved a block away from me a year ago to be closer to me, and likes the area, which I've lived in for 5 years.\n4. The BF is not a terrible guy, he is very much involved and an intentional participant in this whole process, which makes their comment of me taking care of the kitty litter even more confusing. With his work schedule, he visits/stays over 1-3 per week, that I know of. \n5. Yes, their comment was light-hearted, in the way that you add an \"lol\" to a rather risky thing to say. \n6. The cat has been hers for 2 years, and is an indoor cat. ",

Since we have announced that we are getting married, it has caused problems with my family. \n\nThis took place on the 4th of July of this year. Me and my fiance were at my dads and step-moms house to celebrate. We were all talking over dinner where my dad brought up the fact that me and my fiance were moving too fast and need to wait to get married. I stated that we plan to get married in the summer of next year, which my step mom butted in saying that it would be wise for me to take the ring from my fiance and re-propse when **they** feel the time is right. I said it wasnt their decision to tell us when to get married. My step mom said that there were so many other people that I havent experinced yet. That made me so mad that I started shaking. I told them that we have benn together for years and I knew what I wanted. \n\nThe next night, my fiance brought up us breaking off the engagement, she thought it was her fault that my parents are acting so crazy over this. \"I would have asked to you wait if I knew this was the way your family was going to be.\" I told her that it wasnt their decsion regardless of how much they think it is. \n\nAITA for lashing out at my parents for not taking me seriously ",

There are a few reasons for this but the biggest one rn is that there aren’t a lot of openings for people with my degree right now. \n\nWith all this in mind, my parents suggested I go back to school to study something else. But as I’m sitting here signing up for classes, the only thing running through my head is my dad’s words from both times I graduated, “I’m not proud of you because it was expected.”\n\nNow I don’t need my parent’s approval for anything. But I’m working myself up I think way more than I need to over this. My dad also has some mental health issues and generational trauma that he’s working through so I’m not sure what he meant when he said that or how he would respond to me telling him how I’m feeling? My mother doesn’t even let me talk to him when I’m upset anymore. \n\nSo WIBTA if I told him how this is making me feel? ",

      "scenario_description": "After my entire life fell apart from completely unrelated reasons to this story I moved to a new city about a year and a half ago. I've since gotten back on my feet with a new job, lifestyle, and even found a group of friends that I used to hang out regularly with. We would cook dinners together, go to concerts, go out to bars, celebrate promotions, birthdays, and have fun together. I am an outsider to the group of friends, they all went to a local college in the city together, which I did not. But I felt like we all clicked. \n\nAt New Years James had told me he would propose to Sarah, both in the friend group, at the end of the year before Christmas, and had asked me to be on stand by for photos since I used to do photography as a side hustle and have a decent camera. I was excited for both of them and said absolutely. \n\nFast forward some time and since March the group chat the friend group had went pretty much inactive. Plans to hangout together started falling through, and I wouldn't see any of the friends at the gym anymore. I figured they were all busy with work, I mean I was too, so I didn't think much of it. I'd occasionally text some of the friends individually but that was it. \n\nA few days ago I get a text from one friend in the group, we will call Daniel, saying I'm being childish for not congratulating James and Sarah for getting engaged. Confused, I open instagram (for the first time in months, I don't use social media anymore really) and I see they are engaged. But, I see from their posts that they had a great party and celebration with everyone in the friend group, but me. Also, all the times I thought everyone was busy with work, I could see on their highlights they were out hiking, sailing, and doing other activities without me.\n\nFast forward to today and I get multiple texts from other people in the group describing me in a load of creative language that I'm essentially being a d\\*\\*\\* for not congratulating James and Sarah and also not giving them an engagement gift. \n\nIt seems to me I was removed unknowingly from this friend group a long time ago but am just finding out. I also feel like they're using this as an excuse to justify removing me from the group. I see no reason to be congratulating two people for becoming engaged when they clearly do not want anything to do with me. Am I happy for them? Yeah, but that's not my business anymore. AITA?",
