      "scenario_description": "\nHi.\n\nNeed some advice. I (24F) have my birthday dinner in a few days. I’m really excited. I haven’t done anything for my birthday in a few years, and this is the first time I’ve planned a nice intimate dinner party with 10 of my closest friends. \n\nClothes ordered, cake ordered, food done.\n\nI found out today from my mom that her sister’s husband is being tested for cancer. They live in a different country but we are all close as a family. Long story short, they found a lump, they suspect it’s cancer. He’s had a biopsy, and is scheduled for an MRI the same day I have my birthday dinner.\n\nNow, his daughter (22F) lives in the same city as us. She’s a student here. We’re quite close and she’s obviously invited to the dinner. When my mom told me about what was happening with her dad/my uncle, she said not to say anything to her because she doesn’t know and her parents don’t want to tell her until they know for sure. TBH, I was really annoyed because why have I been brought into this secret unwillingly. I don’t want to keep anything from her and I think it’s unfair that they won’t tell her.\n\nRegardless, this is news she needs to hear from her parents and not me I think. I did ask my aunt to tell her but she outright refused. \n\nI feel wrong hosting a birthday dinner knowing this huge thing is going on ESPECIALLY considering his daughter doesn’t know. \n\nI asked my parents what I should do, and my mom said to go ahead with it and my dad said to cancel it.  I was so excited for this birthday and I really want to go ahead with it. WIBTA if I do? \n\nEditing to add: conflict here is that I intend to continue having my birthday dinner but my dad is saying I should cancel it because it’s inconsiderate. WIBTA if I have it? ",

      "scenario_description": "I’ve (22f) posted here about my roommate (24f) before. She has always had issues contributing to the household, including buying things like toilet paper, dish soap, laundry detergent, etc. She also rarely does her dishes promptly or takes out the trash or other household chores, and struggles to pay utilities on time. Sometimes I even have to hound her for the rent. I felt bad at first because clearly she wasn’t equipped to live alone but I quickly got frustrated and became short with her. We were friends at first but not so much anymore after I’ve had to put up with her for this long. \n\nOur year long lease ended and we have been living month to month since then. Eventually she got a boyfriend. He lives with his parents but that hasn’t stopped her from spending most of her time at their house. I started seeing her less and less. \n\nA couple days into May I hadn’t seen her for maybe two weeks. I texted and called her to see when she was going to pay her share of rent (due on the 5th) but she basically ghosted me. I got in contact with her mom and eventually my roommate reached out to say she’s staying with her boyfriend’s family “for now” and doesn’t think she should be expected to pay rent for somewhere she’s not staying. I kindly asked if that meant she would be moving out but she didn’t respond. \n\nI paid rent myself, which was a huge unexpected expense. After that I decided I was done. I texted her over the course of May and June asking her to move her stuff out but she didn’t respond to me. Her mom kept promising me that her daughter would take care of it but she never once got back to me.\n\nAfter July started I recruited a couple friends to help me pack up the stuff in her room and donated most of it to Goodwill and the Salvation Army. I also asked the landlord to change the locks which he did. \n\nThe other evening she finally shows up and is mad that the locks have been changed. I told her she’s not living here and doesn’t pay rent so she has no reason to enter the apartment. She got even more upset and said that she was never moving out, she was just staying with him for the time being. She told me the situation didn’t work out so she planned to come back and live here again. I told her that she was already off the lease and it’s my rental now. She started crying and said she had nowhere else to go and I felt really bad. She asked if she could at least get some of her stuff, she needed some clean clothes and a shower. I told her that because she never told me she was coming back or made plans to move her stuff out, I donated everything that was in her room unless it looked precious or expensive and stored the rest in her closet. \n\nShe completely freaked out and threatened to call the police on me. She was inconsolable. She cried about how I even donated her dead grandmother’s wedding dress, which had been in a special box somewhere in her room. I apologized profusely because I did feel really bad but it all could have been avoided if she had tried to communicate with me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I told her by July I would start getting rid of things if she didn’t make plans to do it herself. Where I live, a unit is considered abandoned once they vacate and owe rent. The cost of the items being donated will determine how long I need to store them before getting rid of them. I asked her to make arrangements for her things beginning in early May, which she ignored. I emphasized in June that I would be donating her things by July, which she also ignored. Additionally, her mother was aware the whole time and promised me her daughter would take care of it by June 30th, which she didn’t. ",

      "post_title": "AITA for Adjusting my In-Laws Thermostat while Dog Sitting?",
      "scenario_description": "Never thought I would be posting here, but I need some help on how much I should dig in here…\n\nMy in-laws, who live about a 30 minute drive away, left for a 3 week vacation and asked us to watch their 2 dogs (one of which is older and needs special diet/meds/attention). My wife and I have 3 dogs of our own and a smaller house and yard, so the wife and their parents decided on house sitting while they were gone and just relocating to the in-laws place as the better choice for all logistics.\n\nWe moved a ton of stuff over, my wife is 6 months pregnant and we have a 2-year-old, so staying for a few weeks involved more than just a small bag as you can imagine. I even decided to breakdown my home office and move equipment so I would be here for the remote work hours with the dogs. Been going well, lots of furries running round the yard, getting all the pets and treats they could want.\n\nThe conflict. They (father-in-law) has a smart thermostat for the HVAC/AirCon. It is set with a predetermined automatic schedule. During the day he has it programmed set at 77F/25C. We are a little warmer than preferred during the day, we have popped it down a few times to 74F/23C to take the edge off, but have left it alone.\n\nAt night, the program on the thermostat is set to 80F/26C!!! Thermometer in the bedrooms shows actual temperatures to be about 78F/25.5C.\n\nAfter laying down on the first night for a bit and both myself and my pregnant wife uncomfortable and having trouble falling asleep with it being warmer than how we sleep at our house, I did a manual adjustment down to 74F/23C. I continued and made a manual adjustment down to this temperature each night. I have adjusted it now for a week  down to this lower temperature just so my family could be more comfortable and get a better nights sleep.\n\nFather-in-Law texted this morning upset. Saying to leave it alone, he received an energy and usage report that there has been an increase in the last week, and that we can sleep in the basement at night (no bed in basement and 6-month pregnant wife).\n\nI responded that they should call us later today and we could discuss further, but the plan was to reimburse them the energy cost difference for while we were staying here. I didn’t tell him this, but I plugged in house size, current energy prices, and HVAC unit into ChatGPT to estimate energy cost difference and AI said maybe a $30 - $40 cost difference for the little lower temperature at night for the three weeks. I don’t know how accurate this estimate is, but I would gladly pay $100+ if it meant my wife could sleep in a bed at a reasonable temperature and have no more argument on the subject.\n\nJudge me Reddit, be brutal, any feedback to help me decide how much push-back to give. AITA for adjusting my father-in-laws thermostat?\n\nEdit for detail: The in-laws 3 week vacation is a river cruise in Europe, so trying to just handle most things rather than bug them with too many texts while they are abroad.\n\nEdit 2: Just heard back from them after I offered to pay. He said “it’s potential damage to the hvac system with multiple temperature changes daily.  Energy cost is secondary.”  Lowering the HVAC temperature once at bedtime to 74 degrees, does that really run a risk of damage? (US Central Air, Lennox Compressor from 2022)\n\nEdit 3: They ended up calling as I asked, though begrudgingly as he said he didn’t know what needed to be talked about when I kept asking we all talk. One of my texts in the back-and-forth was that the unnecessary conflict was stressing out the pregnant wife and that realigned them a bit. I was in the shower with the call timing sadly, but he is going to remotely reprogram it to schedule night temps down to 75. In hindsight, how in the world did this devolve into conflict!?! I appreciate all the genuine feedback and responses so I had an understanding how firm I need to be with the situation.",

      "scenario_description": "My sister (31F) is staying with me temporarily after leaving her husband. I (30M) have a small apartment but I let her move in because she had nowhere else to go and she’s six months pregnant. I wasn't very pleased about this situation but she is my sis afterall.\n\nThe main issue has been food. I’m pretty disciplined about what I eat because I am in bulk stage and hitting the gym regularly. I portion things, label them and plan for the entire week. But every other day something’s gone. Makes me crazy.\n\nShe’ll drink all my expensive shakes, polish off meals I’ve prepped for work, eat snacks I’ve saved for post run, and even finish leftovers I was planning to turn into new meals. When I bring it up, she shrugs and says things like “Cravings hit hard” or “Hormones” or \"You are being mean\".\n\nI asked her to replace things she finishes or at least ask before taking something. Or hell, manage her own food for god's sake. She refuses to do anything about it.\n\nSo last week I ordered a small mini fridge and set it up in my bedroom. It’s just big enough for my meal prep, snacks and drinks. I didn’t make a scene about it. I just quietly started putting all my stuff there.\n\nShe noticed two days later and got pissed. She said I was being “childish,” “dramatic” and “treating her like a thief.” I calmly told her I was tired of my groceries disappearing and that this was the easiest way to avoid fights.\n\nNow she’s sulking and has told our parents after her failed marriage, her brother is also alienating her. And she is just a burden for everyone. My mom called and said I should “pregnancy isn’t easy” and especially for her situation.\n\nI don’t think I’m being cruel. I’m still letting her live here rent-free, and I’ve even offered to order food or cook together, but I just want my food to be left alone. A part of me understands she is going through trouble. But, at my expense?\n\nAITA?",

She doesn't use kennels for a number of reasons and I have always looked after her dogs in the past when her and her boyfriend have gone away.\n\nSo, if I usually look after her dogs, what has changed?\n\nThe last time she went away and I had to watch her dogs would have been last year. At the time she had a 3 year old Rottweiler named Dexter and, our childhood dog, an 11 year old Yorkshire Terrier named Pudsey. This is fine, I used to live with both dogs when me and my sister lived with our parents; of course the yorkshire terrier since I was like 10 and the Rottweiler for a couple years before moving etc. Dexter was also our 3rd Rottweiler as a family so, I can handle the breed.\n\nSince then, Pudsey has passed away and I adopted a rescue; a 7 year old Cane Corso named Roxie who is a saint. Roxie and and Dexter have met a couple times now and they get along well enough that I was still willing to dogsit for her. I WASN'T LOOKING FORWARD TO IT because, well, Dexter is a hassle. He's massive for one (weighs about 60kg to Roxies 40kg) and has literally endless energy. Energy he constantly redirects towards Roxie now. It can get too much for her but, I have ways to separate them when needed. Just to give her space.\n\nThat was until she started seriously considering getting another dog. Not just any dog but a puppy... So, upon hearing this, I told her \"I am not watching 3 dogs, on my own. One of which is a 60kg handful, the other a puppy\". And I was very clear, I put my foot down and outright told her and told my mum that I am not doing that. She can either wait A FEW MONTHS to get a new dog or can find a kennel for them.\n\nWell, looks like they take me for a dickhead as she now has a new chihuahua puppy. So? Looks like she's finding a kennel. Except my mum is adamant that I will still dogsit and that it isn't a big deal. They think because I work from home that, I have all the time to; baby sit a puppy, make sure Dexter isn't assaulting Roxie, walk them? I can't not walk them, it's 2 weeks. I walk Roxie for about 90 minutes a day (in the cooler weather) and I can't walk her and Dexter together? Nevermind a puppy in the mix?\n\n\"Why doesn't you mum watch one of them\" In her defence, she works 2 jobs. On most days; she's out of them house from 8am to 8pm with a couple hours home in between. I see why she can't watch a dog on her own either. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN WATCH 3? What about our dad? Well, our parents don't live together and his work schedule is a little unconventional. He essentially spends a week at work, living in, and then a week at home. He also lives about 6 hours away from my sister and 3 hours away from me so, for a number of reasons, I am the ONLY option.\n\nI'm being made out as a bad guy as my mum holds all of the things she did for me in the 22 years since I was born. Asking me to do it for her and how cruel it would be for me to refuse.",

      "scenario_description": "My (29F) husband (32M) and I have been married for 3 years, long distance because of the military. I’ve lived with his family during this time renting out a space. MIL had really welcomed me—I loved living there. Meanwhile, she’s been in the long term process of divorcing FIL, staying until now for financial reasons.\n\nThe last months of my time there, I was nearing the end of my pregnancy and my husband was preparing to deploy. It had been determined that I would move back in with my parents with the baby so my parents could help me with childcare. MIL offered for me and my husband to keep our stuff in the room upstairs as free storage until he’s back from deployment and we get our own place. I offered to pay her for it multiples times, she declined. When things were getting more heated between her and FIL, approximately 6 weeks before my due date/husband’s deployment date, I asked if she’d want us to move our stuff to an actual storage place—she said no, our stuff could stay.\n\nTwo weeks after a C section and 36 hours from my husband’s deployment, we were about to drive over with baby to my family’s house. MIL and FIL had an ongoing argument essentially about FIL wanting to move out because they were fighting so much and MIL wanting him to stay to help out with a planned surgery she had. FIL also had told her that he wasn’t going to financially support her unless he was forced to. She asked my husband to take sides with her and force FIL to stay. My husband told her he wasn’t comfortable getting in the middle of things. MIL became upset, and suddenly told us that if he wouldn’t help her in this argument, then we should move all our stuff out ASAP because she might have to sell the house.\n\nI expressed that it was a lot for her to throw on us (mainly me) all of a sudden, no yelling involved. That night she sent a lengthy text about how he and I were extremely selfish and not considering her situation and laid out all the kind things she’s ever done for us and how could we treat her this way etc.\n\nI reached out to try to talk. She texted me she wasn’t sure she’d ever be able to forgive us but would listen to what I had to say. Later on she changed her mind and said she didn’t want to talk after all.\n\nOur stuff is now in storage. I recently stopped by the house to pick up leftover stuff (FIL offered to take it to me but I wanted MIL to have a chance to see baby). Prior to going I’d asked and she’d texted that we were welcome to stop by anytime. However, she ignored my greeting when we arrived, refused to see baby when I offered and yelled at me when I told her that I wasn’t comfortable going over either but just wanted her to have a chance to see grandbaby. This time I did yell back about how she was calling me inconsiderate when she was also not considering my situation when she dropped the move on us. She texted my husband that she is upset with me for my attitude the original night and this latest visit and is now claiming that I am emotionally abusing her.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

My sister (36F) recently had a baby, who is now five months old. I love my nephew and visit them whenever I can after work, but it’s usually a long trip and I get home around 9 p.m. when I go there.\n\nI live with my mom, and she doesn’t like me taking showers after 9 p.m. because of the noise. Even though I pay the water and electric bills, I try to avoid fights and respect that.\n\nMy sister just returned from maternity leave and asked me to come help with the baby every day after work so she can shower and get things done. I told her that it’s difficult for me because of how late I get home and the problems it causes at home. I also mentioned that I’m usually exhausted after work and that going there daily would be too much.\n\nShe said it was fine, but then got really upset and started yelling at me. She brought up personal things, saying I can’t keep a job and making me feel like I’m unreliable. I was just trying to explain my situation, but she seemed to take it as an attack.\n\nNow I don’t feel comfortable going to her house anymore, even though I care about her and the baby. She has a husband and in-laws who could help her too, so I don’t feel like it’s fair for her to expect this much from me.\n\nStill, I worry that my family will think I’m being selfish or uncaring.\nAITA?\n",

I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   \n\nThis friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  \n\nI backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.  If you just pet them, they'll leave you alone.  After a brief convo, they decided to leave. I told them they don't call the shots at my house about my dogs.   The rest of my friends were split on how I acted. Some said it wasn't a big deal to put them in another room for a few hours and others said I was right.  AITA?  ",

      "scenario_description": "OK I have a lot of emotions concerning this issue, & I am kind of at the end of my rope, so I'm reaching out to the reddit community to ask: AITA\n\nMy stepmom (SM) and my dad have been together since I was 14. They have now been together for over 15  \nyears. While I have never had any glaring issues with my SM, we have never been particularly close. After my parents divorced, I stayed mainly with my mom who never remarried. My mother and I were extremely close. About two years ago my mom passed away and shortly after that, my SM began to introduce me as her daughter. I really bristled whenever she would do this because it felt like an erasure of my own mother. It also caused a lot of confusion for other people since my SM is quite young. They would often say things like \"My you must have had her early\" which in my opinion is just awkward for everyone involved. Eventually, I came out and told my SM that her calling me daughter was very painful for me and that I wanted her to stop. I also told her that I will never call her mother because I have an actual mother. Calling my SM mother felt like a racing my own history and the history of my mother.\n\nMy SM replied by telling me how painful the label of stepmother is to her. This is something I  \ndo not understand because she never had a SM. Her parents are still together.… so I just don't understand her perspective. She asked that I just call her by her first name when introducing her if I'm not going to call her mother, but that doesn't really work in practice. For example: \"Hi, this is \\[SM's name\\]\" \"Oh, how do you know each other?\". Then I explain, in a roundabout way, she is my SM...\n\nShe is also continued to call me daughter on another three occasions despite me telling her how painful this is for me. At this point, I don't know what to do. My dad is taking my SM's side and he has told me for years now that his relationship with her is more important than his relationship with me. The last time I tried to bring this up they both asked me why I was continuing to harp on the subject.\n\nNow I am a conflict turtle, so normally I would just let this be and avoid the situation. However, I recently became pregnant and reached out to my SM and sent her this message: \"You know I have a complicated relationship with calling you my mother but I want you to know you are this child's grandmother. I love you and am excited for us to be on this life journey together.\" Here is how she responded: \"We don't have a need for labels. We are excited to celebrate this child's life\". At this point, I'm really upset.\n\nUltimately, I am confused as to what direction to go and what to do. Sometimes I wonder: am I overreacting? Am I the asshole here? My stepmom and my dad make it seem as though I am. I am also open to any suggestions of what I can do going forward because I am at the end of my rope here. TY!",

Adding that my sister knows taekwondo and self-defense techniques, and can always think smart and call 911. \nShe then said that part time jobs are a huge waste of time and dont make any money in the long run. Also adding into the flames that she said that other jobs are better than part time, with a twisted comment saying that people with part time jobs suck or smth.\nSo i agreed to disagreed to ease her anger, but later on stated that part time jobs are able to help us out financially, since we're currently struggling for money, for my mom is on unpaid leave, and our budget is tightening day-by-day...\nShe then shouted at me to shut up cause i was too young to understand.\n\nSoo...

It's mostly about her hobbies and daily life, including venting about family members publicly. \\[It's not like OnlyFans or other NSFW content\\] \n\nBack when she was in high school and made the account I had already been on Instagram for a couple years so I followed her and we would often share posts/talk about them. But last summer she started changing her relationship with me and got really defensive about her social media. She told me not to follow her Instagram anymore because she doesn't want me to see what she's posting on there (keep in mind this is public so anyone can see what she posts - it's not private). It has blown up into a huge conflict between us where she says I'm 'invading her privacy' for reading what she posts and is really angry at me. \n\nShe's an adult and can post what she wants - I don't police her posts or comment on them.  But I feel like if she wants \"privacy\" then she shouldn't post things publicly and get upset if people see and talk about them. \n\nBut clearly she has a very different perspective, and I hate that this has hurt our relationships. She refuses to talk to me about it and just insists she is right in her view and my actions are beyond horrible. \\[Again, I do not interact with her public posts, but I do read them and she knows that\\]. \n\nSo tell me - AITA for reading my younger sister's public social media profile?",

      "scenario_description": "I’m 31F and my mom (Brenda, 55F) and I are honestly pretty close. But there’s this one thing she does that’s been getting under my skin for years. Basically, if I tell her anything about my life, she’ll go and talk about it with the whole extended family. Like... everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins, even random relatives I barely know or haven’t seen in forever. Nothing’s too small—she’ll mention stuff about who I’m seeing, stuff with my job, health stuff, money stuff... just everything.\n\nI’ve told her to stop doing that so many times. Like I’ll say “hey, I don’t want anyone else knowing about this,” and she’ll nod like she gets it—but then later I hear she’s been talking. And when I call her out, she always says something like, “Oh, come on, it’s just family!” or “I wasn’t gossiping, I was just chatting.” Like??? That doesn’t really make it better.\n\nAnyway, not long ago I had this minor medical thing done—nothing serious, but definitely personal. I told her ahead of time, super clearly, that I didn’t want anyone else knowing. Just wanted to keep it to myself.\n\nThen like three days later, I start getting these “how are you feeling??” texts from a bunch of my aunts. And yep—turns out my mom told them. Again.\n\nI was honestly so frustrated. I called her and told her straight up that I felt like she didn’t respect my privacy, and that I was hurt she went and told people again after I asked her not to. I told her I need her to stop sharing my life like that—it’s not just casual chatting when it’s stuff I asked her to keep private.\n\nShe got really upset. Said I was attacking her, said I was overreacting and being cold, and now she won’t talk to me. My dad says I should’ve handled it “more gently” and that I made her feel bad. So now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far.\n\nWas I the asshole for putting my foot down?",

      "scenario_description": "Hello, 19f here and over the past few months I've restarted therapy through my university. It's every other week and completely free for students. I've liked the person they matched me with and it's been going well.\n\nI have a complicated relationship with my family and therapy. My parents put my sister and I in therapy when I was 14 in response to a traumatic event. My sister clicked with her therapist immediately but it took me five tries, as well as an unhelpful OCD diagnosis, to finally get diagnosed with PTSD and do EMDR that helped me. These five tries were all between the ages of 14-17.\n\nI have the feeling that my family judges me for not 'getting better' as quickly as my sister. There's a lot of \"It didn't work because you didn't try as hard as her,\" \"She's actually willing to put in the work,\" and \"Unlike her, you manipulate your therapists.\" I feel bitter about it because I told them early on that I wasn't ready to talk about what happened, they didn't listen when I said I didn't feel comfortable, and then they were surprised when it didn't work. They also said \"We put you in therapy so that you'll be upset there instead of with us.\"\n\nAt the end of every session, they would ask me what I talked about and then give me an agenda list of things to talk about the next week. Then, and this upset me the most, they would tell other people about it. Not just other family members, but randos like \"oh \\[my name\\] is in trauma therapy and they think she has PTSD but we'll see when she discusses this and that.\" The thing that happened was on the news against my family's wishes and then frequently brought up in the town council meetings and even in our schools, and I already hated feeling talked about, so having my parents share the treatment I was getting for it felt like more salt in the wound.\n\nWhen I went to college, I told my parents that I was very anxious and panicked a lot and it was interfering with my ability to function. They said \"We tried getting you help and you didn't want it so now you need to get it yourself. We're not helping you.\" I went and found my own therapist and didn't tell them. I didn't want them to tell every person I knew that I was feeling anxious/ask me what I discussed/look up the therapist and contact them themselves/tell me how I picked an incompetent person and would just fail again.\n\nRecently my sister and I had an argument and she told me it upset her that I wasn't in therapy, because she feels I don't value her enough to 'try to get better.' I told her that I have been in therapy for the past several months. She said that made her angrier because she felt like I was lying to her. Now my parents are angry too, they all say they feel lied to.\n\nI'm wondering if I'm TA? Initially I felt like I did nothing wrong, it's my own treatment and I'm facilitating it all myself. But my sister said \"My definition of true family includes being honest\" so now I'm worried I'm an awful sister who doesn't value her family enough.",

      "scenario_description": "**Before anyone says ‘just build a fence’ WE CAN’T AFFORD IT RIGHT NOW. And no, no HOA.**\n\nMy neighbor set up one of those pantries/farm stands where people can take items that they grew in their garden, pantry stuff, donated stuff, etc. In theory it’s a great idea and especially in a time when life in America sucks ass and people are struggling to make ends meet (my family included)\n\nThe problem: people started coming into MY yard to pick things in MY garden. I’ve put up signs saying not to do it, I installed rabbit fence around the garden, I’ve angled a tarp so you can’t see what’s there from the road. People just hold their kids over the fence to pick tomatoes and beans or jump it.\n\nI ended up getting into an argument with a lady over it. I yelled HEY, STOP. THOSE ARE NOT FOR YOU TO TAKE. She told her kid to move faster and then tried to run away. I caught up to her and asked her what the fuck her problem was and she turned it into how dare I swear in front of her child, why am I so angry, am I really that upset about a couple tomatoes. I said I am upset that you are STEALING from me.\n\nThe next day, I approached my neighbor. I asked if I could maybe help move it to the other side of their driveway so it’s next to the other neighbor’s house. They don’t have a garden out front. They said at least not until the end of the season. I asked if they could make larger signs, talk to people, just do SOMETHING..\n\nThey were like “can you really not afford to share?” I said that they aren’t taking my zucchini because they’re starving, they’re taking my tomatoes because they WANT them. They said that I’m going to have to learn to live with it for now and we can talk about a solution together that will benefit the whole community after. I said I do not care about a solution that benefits the whole community. I care about a solution that stops people from STEALING FROM ME.\n\nSo last night it happened again, man in his 50s. I sprayed his ass with the hose. He started yelling at me and after a minute or so the neighbor came out yelling at me too. People have posted on the neighborhood board to be careful if they come by because I’m an asshole. The neighbor says I’m scaring people away from a community resource. I told him that I’m going to continue until he does something about the fucking thieves who feel entitled to MY GARDEN.\n\nI feel like I’m losing my fucking mind here. Am I the asshole for asking them to move it? Am I the asshole for being PISSED OFF that people are fucking STEALING from me? This is food for my family.\n\n**First off, thanks for the responses. I got some good ones.** I'm happy that so many of you live in places where the cops would do anything about this, but this isn't the reality I'm living. Cops here would not give a shit if I sent them a video of someone picking from my garden. They would laugh in my face. Be thankful if you live in a place where the police are useful.\n\n**It looks like signs are the best option for now.** Going to make signs indicating heavy use of pesticides and repeating that they are stealing food from the mouths of hungry children. I don't know why the signs we already have up aren't enough. Maybe more will help. I'm sure they won't.\n\n**Will also scour Craigslist for free fencing** or similar items. Hopefully that pans out.",

      "scenario_description": "I (26M) was at a crowded park recently where there were food trucks set up and people sitting around eating. Seating was pretty limited, and most people were sitting on this low concrete wall that runs along the edge of a parking lot. On the other side of the wall is a grassy area that's level with the top of the wall, so people sit with their backs toward the grass and legs facing the lot.\n\nI had just gotten my food when I noticed the only free spot left. At the same time, I saw a girl, well dressed for the park also walking toward it. She saw it first and was headed that way, but I was closer and got there before her despite her running when she saw me approaching it.\n\nAs I got to it, I looked down at the grass behind the wall and saw a big pile of dog poop right where someone’s lower back or clothes would land if they leaned or sat back. It was pretty gross, and I decided not to sit.\n\nRight then, she walked up and looked annoyed, saying, “Seriously? I was going to sit there.” I didn’t want to make a thing of it, so I just stepped aside and said, “Go ahead, you can have it.”\n\nShe immediately sat down without checking behind her and just a second later jumped up with a disgusted look on her face. The poop was stuck to the back of her skirt. She turned to me and snapped, “Why didn’t you say anything?”\n\nI told her, “I saw it, yeah, but I didn’t know how you were planning to sit. For all I knew you were just going to perch on the edge or sit upright. It’s a park — people walk their dogs here. You’ve got to check before sitting down.”\n\nShe kept insisting I should’ve warned her, but I told her I wasn’t trying to be petty, I genuinely didn’t know how far back she was going to lean or sit, and it wasn’t really my responsibility to check the ground for her. She could have sat only on the wall and not on the grass and would have been fine.\n\nShe eventually walked off frustrated, but now I’m wondering if I should’ve just said something anyway. But I feel like especially since she was so confrontational about the spot it wasn't really necessary.\n\nAITA?",

I didn't invite as it was a toddler party with only 5 2-3 year olds. \n\nMy living room isn't very big and I know her son is sensitive to loud noises and thought with all the screaming and fighting it wouldn't be a good idea. He also has to blow out candles even if its not his birthday, which, in my opinion isn't fair and would take focus off my boy.\n\nHe doesn't share toys and, in previous experiences, not even let my son play with his own toys in his own home, and even though the other children were fighting over toys, the parents, including mysel, were stopping snatching and inforcing sharing, even if it caused a tantrum.\n\nI am getting mixed reviews from people around me and I still personally didn't think it would be a good idea but she's made me feel like I was wrong for it.\n\nThank you for all or insights.. \n\nUpdate:-\nSince the party we had a little get together and the 2 toddlers were fighting and screaming about sharing his new toys, constantly trying to stop arguments and the neighbours son came along aswell, when ever the screaming started, it was as I feared the loud noises were too much, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere for the neighbours boy, covering his ears,  sprinting out into the communal gardens, as if he was trying to escape. It started off quietly, but then, as the toddlers got tired, it leveled up gradually. \n",

I was taking a shower when they got here so I didn’t know they were here. My switch was on the livingroom couch charging.\n\nNow for context their son has really bad behavior problems. He flips out over everything and will scream and cry for hours. He also loves to break things for no reason. So overall a bad kid.\n\nfrom what my brother told me the kid had picked it up and one of his parents (not sure who) was trying to take it from him since he’s rough with stuff and they didn’t want him to break it. This set off the kid so he started screaming and crying. I heard this part while I was in the shower but I didn’t think anything of it since he’s always throwing tantrums. I figured my switch would be safe cus it’s my apartment and I should be able to leave stuff out without fear of it getting broken.\n\nSo after I got out of the shower I walked into the living room and my brother has my switch next to him. Said switch has the screen all cracked and one of the joycons disconnected. obviously I’m pissed and I ask what happened. Apparently the kid got mad that they wouldn’t let him have it so he grabbed it and ran into the kitchen and threw it down and started stomping on it. Which is pretty on brand because he does the same thing with phones or other electronics when he can’t have them. This kid is really heavy but I didn’t think heavy enough to the point the screen on my switch wouldn’t work anymore. And I’m not sure what happened to the joycon but it won’t slide on all the way I think something got bent?\n\nI grabbed my switch and went to my room to text my mom because she was at work. So my mom calls me a while later on one of her breaks and is flipping out about it. As she should because that was 300$ of my own money. So she hangs up and calls my brother and is flipping out on him about it. I was still in my room so idk what exactly she said. They ended up leaving with their kid.\n\nThen my mom came home and suddenly her attitude has completely switched. She’s telling me that she’ll buy me a new one when she gets the money and how the kid didn’t mean it and he didn’t know. And I’m still pissed so I ask her why my brother or his gf can’t replace it and she makes excuses about how my brother doesn’t work and he doesn’t have alot of money. THE REASON HE DOESNT HAVE MONEY IS CUS HES A BUM AND WONT GET A JOB AND SELLS WEED. His girlfriend works at a fucking taco truck so obviously between the two of them they can barely afford their expenses. They’re constantly asking my mom for money to cover the bills.\n\nnow we’re at a standstill. My mom is making excuses for why my brother or his gf can’t buy me a new one. They could easily buy me a new one if my brother stopped being a bum and got a job.\n\nIk I’m not in the wrong but I wanna see Reddit flame my family.",

      "post_title": "AITA for banning my mum’s boyfriend from my life after what he did at my grandad’s funeral?",
      "scenario_description": "My mum (56) has been dating a man (“Adam”) for 5 years. I’m 28F. They met online during COVID and said “I love you” within 3 weeks—before they’d even met in person. At the time, we had just gotten out of a 20+ year abusive home situation (our mum didn’t protect us—we got us all out), We’d encouraged her to date to stop her going back to dad, but the intensity of the relationship raised red flags.\n\nAdam is in his late 50s, never married, supposedly has a good job but nothing to show for it. I suspect he gambles, he watches every sport, every team, obsessively. He lives in England; we’re in Ireland.\n\nThere have always been red flags—subtle digs about my mum aging, calling her decisions “our” decisions but keeping his private. He makes no effort with family and isolates her. I think he’s using her and possibly planning to freeload off her divorce settlement.\n\nThe final straw was him watching football on his phone for 15+ minutes at my grandad’s funeral. I waited a few weeks to tell my mum. When I did, he denied it—she believed him over me.\n\nThings got tense. My sister 22F and I ended up in family therapy (without him) and agreed to one last conversation with Adam. We told our mum: if it went badly, she could keep seeing him, but she had to stop trying to involve us. It was a big deal—we were anxious and triggered by having to confront a man about his behaviour, given our past.\n\nThe conversation was awful. He said, “We’ll agree to disagree,” then admitted he “glanced” at his phone, then finally admitted to watching the match. Still—no apology.\n\nSince then (6 months ago), we’ve had no contact with him. I’ve told him I don’t want to speak to him again. Now my mum is saying we need to “fix things” and come for dinner to “sort it out.” She gets upset when we say no.\n\nI’m exhausted. I can’t control who she dates—but I won’t be around him. It’s stressful, triggering, and upsetting. Some people say we’re being “overly sensitive” due to cPTSD. But honestly, we’re too tolerant—we survived years of abuse. If we were fragile, we would’ve broken. We didn’t.\n\nNow I’m getting married next year. And I’m already heartbroken because my dad won’t walk me down the aisle—not because he’s gone, but because of what he did to us. That’s something I’ve had to grieve. But now it feels like another man in my mum’s life is going to ruin another major moment. My graduation, birthdays—those were all made miserable by my dad. And now it feels like my wedding could be overshadowed by another man she’s putting first. I just don’t understand how it’s unreasonable to want my wedding day to be about me—for once—not about managing someone else’s boyfriend.\n\nMy mum clearly thinks I’m the problem—that I’m being difficult and dramatic because of our past. And honestly, I’m starting to feel like I am the asshole. But deep down, I don’t think I am. I just feel like one for standing my ground.\n\nAITA for drawing this boundary and saying I don’t want to spend Christmas or my wedding with this man?\n\nEdit: my mum will definitely come to my wedding, we are actually really close and get on so well (apart from this drama) which is why it’s even more hurtful. When it’s not about men we have a really good relationship. It does feel more like a sister relationship - she’s honestly not a bad person, she is a great mum in lots of ways, she just makes really bad decisions with men that make it look that way. \n\nMy little sister has supported me and been there for me through everything - she’s who will walk me down the aisle we’ve been through everything together it’s only right ❤️ \n\nFurther edit: \nI have said to her about going No contact if she continues to force him on us and she feels this is me forcing her to break up with him and not letting her make her own decisions.

      "scenario_description": "I love my niece, and I support her creative expression. I’ve told her that she could make me a dress for running around the house, running errands, hanging out, etc. I’m happy to wear something she’s made at times where it’s appropriate. I’ve worn the acrylic scarf she crocheted me for a few years now and it’s not because it looks good.\n\nShe uses youtube and tiktok tutorials, so she doesn’t know how to work off patterns, make tailoring adjustments, choose the right fabric, etc. On tiktok and other social media spaces the “cool” thing to do is announce that you made your garment from a ratty thrifted sheet using an old pair of shorts you had lying around. Sometimes it looks good, sometimes it doesn't. But she doesn’t take the time to do things like pressing or finishing steams, trimming or sewing in ends, etc. When I’ve suggested it to her, she said it’s more authentic the way she does it.\n\nShe begged me to do an outfit for an event I have coming up where I’ll be on stage. I tried to let her down gently and said that I had a dress being tailored as we speak. She said I could wear that one to something else, but that I should wear something she made because it would be special and a bonding experience for us. Everyone in my family is obsessed with “bonding experiences.” Everything has to be a bonding experience between the adults and kids. It’s exhausting.  I reiterated my no, saying “No, I do not want you to make me anything.” \n\nHer mom (my sister in law) is telling me that I care way too much about my appearance and my image. This is an event related to my career. The last thing I need to do is walk up on stage in something that doesn’t fit, or looks like it was made with a sheet. And especially because I am plus sized, how I look is judged more harshly.\n\nSIL complaining about me being superficial is not new. I dared to buy ONE designer bag for myself and she did the whole thing you see on Reels, the whole “STUPID! I would just thrift a bag and put the rest of my money IN the bag!” bit. I was briefly engaged and she would not shut up about how I supposedly wanted a wedding, not a marriage because I dared to want to pick out my own decor and not just use whatever she could scrounge up on Marketplace or get for sale at the craft store.\n\nMy career is the most important thing in the world to me right now. Obviously for my SIL, her child is the most important thing in the world to her. But am I correct to put my career ahead of her child’s feelings, or do my values automatically make me the asshole?",

      "post_title": "AITAH for eating most of her birthday cake?",
      "scenario_description": "My wife (32f) and I (35m) were recently on vacation over the 4th of July, which also happens to be my wife's birthday. We had all the normal traditions for our family, including cake. We all had a piece day-of but almost nobody ate cake the entire rest of the trip. When the time came to return home, in-laws (MIL made the cake) offered to send the whole thing with us because they \"didn't need all that and we will probably just throw it away.\" My wife hates food waste, so she brought it. The journey home was two days by car. It has since been two additional days since we got back. Each night after dinner, I've had a reasonably sized piece of the cake for desert. I used to be a bigger guy and while I have much better habbits now, I still have a soft spot for baked goods...the cake was \"budgeted for\" though and I had been looking forward to eating a little. Well today my wife saw that there was only one slice left and was irate... Saying I was completely selfish and had eaten almost all of HER cake. I told her the cake had been available to all for nearly a week (counting days it sat on the counter before we took it home with us) and that nobody had bothered to touch it but me. I did apologize after she finished explaining to me that it upset her but I dont understand why it's such a big deal to begin with. The cake was right there...she never even had a bite.\n\nFor additional context, in the past she has requested that certain foods be saved for her as leftovers etc. Ive obliged, only for that food to sit until it had become moldy and she claims she \"forgot it was in there, oops.\" For someone who hates food waste, allegedly, I find this behavior doubly puzzling... Was I wrong here?\n\nEdit to answer some recurring questions:\n\nIt isn't, nor has ever been a \"my cake\" or \"your cake\" situation in our family. Its just THE cake, to be shared. There has never been an expectation beyond making sure the birthday person gets the first slice. After that, its just a regular old cake.\n\nThe courtesy some are relaying is to simply ask if she wanted a slice while im serving myself. In our home, this has never really been a consistent thing. It does happen, but its not an expectation and doesnt happen every time. Desserts are just understood to be periodically available and if you want some, its there. Different rules for small children notwithstanding...\n\nFinally...we ate on the drive. Idk why people exclude those two days from when the cake was available. Obviously we didn't drive 48 hours straight without sustenance... and the first night we obviously had to park and rest somewhere. And besides that we were home for dinner on the second day as well.\n\nUpdate: I have decided to simply bake her the exact same cake, in a smaller tin just for her. It will be her cake and nobody else will touch it. If it gets wasted, so be it. I hate the waste but its not worth the division.\n\nUpdate 2: the remade cake was much appreciated. She has yet to take a single bite. Not going to track progress. The cake was made as an apology, not to test the theory. This is the final update. ",

But she of course wants to see scary stuff and throws temper tantrums when we say no. \n\nLast night my wife and our two older kids wanted to watch Alien and we figured we'd watch it after our youngest daughter was in bed ( since it's summer we've bumped her bedtime up to 9:30 ).\n\nAfter my wife and I put our daughter to bed we went downstairs to start the movie. After the movie had started our youngest daughter came down and asked what movie we were watching. We asked her why she wasn't in bed and she said she heard her sister mention that we were gonna watch a movie and asked if she could watch to. \n\nWe told her no because it was too scary for her but she kept insisting that she could handle it. I eventually firmly told her no but she kept insisting that she could handle it. \n\nSo I picked her up and carried her back to her bed, she screamed and protested the whole time saying \" no daddy I wanna watch the movie \"!\n\nWhen I tucked her back in bed she kept protesting saying it wasn't fair to have family movie time without her, that's when I said to her \" this is not family movie time this is a time for people who are big enough for scary movies and you're too little for scary movies \".\n\nShe said \" no daddy I'm big enough for scary movies \" and tried to get out of bed, thats when I raised my voice and firmly told her \" no your too little for scary movies and it is past your bedtime now if you get out of bed again your in trouble \"! \n\nI then tucked her back into bed and kissed her goodnight.\n\nThen we all watched the movie as planned, we could hear our daughter screaming and having a tantrum from upstairs for a while but we ignored it and it did stop. \n\nI thought i handed it fine until today when my wife came to me very upset with me for how I handled it. \n\nShe said it would've been better to just let her watch a movie that was appropriate for her with us and then put her to bed and watch Alien because then she wouldn't have felt excluded. I disagreed because our daughter knew it was past her bedtime. But my wife still thinks I didn't handle it right. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

She has a short American first name. I'm used to calling her by her first name but my dad doesn't like that. He wants me to call her Ms (her last name), a variation of mom, and some other title of authority. I call her Ms (her last name) when my dad is around but I call her by her first name when it's just her and I. My stepmom doesn't like it when people mispronounce or struggle to say her last name.

      "scenario_description": "I (29F) co-own a home with my mom and sister. I live in the basement, which has been my private space. Today, my mom told me that my cousin from overseas (who I barely know) and her two young kids are coming to stay with us for the entire summer, and that they'll be staying in the basement with me in the spare room. I'I protested and she called me selfish. I don’t even know the names of my cousins kids at all, and I value my personal space and quiet. I also work night shifts so when I come home in the morning to sleep I don’t want to be disturbed with any noise. \n\nAlso, my mom and sister are going on a 10-day cruise next month, and I was really looking forward to having the house to myself for once. My family can be pretty overbearing. When I brought this up, my mom just said, *“Well, now you won’t be home alone!”* like that was a good thing. I told her she made this decision without considering me at all and that I don’t plan to host or entertain anyone while they’re gone.\n\nFor added context: the last time a cousin stayed with us from overseas, my mom pressured me into giving her money so she could shop. I’m afraid that history will repeat itself, but 3x as much since she's bringing her kids too.\n\nAt this point, I’m so upset I’m seriously considering going to a hotel for those 10 days just to have peace. It feels like my space and comfort were completely disregarded and I don't want to give up my personal space.  AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT 1: My basement space is fully open to the upstairs there’s no door, just a staircase. So it’s not like I can lock anything or really block off my space, plus the laundry room is in the basement which everyone needs access to. \n\n  \nEDIT 2: Yes, I legally co-own the home. My name is on the title and the deed. I live in the basement, which has its own living area and bathroom. There are two rooms down there, mine and a spare room that my brother uses when he visits like once a month, but he only stays for a weekend when he comes. \n\nThat spare room is the one my mom is giving to my cousins. They won’t be in my actual bedroom, but since the basement is open with no door separating it from the rest of the house, I’ll basically be sharing my entire living area with people I don’t know all summer.\n\n",

Nothing is ever good enough. Or nothing is ever as good as his stuff. \n\nI decided to have a small cookout at my house. He has made comments about its location and quality many times before. Nonetheless, we’re planning to have good food, drinks, and a whole lot of other stuff to spend some time with our friends and relax a little, and they’re both invited. My bestie is worried about her boyfriend’s cat allergies. I have two cats. Both hide when people are over. She asked me to lock them in the room for the day to not upset his allergies. He has been to my house twice now and has never complained about my cats. \n\nI simply told her no. After she persisted, I reminded her he’s been around them, and their fur, which lingers around at all times in the past. I asked what he did then to manage it. She said take Benadryl. I recommend he take it again before/after his visit. She persisted. So I said I’m not locking my cats in a room for the day. And so far that’s been that. \n\nAITA? I’m not sure if my dislike of her boyfriend is clouding my judgement. But I also think of how panicked and uncomfortable my cats will be, and it seems unreasonable to request that from me. Also, their discomfort really doesn’t seem worth his company. I don’t know… AITA??",

      "scenario_description": "I have a 4 year old son with special needs and I am a single parent so day to day life can be overwhelming sometimes.  My mom always wanted to go on a cruise so last year I saved to treat her, my son, and I to go on a 7 day cruise for her 70th birthday.  I paid for everything except her passport and airline ticket (hotel, cruise fare, excursions, all of her purchases, tips, gratuities, transportation to port).  For the three of us, it was close to $8,000. We went over Christmas break and were in an ocean balcony. \n\n While I had fun, we always had to do what she wanted since it was \"her cruise\" so I missed out on a lot.  She spent most of the time eating (and complaining about the lack of her favorite foods) and how boring everything was (she never wanted to leave the room).  If I booked anything, she would wait to the last minute to decide not to do it so I lost money.    At the end of the cruise, she commented that we should do an entire family cruise this year.  I told her that my son and I would be taking a vacation by ourselves this year.  I was planning Disney but my son is still afraid of the characters so I decided to do another cruise.  \n\nI found one that was 8 days and would only cost my son and I $3100 plus airfare (we are going over Christmas break).  I put down the deposit but haven't finished paying it off.  \n\nLast night, she asked me who my travel agent was because she wanted to take a trip.  I asked where she wanted to go and she mentioned the 4 stops my son and I will be going on (we had talked about it back in January as a large family trip).   She said she wanted to come along with my cousin.  My cousin is not someone I want my son around.  I really don't want them to come because I really want to enjoy my vacation and get to experience everything my son and I want to do.  \n\nWIBTA if I told her I don't want her and my cousin to come along because I want to enjoy my trip.

For context, this is my grandmother's name (unrelated to my cousin) so last year when abuela heard about my cousin's Gabriella, she was so delighted to have a baby with her name. Seeing this, we thought my abuela would be even happier if her great granddaughter was named after her.\n\nNow, at the most recent family dinner I overheard a couple family members talking about how it was weird that I named my daughter Gabriella, because my cousin's daughter is already named that. As far as I know it's just a name that they like and bears no special significance/family name. I also saw my cousin and she was acting a bit weird/cold towards me.\n\nSince we have a big Latino family all in the same city (9 babies/toddlers in total) we all see each other quite a bit at holidays, birthdays, etc. I wonder if they're upset that it'll be awkward with the same name.\n\nI feel like 1) no one should have a \"claim\" to a name and 2) if anything, my abuela had the name first on my side of the family, so \"Gabriella\" has much more meaning to us. Another relative also suggested using nicknames to differentiate them, but my grandmother goes by \"Gabby\" so that's what we would want to use too; however, my cousin already calls her baby Gabby.\n\nAITA for naming my baby after my abuela?\n \n\n",

      "scenario_description": "Hi all, I (18F) am currently in my final year of high school and have been under a lot of pressure lately. I spend upwards of 5 hours on schoolwork every weekday and 9–10 hours on weekends to keep up with my final year coursework. I have chronic joint pain, and my specialist has warned that I’m at risk of permanent nerve damage if I don’t start pacing myself but rest has been difficult to come by.\n\nThere’s currently a lot of extra noise and responsibility in the house. My extended family recently went on a two-week overseas holiday, and my parents volunteered us to look after their pets while they’re away. (We didn’t go on the trip ourselves, because my parents felt I “should be using this time to study.”) So on top of our own animals, we’re now looking after two more large dogs and a bird that I am expected to help care for.\n\nThe bird has a habit of defecating in my drinks and screeching at all hours. I’ve been trying to make the best of the situation but I’d already been woken up at 4:30am by one of the dogs (which happens often), and I was in a lot of pain from overuse of my dominant hand.\n\nIn that moment, I cracked. I made a sarcastic and admittedly aggressive comment (something along the lines of “I’m going to rotisserie fry that bird and wash him down with dog blood”) not realising my mum was on the phone with my grandmother (the bird’s owner) at the time. She overheard and got very upset.\n\nI apologised later that day and clarified that I would never actually harm the bird, it was just a very ill-timed joke made out of frustration and exhaustion. But my family is still acting cold with me, and I’ve been told that lately I’m “acting intense” and owe further apologies. I feel like I’ve been trying to hold everything together for months under constant pressure, and now I’m being punished for having one outburst.\n\nAITA for what I said?\n",

      "scenario_description": "So I recently went to my boyfriend’s father’s wedding (remarriage) His father was kind enough to take into account my gluten allergy and made sure to have 8/10 dishes gluten free. He also included a separate GF dessert which was little Bundt cakes. \n\nI was so excited to actually eat at the wedding. Most times for a public event I either eat before due to my allergy. \n\nAfter dinner, the cake was being cut and then it was announced to come get dessert. I was finishing up a conversation (took 30-45 seconds) when my boyfriends uncle (who is the only other GF person) came up to me with a cake and told me that all ten cakes were gone and he had the last one, offering to share half. \n\nI was upset. I know that only 2 people had an allergy there. I immediately went over to investigate the gluten free cakes with my boyfriend following. \n\nI went over and i spotted a family who I know well and I KNOW are not GF, and went up to confront them. When I got there I saw them have not one, not two, but THREE GF cakes all of which were eaten except for a tiny sliver of one and the other that the husband was just finishing off.  I politely ask the husband if he was GF (knowing full well he wasn’t) He responded “well ya totally I prefer gluten free it tastes better ya…” I look at him and told him that I have an allergy and I didn’t get any.  after an awkward moment, the wife finally says “oh well…here you can have this if you want…” and she reached to give me the mostly eaten cake. I told them no it’s fine just next time don’t eat allergen friendly food if you don’t have an allergy and walked off to my boyfriend who was only a few feet away and told him everything. \n\nA bit later I was talking to some friends when the wife came up behind me and said “hey that wasn’t very nice what you did back there. You made us feel very uncomfortable and my husband feels bad and uncomfortable with your actions. It would be nice of you to go an apologize to him.” I daid “sorry?”And she said just go over and apologize. I bit my tongue and went to talk to my boyfriend In private. I told him I was in fact not sorry and had no regret for calling out them eating MY allergy friendly food. He agreed with me and told me not to apologize and ignore the incident. But I can’t get this off my mind…\n\nSo am I the asshole and should I go apologize  for making the family feel uncomfortable??\n\nEDIT: My boyfriend told me to edit this to inform I was Autistic so if I seem dense in the comments I’m genuinely not understanding and am taking it literally. THIS IS NOT TO EXCUSE MY ACTIONS ONLY EXPLAIN MY EXTRA QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS!! (bottom should have the original post! ) \n\nEDIT: I realize I left out some info pointed out i. In comments. Idk if it matters. The family I confronted was in charge of the dessert table as the caterers were only in charge of dinner. Dessert was set up by the family and was told by the groom to section off and keep the GF cakes separate and were also told who they were for explicitly. ",

So my parents (mother 54 and father 64) have been married 37 years and have started to really complain about each other to me. It kind of forces me to play both sides since I live with and love my parents so I don’t want to side with either. It’s normally small things like feeling disrespected by something the other has said or being upset with the others habits and behaviours, but it has gotten to the point where they will say things to me like I don’t know if I can keep doing this or if this doesn’t change I’m not sure if I’ll be here, which really puts me on the spot and makes me uncomfortable.\n\nSo I guess my question is would I be the asshole for telling them I no longer want to be brought into it and that I think they should go talk to a professional instead.\n\nMaybe I’m blowing this out of the water and it’s normal for a couple that’s been married this long, or it just seems like a big deal since I have no experience in relationships.\n\nThanks for listening!",

      "scenario_description": "I (20F) come from an African household where family is everything. Growing up, I never had a birthday party because it was considered “too expensive,” and I’ve never really received gifts from my family, aside from the occasional one from a friend or my boyfriend. So birthdays have always been a bit sore for me.\n\nMy niece’s birthday is on September 21st, and mine is on the 27th. When my sister told me she wanted to throw a party for my niece’s first birthday, I was obviously happy to attend. I go to uni in Plymouth, and my family is in London, so I booked time off work to travel up for the weekend of the 21st, assuming the party would be held then.\n\nBut now my sister has booked a hall for the 27th, my birthday. She said she couldn’t do the party the weekend of my niece’s actual birthday because she didn’t want her friends to have to travel with their kids on a Sunday, and she refuses to do it on the Saturday (the 20th) because “you can’t celebrate a birthday before it’s happened.”\n\nSo now she’s settled on my birthday weekend instead. I wanted to spend the day with my boyfriend. I already booked time off for that weekend, and so did he. We were planning something lowkey but meaningful, especially since this year is my 21st and my first proper milestone birthday that I’ll be able to celebrate.\n\nMy sister is saying I already agreed to come (which I did, before I knew the date had changed). She even said I could bring my friends, but none of my London friends will be around, they’ll all be back at uni too. And my uni friends from Plymouth obviously can’t travel 5 hours and miss uni just to come to a kid’s party full of strangers.\n\nI love my niece and I do want to celebrate her, but I’ve never been able to celebrate properly, and now the one time I thought I could, i might be stuck alone again.\n\nSo… AITA for not wanting to go to my niece’s birthday anymore, even though I originally said I would?",

Wish I could make it but enjoy and let’s exchange pictures as it’s a big birthday for her and for me. I hope to come next year.”  This is her scheduling issue, not yours. If she can schedule after the  birthday she could schedule before but she didn’t. If anyone complains, tell them you agreed to come but  she moved the date, and you have plans. Your 21st birthday is far more important than your nieces 1st, as she won’t remember any of this, but you will.",

      "scenario_description": "So a friend of mine recently self-published a children’s book on Amazon. She made a big announcement on social media about how excited she was to start this new chapter in her life as an author.\n\nShe also texted me about it, and I responded that it was really cool and that I’d buy a copy when I could afford it. I also asked what the story was about, and she told me I’d have to buy it to find out.\n\nLater, my husband saw the cover and was curious if it was AI-generated. I asked my friend who her illustrator was, and she said she’d used Canva AI. Personally, I didn’t really care either way, so I just didn’t reply to that message right away.\n\nA few hours later, she followed up asking why I had asked. I wasn’t on my phone, so I didn’t see it right away. When I didn’t respond again, she sent another message basically saying, “Are you going to reply or not?” I told her I was just curious. I didn’t want to mention that someone else thought it looked like AI, since I felt that would come across as rude.\n\nShe then sent a long message along the lines of, “I already have one friend criticizing my book, and then there’s you—no congratulations, just asking about the artwork as if you’re trying to find something negative. So why don’t you be honest about why you’re asking.”\n\nI replied, “Please calm down. I can’t afford to buy your book right now. When people are proud of something, they usually enjoy talking about it, so I thought asking questions was a way to show I was interested.”\n\nShe didn’t respond after that.\n\nLater, her husband (who I work with) mentioned that she was upset I didn’t congratulate her.\n\nI have no choice but to be at their house soon for an overnight visit, and I’m already dreading any potential awkwardness. \n\nShould I approach her once I'm there or just camp out in the guest room and hole up until the last minute (me and him will have a tight schedule that morning) to avoid any potential conversation?\n\nI genuinely wasn’t trying to downplay her new book—the first thing that came to my mind was to ask questions to show support since I couldn't buy it. But now I’m wondering if I was unintentionally dismissive.\n\nETA- I hope i didn't unintentionally mislead but when i looked back at our texts, I didn't use the word cool, i said the story sounded funny (she marketed it as a hilarious story to read at bedtime and the title has shock value) and maybe that makes it better or worse. I'll just paste the exact text i sent initially in response to her text about the book \n\n\"When I can, I'll totally buy a copy. What's the story? It sounds funny\"",

      "scenario_description": " \nI (late 20s, F) went wedding dress shopping without my mom, and now she says she’s extremely hurt and can’t even look at the photos. I didn’t mean to exclude her, but I’m feeling torn about whether I handled this wrong.\n\nSome background: My mom and I haven’t been emotionally close lately. A few months ago, I told her I felt sad she hadn’t been more involved in planning. My wedding is next fall, but it’s in a city where October is peak wedding season — I’ve already started booking vendors due to limited availability.\n\nWhen I brought this up, she got defensive and told me my wedding was “too far away” to care about and that she had too much going on in her life. That really hurt, and I stopped expecting her to be involved in the near term.\n\nA few months later, I planned a dress shopping trip in my home state during a holiday weekend I was already visiting. I invited my sisters and grandma (who I’m very close to), and we had a great time. I gave my mom about a month’s notice and invited her, knowing her schedule as a flight attendant is rigid and she often needs months to plan time off. She also doesn’t live in my home state. She didn’t ask for alternatives, didn’t seem interested, and didn’t try to make it work — so I assumed she wouldn’t be joining.\n\nI found a dress I love and sent her photos, telling her we missed her. Her reply was cold. When I followed up, she said she was deeply hurt and that having my grandma there was “salt in the wound.” She also said I should’ve prioritized her above everyone else and even suggested I should’ve traveled to her instead.\n\nTo be honest, I did deprioritize her involvement after she said she wasn’t available — emotionally or logistically. I planned around people who had been present and supportive. I also wanted my grandma there — she’s older, and there’s a real chance she may not be around by the wedding, so I wanted to share that moment with her now.\n\nEven after the fact, I told my mom I’d love to have her come with me for accessory shopping or to a final fitting, but she hasn’t responded to that and says the damage is done.\n\nI feel awful she’s hurt, but I also don’t think I acted maliciously. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Mom said my wedding (next fall) was too far away to care about and didn’t try to join my dress shopping trip. I went with family who was available and supportive. Now she’s hurt and says I excluded her. AITA?",

She is foreign and very flirty kissing me all over my face. She tells me I look so young. I tell her how old I am and shes like ahh yeah youre a baby! And then asks me to guess her age. I usually don’t ever engage in that game with women. I genuinely thought she was in her 50s. Drinks had been flowing and I guess I lost my better judgment and I guess (what I think is lowballing) 41. She is shocked and grabs her friend to tell her oh my god she said 41!! She tells me her age. Shes 37. Im mortified. She says “Do I really look that old?!?? I know I have wrinkles!” And I said “Oh god Im so sorry no no youre beautiful” Her friend says “I always say 21 no matter what”. I walk away from that situation feeling uncomfortable and really horrified. The rest of the night that woman and I ignore each other. To be honest, she was a rough looking 37…  I didn’t even think it was that bad to have guessed within 5 years.. I also think like if you look old don’t ask people to play that game. But again, I shouldn’t have even engaged. AITA?",

It’s one thing if you to choose to kiss someone, it’s another if they’re all over you. Maybe in the future consider the motives of anyone pushy and make an excuse to withdraw unless you can tell them to back off cause that kind of person has zero concern for what you want and terrible judgment to be that physical with a complete stranger. Also, say you don’t play the age guessing game as it never ends well.",
