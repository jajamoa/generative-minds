      "scenario_description": "While dog sitting my boyfriend's (m20) dad's two dogs, I (f22) made a joke about how it would be funny if we went upstairs and the big one had his jaw unhinged and the smaller one was halfway in his mouth and they both had a guilty look on their faces like they'd been caught in the middle of something. My boyfriend got upset and defensive and said it wasn't funny to joke about his dogs dying. I made a really bad drawing in paint to better illustrate my comedic vision. He said it still isn't funny and that the joke is just that his dog dies. So I guess am I the asshole for making a joke about my boyfriend's dog eating his other dog? He believes my ego is bruised by him not finding my joke funny but I think he's being weirdly defensive. He agreed to post this. \n\nIdk how to post images here so the drawing is on my profile.",

      "scenario_description": "I really need outside opinions because I don’t know if I am being super unreasonable.\n\nMy mum died when I was a teenager. In her will, she left the house to me but gave my dad a right to live in it until he dies. She inherited our family home from her parents so it was always just in her name.\n\nHonestly I never thought of it as “my house.” Even though legally it is. I moved away for uni but after I got a good job back in our hometown, I moved back in. I have been living here again for a few years now. \n\nI guess I knew deep down that my dad must have dated over the years but he never talked about it and never introduced me to anyone and honestly I kind of liked it that way. I didn't want to know that he moved on. It was just us- him and me against the world.\n\nHis new girlfriend kind of appeared out of nowhere. I met her a couple of times and suddenly she moved in without any prior discussion. \n\nI was stunned but I tried to be happy for him. I really, really did. I tried my best to be polite and keep my resentment to myself. But it’s getting harder every single day. Every time I see them giggling in the kitchen or cuddled up on the sofa my mum picked out, I want to scream. My mum who died too young, who loved my dad, who was only ever with my dad, who never got a chance to move on. And now I have to watch him do it, every single day, in her house, in her childhood home. I didn't know I just feels like this is so disrespectful to my mum's memory.\n\nShe is redecorating. She has moved furniture. She changed the curtains and wallpapers my mum and I picked together and reorganised the kitchen cupboards.\n\nAnd worse she has been making comments like, “Have you ever thought about living independently now that you are settled in your career?” Or telling my dad they will need to turn my room into nursery eventually when they have kids as the third room is his home office.\n\nLike. What?? The absolute audacity.\n\nI’m not a tenant or a guest. I own the goddamn house. My dad just has a right to live here but I don't think that right gives him the right to just move in a partner and act like it’s their shared marital home especially when I live here too. If he wants to build a life with her he should at least move out and not do it in my mum's home.\n\nFrom what i understand she has no legal right to live here. She is not a tenant as she pays no rent. I think I can legally kick her out anytime i want to without a court order. At best she is an \"excluded occupier\" and can be evicted with reasonable notice which is classed as one rental period. And I don't think even that is applicable here.\n\nI havent confronted him yet but I am this close to sitting my dad down and saying all this. And if he refuses, I am considering speaking to a solicitor and making it happen formally. I know it would cause a huge rift but i am so tired of feeling like a stranger in my own home. I feel like my mum is being erased. But I really love my dad and don't want to hurt him or lose him",

      "scenario_description": "Okay so this is probably gonna sound petty to some people but I honestly don’t know anymore and need to hear perspectives from someone on the outside. And I also need to just get this off my chest because I'm still really upset over it.\n\nSo me (22F), my friend Sophia (21F), and our friend Sarah (18F) are all close. Sarah is the youngest of us and just graduated high school this past weekend. She got into our college and we all met her through a mentorship program where older students help incoming freshmen. Over time we got super close and kind of became a little trio. Sarah looks up to us. Especially Sophia. They have like a big sister/little sister thing going on.\n\nSarah invited us both to her high school graduation and was really excited about it. She even told us it would mean a lot if we came since her family situation is a bit rocky and she doesn’t have a ton of support. I moved things around to make sure I could be there. Sophia said she would go.\n\nWell, the day of the graduation rolls around, and Sophia just flat-out doesn't show up. No heads-up, no text, nothing. I assumed something came up. But later that night, she casually posted on her Instagram story that she was watching the new episode of Love Island. Literally with a glass of wine, on her couch, just chillin.\n\nI was fucking pissed. Like I don’t even care if it’s “just high school,” this meant a lot to Sarah. She even texted me after the ceremony saying “hey, is sophia okay? i didn’t see her”. And I didn’t even know what to say.\n\nSo I confronted Sophia in our group chat. I was like, “hey not to be dramatic but that was super shitty of you to ditch Sarah like that she was really looking forward to seeing you there.” Sophia hit back with “omg i didn’t even realize i missed it but honestly it’s just a high school graduation not that deep girlypop lmao.” I said, “it is that deep when you tell someone you’re coming and then flake for a reality tv show”\n\nShe got defensive and said I was being “controlling” and “making a big deal out of nothing” and that “love island is my way of decompressing sorry i didn’t wanna sit through 2 hours of names being called.” I lost it and told her she was being selfish and disrespectful and that maybe she should stop acting like she cares about Sarah if she’s gonna bail the second it’s inconvenient.\n\nNow she’s not speaking to me and called me a “drama queen” to our mutuals. Some of them are on my side and think that it was wrong of Sophia to skip, but others are saying I was a bit too harsh and should’ve just let it go. Sophia has also not apologized to Sarah at all. AITA?\n\n**EDIT:** For those who might be curious, yes it was the Casa Amor episode",

It has become one of her go-to summer jabs. Fine, whatever.\n\nBut I find it ironic how she always wears really open sandals when it’s hot, basically nothing covering her feet. We were recently on vacation in London and walking a lot. We went through a pedestrian tunnel near a train station with a few steps. The whole place reeked of piss and I saw a big puddle of it right in her path.\n\nShe was looking at her phone and walking straight toward it. I noticed what was about to happen and didn’t say anything. I figured it would just touch the soles of her shoes, no big deal. She stepped right into it. She was wearing heeled sandals with very thin soles at the front. The heels kept the back of her feet away but the front of both feet got soaked. It splashed up through the straps and all over her toes.\n\nShe freaked out and got mad at me for not warning her. I told her I didn’t think it was going to be that bad. But yeah, I will admit I saw it coming. And I will also admit I found it kind of funny.\n\nShe said she was on her phone for directions because we were running late and that was my fault. I had made us stop earlier to buy sunscreen because I didn’t want to use hers. It had a flowery scent and I didn’t feel like smelling like lavender all day.\n\nNow she is refusing to help with directions for the rest of the trip even though she is way better at navigating since she is used to it.\n\nI still think it was a little ironic. She always makes comments about my sweaty feet but walks around in shoes that leave her toes totally exposed in a tunnel that smells like a urinal. I didn’t expect her to step that deep in but I thought it would be harmless.\n\nShe says I am immature and petty even though she was the one not looking AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "Hi. So this happened close to a year ago. For some background before I begin, I (15f) and my aunt (70f) were very close when I was young. Once a month, I would go to her house for the weekend and I would get my nails done, my hair done, etc. But as I got older, my aunt started to become a little more annoying to me. She was always getting on my nerves and saying that I had an attitude when I didn't (or I don't hear it). When I graduated from eighth grade, my aunt said she would take me and two friends to Chicago for a few days.\n\nSince my best friends were in seventh grade, I decided to take them since I wouldn't see them as often anymore. We'll call them D (15f) and R (15f). So at the beginning of the trip, everything was fine until the first night. Originally, I was supposed to sleep in the same bed with my aunt and D and R were supposed to share a bed. I didn't want to share a bed with my aunt and D and R said I could share with them. So I was laying between them and before I could get comfortable, my aunt (who I thought was sleeping) told me to get out of their bed and come over to her.\n\nMy friends and I were really confused, but thought nothing of it. So the next morning, I was sitting on the end of my bed when R said to sit between her and D who were sitting with their backs to the headboard. Before I could move, my aunt said that I could only sit on the edge of the bed or we could all sit on the floor. When we asked why, my aunt said that it looked like D was trying to kiss me last night. D and I have been friends since kindergarten and we were just friends. We tried to explain this to my aunt, but she wouldn't have it. Then D and my aunt got into a little argument. D wasn't yelling or cursing or doing anything that I would think that was disrespectful. I think my aunt was being more disrespectful than D. D asked if it was because she was gay and my aunt said \"that sounds right.\"\n\nThe rest of the trip was really awkward and I wouldn't really speak to my aunt. When we got home, my parents got mad at me because they thought that I was just sitting there letting my friend \"talk crazy\" to my aunt. In reality, R and I didn't really know what to do because I really sided with D and I feel like my aunt was way out of line. My aunt and I stopped talking for a while, but we're better now. I don't go to her house anymore, and frankly, I'm glad. But this situation is still in my head and I don't know if I'm in the wrong. AITA?",

Then, on his actual birthday, he wants to go out to dinner at his favorite restaurant (of course, with friends!).\n\nI’m exhausted of entertaining, coordinating, cooking!\n\nHis main birthday gift is a pretty awesome trip, but since we’re leaving two days after his birthday, I don’t think it quite feels like a birthday present to him.\n\nHe wasn’t thrilled with the food at the pool party and said he would had done something else instead. I was very upset because friends helped decorate, someone baked a cake, etc. \n\nI may have said some things in the moment about how much effort everyone was putting in and how entitled he was coming across. \n\nAITA for calling him out as selfish and self-centered?",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for believing that my ex-wife's new husband (her affair partner) should feel morally obligated to pay to support her and our kids while she is living in his house and allow me to stop paying her child support? I have four children with my ex. She had a years long affair with a man while our kids were ages 3-10. She eventually filed for divorce. I was unaware of the affair until right before the divorce was finalized (I suspected but finally found proof). She had been going on trips with him and even going on dates with him and his kids and our kids (he was also married at the time). He divorced his wife just before we got our divorce. Two weeks after our divorce was finalized, she introduced him to our kids as her boyfriend. I ended up having to pay $2000 per month in alimony (for 5 years) and ultimately over $3000 per month in child support while only getting the kids 1/3 of the time. She refused to go 50/50. She just got married to him (it's been almost 5 years since our divorce so she was able to collect almost all of the alimony). But I will still have to pay her over $3000 a month for child support while she is living with her new husband in a house 3 times bigger than mine (I had to sell our family home and move into a condo at the time of our divorce. She came out of the divorce with cash in hand while I ended up around $80k in debt). Am I the asshole for thinking that I shouldn't have had to give her any financial support after the divorce and certainly shouldn't have to give her any now that she is married to her affair partner? Shouldn't he have been the one to take care of her all this time? Especially now that they are married?",

I didn't invite as it was a toddler party with only 5 2-3 year olds. \n\nMy living room isn't very big and I know her son is sensitive to loud noises and thought with all the screaming and fighting it wouldn't be a good idea. He also has to blow out candles even if its not his birthday, which, in my opinion isn't fair and would take focus off my boy.\n\nHe doesn't share toys and, in previous experiences, not even let my son play with his own toys in his own home, and even though the other children were fighting over toys, the parents, including mysel, were stopping snatching and inforcing sharing, even if it caused a tantrum.\n\nI am getting mixed reviews from people around me and I still personally didn't think it would be a good idea but she's made me feel like I was wrong for it.\n\nThank you for all or insights.. \n\nUpdate:-\nSince the party we had a little get together and the 2 toddlers were fighting and screaming about sharing his new toys, constantly trying to stop arguments and the neighbours son came along aswell, when ever the screaming started, it was as I feared the loud noises were too much, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere for the neighbours boy, covering his ears,  sprinting out into the communal gardens, as if he was trying to escape. It started off quietly, but then, as the toddlers got tired, it leveled up gradually. \n",

      "scenario_description": "I (F26) had plans to go down to the shore for the fourth of July with my family. It was planned for 3 weeks and my sister and her boyfriend were coming in from Boston. My partner (M27) recently started a new job and for orientation there was no set schedule. He thought he would have to work on the 4th from 4pm-10pm or not at all. A week ago I let him know if he is off of work I would really like him to join. I had off Friday (4th of July), so planned on driving down Thursday night to spend my day off at the beach. My boyfriend found out at 3pm on Thursday that he would have to work until 4:00pm Friday (4th of July). I let him know I feel horrible about him having to work but I would still be leaving Thursday as originally planned. He is upset and wanted me to stay home on Friday and wait for him to get out of work so that we can drive down together. I didn’t want to spend my holiday waiting around at home and then driving 4-5 hours after to the beach and essentially miss the 4th of July. He was still invited if he wanted to drive down. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I was broken up with this morning. 6 years are over.",

      "scenario_description": "Me (29 F) have been with my partner (33 M) for about a decade now. Although I enjoy the sentiment of a surprise decorated bedroom, flowers, or gift - I absolutely hate surprise parties. Is that too high of an expectation for my partner? \n\nToday is my 29th birthday with the same partner. I am preparing for a very important board examination, of which I am on my 4th attempt out of 5 (everything is riding on this exam), and it is next week. I have been very clear with my partner what kind of support I need from him. I have myself on a strict lock-down schedule of just studying, 1.5 hour afternoon walk, and grocery runs ONLY. It has been this way for the last month. I also have complex-PTSD and live daily with a loud self-critic consciousness (yes, I am seeing a therapist weekly for this and yes, my partner knows this - I debrief with him after every therapy session). We discussed my birthday plans. Since it has been a long time since I have been able to put makeup on and dress up, I was looking forward to my birthday dinner (so much). I picked out an outfit, a makeup look, press-on nails I wanted to wear. I told him, the day before my birthday, I am going to study all day so that I can feel accomplished and enjoy my actual birthday - with no self-hate of not deserving. HE KNOWS THIS.\n\nI am studying peacefully at home as I am waiting for his return. I call him and he immediately starts acting suspicious. At this point, I feel it in my gut that he is planning something. I almost want to tell him PLEASE DON'T HAVE A SURPRISE PARTY... but I don't because I know whatever he is planning, he has already been working on it for the last 3 hours. I already feel bad at this point. We end up going to the brother's house because he \"forgot something\". Ofc, I am grateful but I am also so upset. I ended up wasting the rest of my day surrounded by people who I am not very fond of (his family). I am the surprisee, I can't just say \"ok thank you but I have to go home now.\" - NO. I sit there. Waiting for my partner to wrap it up. He never does. I propose a suggestion: \"Oh remember we were going to go to the mall. Should we go now?\"\n\nToday is my bday. I am triggered to the point where I can't even study. I am so upset, to the point where I no longer have anything nice to say. I have expressed again and again, that I need to LOCK-IN and study but he just keeps playing games, encourages me to play with him. Keeps going out, encourages me to go out with him. I told my therapist I am tired of being stuck, her response is that one day, I am going to wake up and want to change. I want to change. I know he was just trying to make me feel loved but it was so poorly executed and we already had a clear plan. This surprise was last minute (I know because he told me) and poorly executed. I got an ice-cream cake on a flavor I didn't even ask for - AITA!!! I already had a plan to navigate the mean parts of me. I want to bitch at him but I need to hear everyone's thoughts first.",

I traveled there to help him find it, but it turned out to be in a place that the workers would only be able to access the next day. \n\nI knew that my friends that I have known for about two months were going to be there the next day, and since I did not want to travel for an hour and a half to get the phone, I asked them if they would be willing to pick it up for me. \n\nWhen I asked, they said that they will decide when they get there. A couple hours later they texted me asking for details about the phone, but when they were asking about it they seemed very standoffish, and they haven't texted me since to confirm or deny if they got the phone. \n\nWas I out of line to ask them to pick the phone up? I didn't think that it would be too much of a big deal, but their cold behavior is making me think that I might have crossed a line, especially since we haven't known each other for that long. ",
