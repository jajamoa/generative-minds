      "scenario_description": "I (28F) still live at home with my parents. I have moved out in the past for a short periods of time for six months to a year on a couple occasions. But now for the last two years, I have moved back home with my parents to save money.\n\nFor background, my parents have had my location on Life360 since I was 15 years old.. when I turned 19 (still living at home) but was in college I turned off my location and fought them on it for my own independence and privacy, as I was feeling suffocated.\n\nHowever, when I eventually moved out at 22, they asked if I could turn on the location and since I was living far away, and downtown, I turned it on for their concerns of “safety reasons” as I wanted to be accommodating and understanding. But they would always make comments about me going out what I am doing and what time I arrive home, etc..\n\nNow that I have moved back home, I’ve been home for two years about now I am starting to feel suffocated, like I have no independence or freedom to have my own life. Every time I go somewhere and come home late they always like to comment on it. Making smart remarks in front of my extended family at gatherings to call me out. They say it’s for my safety, but I think they are heavily reliant on it and I don’t understand why they can’t just use normal communication methods. They say I don’t share much with them, but they don’t really make it a very welcoming and open environment to do so.\n\nLast night after the family gathering and the smart remarks coming from my Mom taking shots at me in front of everyone, about coming home late the night before. (I was at a friend’s birthday party at their families house, my parents know these people) I needed to clear my head. (We took separate cars) While making my way home I went for a drive and turned off my location. I didn’t get home until about 2:30am\n\nWould I be the asshole? If I kept my location off now. My dad just asked me to turn it back on again, and I am at home. I’m sure my mom will confront me about it later today.\n\nUpdate: \nThanks everyone for there input I appreciate all the responses! \nFor more information I live in Canada, and yes renting and buying a place are both insanely expensive here. \nI moved home to save up so I could buy a place, and not be ‘blowing money on rent’. Although I’m thinking of biting the bullet and renting soon.. \nBut REMINDER They wanted my location when I moved out too!!\n\nAlso my location has now been off since last night. I have been home all day, and my dad has asked me twice to turn it back on. And he is always sweet about it, thats why I end up caving in even though I need the privacy and independence. \n\nHe texted me:\nHi (Name): why is your location sharing paused. It is important to for us to know of your whereabouts because you never know if you are in a ditch and god forbid we couldn’t know where you are located so that it is important to share your location with us.  Just as before please undo the pausing of the location sharing. Thank you love you always, Dad.  \n\n",

      "scenario_description": "Me (35) and him (39) have been together for 17 years. During that time, he's always had trouble with mornings, but used to be able to get up and get into work or whatever else he was doing that day.\n\nOver the past 4 years or so, he's had more and more trouble going to sleep - he's out tinkering in his shop until 2, 3 sometimes 5AM. He's drinking beer every night, though there are times he cuts back to 2-3 beers per night. I mostly quit drinking about a year ago.\n\nSo when it comes time to wake up in the morning, it's a struggle for him. He'll set 3-4 alarms over the course of an hour and a half usually between 9-10, and sleep through all of them. He's super angry when he wakes up whether I have a part in it or not.\n\nWhenever I try to wake him up, it's always one of these things with varying degrees of yelling and aggressiveness:\n-\"I'M SORE I NEED TO LAY HERE\" *falls back asleep for 3 hours* (he does do some manual labor, but seems to have a very slow recovery time and acts like he's sore almost every day and doesn't see this as a problem)\n-\"SHHHH\" *rolls over and goes back to sleep*\n-\"I'M ALREADY AWAKE I'M JUST LAYING HERE\" *falls back asleep*\n-\"YOU'RE NOT HELPING, I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE \" *falls back asleep*\n-\"SHUT THE FUCK UP\"\n\nYou get the idea. I've also tried just leaving him alone and letting him sleep - however I simply just need him to go to work sometimes so his paycheck isn't too small to pay bills. We also own a trailer rental business together and he will sleep through our shared commitments if I don't wake him.\n\nThis week we had a rough week. Lots of problems with the trailer out on rental. He shoveled gravel for 2 days. Life stuff. Hard week. Saturday we both had friend commitments but we agreed Sunday we'd need to wake up at a decent time and make plans for what to accomplish that day and talk about our ongoing financial problems. We agree. We agree on a time-10:30AM.\n\n10:30 rolls around. No alarm from his side of bed. I wait until 10:45 and get out of bed. I make coffee and come back to the room about 11:15 and start cleaning the room. At this point I say a gentle \"Hey\" and try to gently wake him up.\n\nHe says a combination of \"sore/tired/I'm waking up.\"\n\nI continue quietly cleaning the room. He gets mad and yells out that I'm just doing that to torture him. I tell him it feels like he's avoiding the things we need to talk about today.\n\nThis turns into a 1 hour fight where he tells me that he meant to set his alarm, it must not have saved. He also tells me that he is tired and shouldn't have to wake up on a Sunday. The fighting got extremely bad and I'm sobbing and decide this was the last time.\n\nI packed my things and drove 5 hours to my parents' house. I think my marriage is over and I keep thinking, am I the asshole for expecting him to keep his promise to wake up? Or am I just crazy for doing this 1,000+ times?\n",

They used to be close friends and my gf was unfortunately manipulated and done very dirty by the coworker, and it all stems from a relationship with my gf's ex. My coworker is now dating her ex. This coworker has also been horrible to my gf, going so far as to message another one of my gf's exes that she may end up in court with and has spread lies and rumors about my gf. Here's my predicament: as part of my job, i have to talk to this coworker from time to time throughout the day. I have no choice, our jobs are linked. Can't do mine without the coworker. I've tried to cut contact to an absolute minimum but it's impossible to work and have completely zero conversation, and it's of course only work-related. My gf had an issue about a month or so ago because i was visibly stressed and she saw me laugh at a quick joke the coworker made (very in the moment, high-stress job), then walked away quickly to go back to work. I apologized, tried to ease her mind, and we moved on. My gf even admitted she knows there's no way around the issue due to the nature of our jobs, and she also admitted her feelings are irrational. The issue arose again yesterday because she saw me \"talking to\" the coworker again but in reality, it was work related, for all of 6 seconds, and i needed a phone number i knew the coworker had and needed it ASAP. It's caused a pretty big fight. What am i supposed to do? AITA? I can't change how my department works, nor can i avoid her completely 100%. Any advice?",

      "scenario_description": "I 35F was scheduled to go on a camping trip with my older brother his 2 daughters age 12 and 14 and my younger sister in 12 days. My younger sister 30F booked the camping site and we all paid our share to her 101 each. My sister had decided not to bring her dog or invite my younger brother and his 3 young kids ages 2-6 because she did not want to spend her vacation babysitting,she wanted to drink and relax. My older brother and I agreed as we both work high stress jobs and just really need a break. That brings us to today my sister calls me and informs me that my 6 year old niece will be joining us and that we will be baby sitting her for the trip. I am now considering dropping out of the trip for a few reasons, one I feel blindsided that my sister offered to bring our niece along without consulting anyone first. Also I know she did not contact my older brother about this as she knows he would not be okay with taking her. I adore my niece but babysitting her is really taxing she has severe ADHD and is prone to screaming fits when ever she is told no. So I feel that if I go on this trip it will absolutely not be the relaxing trip I have been looking forward to for months.\nWould I be the asshole if I tell my sister I will not be joining them for this trip?\n\nupdate: first of all thank you for the comments. I did want to clear a couple of things up my younger sister does not have any kids and the 6 year old as he is bringing is our youngest brothers kid. Many have pointed out that screaming fits is not a symptom of ADHD and that is correct her ADHD causes her to be hyper and really high energy the temper tantrums are a separate issue. I have not spoken to my sister yet as today is a holiday and I did not want to ruin it for anyone, but today she informed my brother that my niece will not be allowed to bring her tablet as my sister has decided this is a no electronics trip. This is a recipe.for disaster as my niece does not do well on long rides and usually uses her tablet. The ride to the campsite is 3 hours and my sister is expecting my niece to sit quietly. This was a conversation that she made sure to have while my older brother was out of earshot so I will be letting him know what she is planning and will not be going on this trip. My plan is to spend that time at a resort and spa instead",

I’ve been working with my therapist and although I’ve improved a TON, I still drink a little every day. \n\nI’ve never been to AA, as I haven’t found a group that completely cuts out the religious aspect (the southern US, what can ya do) but as I said I’ve worked a LOT with my therapist, so I’m not trying to do this by myself. My friends & family are aware & supportive. \n\nSo, I don’t know if it’s just the shame/guilt/trauma talking, but if I still drink 1-2 drinks almost every day, do I need to disclose this to a stranger that might move into my apartment? \n\nETA: i don’t think I should live with someone who drinks heavily, so I would want to know this info. However it’s very personal so I don’t know if I would be an AH for wanting to know beforehand either? \n\nIt seems like a thin line between being invasive and also being important info for someone you live with to be aware of\n\nETA2: i don’t know how you get diagnosed as an alcoholic other than recognizing unacceptable behavior while drinking. My abusive ex is the only one that ever called me an alcoholic, and I do not take that accusation lightly, so I have been treating my unhealthy habits as addiction. \n\nI have gone 1-2 days without drinking, or even wanting a drink recently. It’s a new development to not want a drink, but I would rather treat this as alcoholism than act like I don’t have a problem at all",

We could not look more different. He's got more than a foot of height on me and probably about the same weight, so he's obviously more visibly fit. He brags a lot about how even after we spend all day chasing kids in the sun, he still goes to the gym for a couple of hours. \n\nThe issue is when it comes to actually having to use strength practically, I out do him every time. I'm not trying to do it intentionally. But when we have to carry 20 kids backpacks and he can only handle 8 while I have 12, or when he can't open a jar, or when we have to lug heavy equipment and he's huffing and puffing while I'm not having a problem, it becomes pretty evident that I am just stronger than him, at least for stuff like that. I'm sure he could out bench me or whatever proper fitness stuff is, and trust me he crushes me when we play sports with the kids, I'm just talking about that kind of work.\n\nThe issue is that the kids have started to pick up on the fact that I am the \"strong counselor\". If they want to be picked up or can't open something in their lunch or want a break from carrying their bag on a hike, they come to me. Apparently, my co-counselor complained to one of the other counselors that I am \"embarrassing\" him because a guy like me shouldn't be able to be stronger than him. That counselor then came to me and told me I should tone it done because it can be hard for someone who prides themself on being an athlete to be worse at something than a guy \"like me\". I said there was no way I was going to do my job worse just to protect hit ego, and the other counselor said I was being a jerk and as the summer goes on the boys might start bullying my co-counselor if they think he's weaker than me, which I don't think is going to happen but I'm not sure. \n\nAITA for not wanting to stop doing my job the way I'm doing it so that I don't hurt this guys feelings?",

      "scenario_description": "I (37F) went on a trip to a foreign country with my husband Joe (33M). This happened in December. We had been married about a year at that point.\n\nThe trip was during the rainy season. I absolutely hate when it rains on me, the way most people hate nails on a chalkboard. I normally quietly put up with it. But spending a week outside in a rainy season, it required a little more planning. But the solution seemed simple: umbrella. But I knew from experience that if Joe didn't have his own, he would grab it, hold it over his head, leaving me almost no protection. So, I said (emphatically) I'll bring an umbrella, but you must have your own. I don't want to share because it doesn't work.\n\nHe didn't bring his own, and didn't want to buy one when we saw one at a market. Near the end of the vacation, we were outside and it started to rain suddenly. I whipped out my umbrella, Joe immediately grabbed it, lifted it high, so it wasn't doing anything for me. Without thinking, I ran over to an open-air restaurant 30 feet away to get out of the rain.\n\nJoe started yelling at me across the distance saying I \"always do this\". He doesn't like explaining himself, so I'm not sure what \"always do this\" means. We rarely go anywhere, so it's not like I have a habit of running off - nowhere to run TO. I was not upset with him in that moment. I understood he grabbed it without thinking. My only thought was to get out of the rain. Everyone in the restaurant stopped talking and looked at us. It was embarrassing (and rude I thought). *Edit: I meant he was rude for disturbing them, not that they were rude.*\n\nLater that night in the hotel we got into a big argument. I said I didn't like him yelling at me in front of everyone. These talks are never constructive. He kept insisting that I was mad at him about the umbrella. I was slightly annoyed after the fact is all, but he didn't believe me. If he hadn't yelled at me, everything should have been fine. The rain died down and we could have resumed our walk no problem. But he kept pressing me and I finally asked why didn't he get his own umbrella if he was going to be upset when I took cover after he basically took mine? He said, and I quote, \"This is why all my friends think I'm pussy-whipped,\" which cut me to the core and I'm second-guessing everything now.\n\nAm I the asshole for how I acted when he grabbed the umbrella? Maybe I shouldn't have gone to cover without saying something first or maybe I should have asked him to try to adjust the umbrella. He doesn't make a habit of yelling at me and doesn't often mad at me, but does get mad when I'm upset with HIM. For my part, he does have a habit of telling me what I'm upset about, when it isn't true, and then being mad at me for what he says I'm upset about. It's like he WANTS me to be mad at him for something unreasonable. But for his part, I know I can be too sensitive.",

I basically visited everyday without issue. \n\nMy mother has returned from her trip, moved back in to my house, taken control of everything again and taken the car back which was said to be mine now... She has also limited me from using the car for much. \n\nEssentially it went from seeing my gf with the car 4 times a week, then to 2 and now she doesn't want me using the car entirely to see her, she complains about funds and wear on the car, yet she doesn't hesitate to let me use it for any other reason, only when I want to see my gf, I also am the only one putting fuel in the car as I use it for work. \n\nMy gf has been nothing more than kind and fun towards my mother, which was good at first but has slowly gotten sour. My mother doesn't even speak to me and constantly gas lights me and says things under her breath(for example, would be nice to have my son home once in a while, when I come back from seeing my gf once in 5 days) \n\nShe always speaks to me like it's such a hassle or bother and only speaking to me now to complain about me.\n\nThis is more of a vent, but opinions and questions are welcome, I'm sure I've unintentionally left a lot out, just what I cna think of on the spot...

How would it be awkward? Unless they make it awkward? I for a certain would NEVER bring any drama upon a child's event! That's my children's family whether I am with their dad or not.

      "scenario_description": "I (20F) live in a flat with 3 other girls. We recently moved in, and everything was fine until I mentioned that I’m planning to start tutoring kids (from our building) at home.\n\nMy dad is going through financial problems and can’t send me money right now, so I really need to earn and support myself. I don’t want to be a burden on him. I haven’t started tutoring yet, but I plan to teach around **8–10 kids** between **5 PM and 7 PM**, either in the **hall or my room**, whichever works best. This is a very normal tuition time in India.\n\nThe issue is, one of my flatmates is against it. She says **5–7 PM is her study time**, and she’ll be disturbed by the noise. She also said she needs to **sleep by 10 PM**. However, we all have **college from 8 AM to 4 PM**, so realistically, most of our free time starts after that—and from what I’ve observed, she doesn’t go to sleep at 10 PM anyway.\n\nI even offered to:\n\n* Let her study wherever she feels comfortable during that time\n* Keep the kids in one area with the door closed\n* Manage the noise as much as possible (though the flat isn’t soundproof)\n\nDespite trying to compromise, she’s completely against the idea.\n\nI understand shared living requires consideration, and I’m trying to be respectful. But I also really need this income and don’t think my request is unreasonable.\n\nWe have 2 rooms and one hall with open kitchen connecting to hall. \n\nSo Reddit—**AITA for wanting to tutor kids at home in the evening even if it might slightly disturb one flatmate?** \n\nA lot of you shared your suggestions and advices. I'm really grateful to you all. \n\nAs of now I'm considering to change in timings for tutoring and making it only one hour **6:30pm-7:30pm**. So that she can study peacefully and don't get disturbed. \n\nWith 5-6 kids at most. \n\nKeeping the environment as quite as possible.\n\n(Also I have noticed while talking to her that she has no problem with the kids if I share my students with her to teach, but I'm really not in favor of it considering I reached out to everyone for tutoring despite being new here and there is a chance I don't get as much kids as expected.) \n\nOn a side note-\n\nThere are no libraries within a radius of 5km.\n\nI can't afford a space as of now. \n\nThere is no common space available in building.\n\nI need to make money to pay my rent aswell. \n\n\n \n\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "So today I (M26) woke up to find that my mom had taken our recently deceased pet dog's stuff that we kept stored away and had given it to my current pet dog. Our family dog of 13 years, Caesar, died of cancer complication last October. At that time my sister and I were away at college so it was just my mom at home, meaning by herself she had to take care of him as his condition worsened and had to take him to be cremated after he passed. We were too poor to give him proper care or have him put down at the time. Our whole family was distraught, especially my sister and I as our Nana had passed away not even 6 months prior. We had agreed to keep Caesar's stuff stored away until my sister and I were able to move out on our own and take some of his stuff with us.\n\nNow while I was in College I ended up taking in another dog, Rusty, because Lubbock, TX is filled with strays and it just sort of happened because the pound refused to take him in. I was lucky enough to have roommates at my apartment who didn't mind me keeping him, that was in 2023. I graduated in December 2024 and I've moved back in with my mom until I'm able to get on my feet. While apprehensive at first, she ultimately agreed to let me bring Rusty home and has grown rather fond of him. \n\nThis morning she gave Rusty Caesar's old food & water bowl, as well as his old doggy bed. My sister is home for the summer and we were both less than happy to find this out. My sister is very conflict averse so didn't push back against my mom very much, I however, confronted her on the issue. My issue isn't really with her giving the stuff to Rusty, it's that she did it without consulting neither my sister or myself. During our argument she got upset saying I was disrespecting her, that she could have just thrown Caesar's stuff away, that I'm not her father, and that she doesn't need to ask our permission to do anything, and accusing me of emotionally manipulating her to force her to take in Rusty. Mind you that while I would have been upset to let Rusty go, I am not so ignorant of our situation that I would have refused to do it and I made sure talk to both her and my dad about it months beforehand. Her argument was that it does not make sense to have dog stuff sitting around and not use it when we have a dog. Rusty already has a bowl and blankets of his own.\n\nAnd as I was writing this, she came in to tell me that I'm being defiant because I didn't put Caesar's bowl back down for Rusty, as well as that neither my sister or I \"run nothing\" here. Also that we're being illogical and she doesn't have to do anything, that she's thinking of Rusty, not ignoring my sister and I's thoughts and feelings, but that I can put the stuff back if I want just not expect any help in taking care of him.\n\nIdt I'm the asshole for wanting my mom to consult with the rest of the family first but maybe maybe I'm wrong, AITA for bringing another dog home in the first place?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "This past weekend my (27F) boyfriend (29M) of 6 years and I went out to the closest grocery store to grab some ingredients to make lunch and dinner for the day. Before leaving, I asked if he had his wallet because we both share a credit account that is dedicated to our food expenses, paid via a shared account that we both contribute equally towards. He confirmed he had the shared credit card, so I declared I wasn't bringing my phone- which usually contains my ID and credit cards. It was the weekend. We were at a grocery store 10 minutes away from home. All I was planning to grab was some fruit and chips. \n\nHe decided to stop by the liquor store first, which is right next to the grocery store. I went in with him. I failed to realize that upon going to the checkout with him, they asked for both of our IDs. I stated I didn't have mine, and the cashier glanced at me and asked for my age. I told her my age, but she apologized and said she couldn't do the sale. I rightfully agreed and apologized to my boyfriend for not having my ID, saying I should have just waited in the car. He was a little upset. \n\nOn the way to the grocery store, he called me weird, suspicious, and immature for not having brought my phone. I told him it's the weekend and I wasn't expecting anyone to call/text me, and that I can live without my phone for an hour. And since I had confirmed he brought his wallet before leaving the house, there was truly no need for me to bring my phone/wallet combo. He stated that it's 2025 and everyone carries a phone- what if we got separated in the grocery store and needed to find each other? I commented that we would find each other eventually, just like I did before I owned a cell phone when I got lost as a 10 year old in a Costco warehouse. \n\nSo, AITA for not carrying my phone on my person all the time?

For example, if she wants the AC turned on, instead of asking someone to turn it on for her, she'll keep repeating things like \"Oh, isn't it super warm in here?\", \"Does anyone else feel really hot?\" or \"I heard that today is a super hot day!\" and if someone asks her if she wants the AC on, she'll reply with \"No, no, I'm good! But if *you're* hot then you should turn it on!\"   \n  \nAnyways, last weekend it was my birthday so my family and I went out to celebrate. During the meal, she kept making comments implying that she wanted another cocktail, but wouldn't order it. The waitress even came by and asked if we needed anything, but she didn't order a drink even when we all did. I could tell she was agitated at that point, but it was my birthday so I just ignored her. \n\nWhen we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we \"let\" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying \"no\" to the waitress because her family should've \"taken care of her\" (her words, not mine). \n\nThe three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.

      "scenario_description": "This is silly, but I wanted some opinions regardless. My brother and I live abroad, and our parents have recently come to visit us and take a vacation at the same time. They are staying at my place since I live alone, and it has been fine other than one issue.\n\nI like to have the AC on while I'm asleep. I just like to wake up to a cool room instead of being possibly sweaty and hot. My dad wakes up every night around 3-4 am to go to the bathroom, and when he does, he also comes into my room and turns off my AC. I have told him multiple times not to do it, as I leave it running on purpose, but he just does it anyway. So found a solution. I put the remote on top of my wardrobe, as he can't reach that high. I did this yesterday, went to sleep, and I got woken up by my dad searching for the remote in the middle of the night. When he saw me, he asked me where the remote was, and I just told him to go back to sleep, and he left.\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, he told me not to hide the remote, so I told him not to turn off the AC, and there was a back and forth, but we quickly dropped it so that mom could eat in peace. So like I said, this is silly, but AITA for hiding the remote.\n\nEDIT: My English is kinda bad, sorry",
