      "scenario_description": "I (25 M), went through my girlfriends (25 F) phone while she was in the shower. We don't live together , but I was visiting her place and she decided to take a shower after the gym. Usually, she takes her phone in the shower to listen to music, but she decided to leave it on the nightstand this time. I noticed that she put her AirPods on top of the phone in a way where she would be able to tell if it was moved. It felt like a test. We do not go through each others phones, but I was tempted. \n\nI trust my girlfriend. I was not looking for anything bad on her phone. But for context, she really struggles with socializing. It's gotten to the point where she's going to therapy for it. She got Bumble BFF as a way to reach out to others and make new friends. But even with the app, I noticed she wasn't making any friends. So while she was in the shower, I went through her Bumble, checked the messages, and matched her up with some girls. I thought I was doing a nice thing. Afterwards, I cleared the tabs and put her phone in the exact position she left it. \n\nThe next day, I told her what I did and she got extremely mad at me. She said that it was, in fact, a test and that I failed by going through her phone. She also said it was a breech of trust to go through that app because it is a very vulnerable side of her that she does not like to share. She never talks about it with me, so I felt like I had to intervene and find out what was going on myself. As her long-term partner, I feel like we should be able to share these things with each other. However, she does not feel that way. She continues to say that I disrespected her boundaries, treated her like a project to fix, broke her trust, and made her feel embarrassed. That was never my intention. I only wanted to help. Am i the asshole?",

We were at a restaurant one evening, they were joking about their motel being terrible, and one cousin joked, “Maybe we’ll just stay at your place instead.”\n\nI just woke up from a nap maybe 10 mins before we got to the restaurant and I jokingly replied, “Sorry, I don’t allow guests in my house. It might be worse than the motel you picked.” I said it sarcastically, thinking we were still joking around.\n\nLater that night, all three sisters pulled me aside and told me to be “more mindful” around their husbands because I might’ve made a bad impression. They said I sounded unaccommodating and told me they were giving advice “as sisters,” even bringing up the loss of my brother.\n\nI felt blindsided. I wasn’t intentionally trying to be rude but I was tired and made a blunt joke. I live alone, I wear hijab, and it’s not appropriate for me to host a mixed group anyway. I thought it was obvious the comment was a joke in response to their joke.\n\nTL;DR: Cousins joked about crashing at my place, I joked back that I don’t allow guests, and later they told me I embarrassed myself in front of their husbands.

Nothing is ever good enough. Or nothing is ever as good as his stuff. \n\nI decided to have a small cookout at my house. He has made comments about its location and quality many times before. Nonetheless, we’re planning to have good food, drinks, and a whole lot of other stuff to spend some time with our friends and relax a little, and they’re both invited. My bestie is worried about her boyfriend’s cat allergies. I have two cats. Both hide when people are over. She asked me to lock them in the room for the day to not upset his allergies. He has been to my house twice now and has never complained about my cats. \n\nI simply told her no. After she persisted, I reminded her he’s been around them, and their fur, which lingers around at all times in the past. I asked what he did then to manage it. She said take Benadryl. I recommend he take it again before/after his visit. She persisted. So I said I’m not locking my cats in a room for the day. And so far that’s been that. \n\nAITA? I’m not sure if my dislike of her boyfriend is clouding my judgement. But I also think of how panicked and uncomfortable my cats will be, and it seems unreasonable to request that from me. Also, their discomfort really doesn’t seem worth his company. I don’t know… AITA??",

      "scenario_description": "AITA for lying to my parents (M&F 50s) about how much money I (F23) make so I don't have to pay them as much for rent?\n\nTo give context after college I moved back into my parents and have been here for 8 months. Since graduating college my parents have taken a sum of my income starting at 20%. After a couples months I was expected to pay the Parent Plus Loan ($510 monthly). A couple more months my car payment was added ($300 monthly). All of this I think is fair and I have no issue with except for the fact I had to quit my job in March.\n\nI was expecting to live in the college area after I graduated but due to outside circumstances I could not get a place. This led to me living home and having a 2 hour commute. After a few months I had to toss in the towel and quit because it was nearly costing money to have the job. During this time my parents had slowly increased my rent to 40% of my income for more expenses. When I was unemployed my parents instead took $200 as well as the loan money (car money was added once I got a new job). This absolutely destroyed my savings to the point I've gained thousands in credit card debt to keep up with life and expenses needed to apply for jobs.\n\nEventually I got a job! This is where I may be an AH but I lied to my parents and hide 40% of my income in an account they can't see. If they question why there's a lack of money I may say I had 20-30% automatically put in savings. I just need to leave this living situation. It's a family of 5 with 2.5 bath, living with family 24/7, limited freedoms, but most importantly feeling a crushing sensation of being trapped here. I understand that my parents have had lives that made them not great with money and there are debts to be paid. In reality paying for loans and my car payment isn't horrible and I expect it. I just keep doing math and see how if I lived with someone I could have a 2 bed 1 bath for the same price. The rent they also say goes to food and electricity (we don't pay for water), so that makes sense a bit. Am I being an AH for hiding the full amount I earn so I can save up to move out?\n\nEDIT: Just adding extra information to clear up some common questions.\n* The total monthly payment is $750 (rent) + $300 (car) + $510 (PPL)\n* I asked for an itemized list of the 40% but I was told it wasn't needed and they said it's what they felt was right.\n* With that I can only assume basic rent, electric, food, and some smaller stuff.\n* I pay for 1/3 of my meals by myself, I pay for my own gas, and car maintenance.\n\nI also can't move out right now due to having very little savings.",

My husband is Jewish and I raised our children to be very in touch with their cultural identity (sent them to Jewish schools and sleepaway camps) but don’t really practice the religion in terms of keeping the Sabbath, following the dietary laws, etc.\n\nOur son is 19 and has, over the past two years, become pretty religious. He spends the Sabbath with friends, which is fine with us. We have tried to compromise on the dietary laws by purchasing kosher meat/poultry for him, not mixing meat and dairy, etc. we live in an area with a large Jewish community and he has cart blanche to use Apple Pay to buy himself whatever food he wants. \n\nBecause I grew up in the community I know the rules and do the best I can for him while not limiting myself to a culture that I chose to leave.\n\nI recently found out from one of my other kids that he is annoyed that we haven’t converted one of our ovens (we have two) into a kosher oven for his use, or purchased separate dishes for him etc.\n\nSibling was like “Did you ask Mom and Dad to do any of this?”\n\nSon was like “no, mom grew up with all of this so she definitely knows what I need and is choosing not to do it.”\n\nSibling pointed out he can’t be mad if he doesn’t ask while ALSO pointing out that Son is 19 and that this is our house and if he’s that pressed he can get his own place and do what he wants.\n\nFact is, I don’t want to. I cook and bake a lot. I like having two ovens. I don’t want to relive the exhaustion of a kosher (semi-kosher) kitchen, though I could.\n\nAITA for not accommodating my son’s religious beliefs to the best of my ability rather than a baseline level?",

      "scenario_description": "Our family has had ups and downs, and recently my cousin D (16F) got to meet her half-sister (20F), who her mother gave up for adoption. D always knew about her, but it wasn’t something openly discussed in the family. I (20M) found out a few years ago but never brought it up—it didn’t feel like my place.\n\nWhen D called to show me she was finally talking to her sister (who reached out after turning 18), I thought it was really cool. She hoped our cousin J (23M) would meet her too. Since I’m close with J, we grew up like brothers, I called him to explain, then added D to the call. He was shocked and confused, saying something like, “Do I have siblings I don’t know about?”\n\nI’ve heard from D’s mom and my dad that J does have a sibling who was put up for adoption, but it was mentioned so casually I assumed he already knew. So when he said that, I hesitated. I wanted to respect boundaries and didn’t want to drop a bombshell, so I joked, “Maybe you should ask your parents,” trying to hint at it without saying too much. But I guess it didn’t sound like a joke to him. He got serious, saying, “You’re messing with me, my parents would have told me.” I replied, “I’ve just heard rumors, man, you should ask your parents.”\n\nWhen we added D to the call, it went downhill. She said something like, “Oh, you have a sibling too, you should meet them.” I didn’t even know it was a full sibling until she mentioned it, I only knew someone existed. I tried to calm things down by saying, “We don’t know for sure, but talk to your parents.”\n\nNow I’m worried about the fallout, especially between my aunts. Some of this was said in confidence, but I also think it’s wrong that J and his sister (21F) weren’t told they had an older sibling. D and I assumed they knew, like we did. I never intended to tell J outright, but I also didn’t want to lie or pretend I knew nothing. D definitely could’ve been more tactful, but she’s 16 and excited.\n\nJ is big on family, and if I were in his shoes, I’d be hurt knowing everyone else knew. He’s 23 and mature enough to handle the truth, but it wasn’t our place to reveal it, after about an hour we got put in a text group and blown up with angry texts. \n\nSo I’m left wondering: AITA? Is D? Are J’s parents? Maybe we all share some blame, but I don’t think any of us had bad intentions. It just got out in the worst way possible.",

      "scenario_description": "My childhood friend (45 m) is a well known couch crasher. He prefers whatever is easy and cheap. If there’s a crappy hostel with dorm beds at $10/night and next door is a clean hotel with single room for $30/night, he’ll pick the hostel every time. He just prefers cheap, easy, simple choices. He'll never splurge for the sake of a better quality product or experience. He’ll enjoy if someone else buys, but it’s not a priority for him.\n\nAs for me (46 M), I’m greatly motivated by quality products and experiences. I often spend an hour researching the best possible version of every day items before buying (nail clipper, usb charging hub, coffee mug). I’m past the point in life of buying cheap and quick versions of things. And when it comes to sleeping arrangements, I care firstly about cleanliness, then comfort and quality, then excellent service.\n\nSo, every couple years my friend and I travel somewhere together. We’ve been doing this since our 20s. When it comes to accommodations and car rentals, I always arrange it because I’m the one who cares about nice things and I know he’ll pick shitty cars and shitty hotels. \n\nFor our latest brocation in a few weeks, we’re meeting in a European city. Two of those nights he had planned for us to crash with a college friend he knows there. I found out and jokingly told him “You might not mind sleeping on couches and scraping cat hairs and cookie crumbs off your face in the morning, but I’ll be in a 5 star hotel nearby.” We laughed it off as usual, but then he took an unusual step. \n\nHe told me couple days later he’d booked an airbnb for us near the other guy’s house. He said “it only has one king bed but it’s cheap and close.” He’s made it clear several times he feels kinda beholden to this other friend and wants to stay with or really near him.\n\nI can only imagine the dirty hovel he must’ve booked. There’s no freaking way I’ll stay in an airbnb he would reserve. I knew his reservation was fully refundable for couple days. So I told him “go ahead & cancel, let me take care of this for us old buddy. I know you want to be near this guy’s house. So I’ll be sure to get something just as close.”\n\nWhen I started my search, I did look only at houses really close by, but the options were pretty mid. I slowly expanded further, finding nicer and cooler spots. I eventually booked a very slick, modern apartment with two full bedrooms and ensuite bathrooms. It has a balcony and view of a river, train station and great restaurants around the corner. Only problem is that it’s fairly far from his friend’s house.\n\nThe place he had originally booked was a 4 minute walk. The place I have for us is 20 minutes via train + walking. I’ll surprise him when we get there. He’s definitely going to enjoy all the amenities. But it’s also definitely further than he’s expecting. \n\nSo, am I an asshole for getting a super sweet place for us that doesn’t meet my friend’s main criteria?",

She got home about an hour or so before I got home from work, we were chatting about what we got up to, she said she hopes I didn't live off takeaway. I said no I made a spicy curry on one night and I put another couple of portions in the freezer, she burst out laughing and saying \"oh no is that what that was, I threw it away\" I thought she was joking at first but from the way she carried on laughing I started to think she meant it, I checked the freezer and it was gone. \n\nI got really angry I called her a b*tch and a c*nt (context, here in the UK that word is thrown around a lot more casually than the US) I kept throwing snide remarks at her over the following hours. She kept saying I should have told her that was mine. Even though I'd told her before she left I was planning on making a spicy curry as she can't handle spicy food and that was my opportunity to have it. And she'd just got home not long before me and found time to do that. I left her really upset and she refused to eat dinner and has been giving me the silent treatment since.",

It has become one of her go-to summer jabs. Fine, whatever.\n\nBut I find it ironic how she always wears really open sandals when it’s hot, basically nothing covering her feet. We were recently on vacation in London and walking a lot. We went through a pedestrian tunnel near a train station with a few steps. The whole place reeked of piss and I saw a big puddle of it right in her path.\n\nShe was looking at her phone and walking straight toward it. I noticed what was about to happen and didn’t say anything. I figured it would just touch the soles of her shoes, no big deal. She stepped right into it. She was wearing heeled sandals with very thin soles at the front. The heels kept the back of her feet away but the front of both feet got soaked. It splashed up through the straps and all over her toes.\n\nShe freaked out and got mad at me for not warning her. I told her I didn’t think it was going to be that bad. But yeah, I will admit I saw it coming. And I will also admit I found it kind of funny.\n\nShe said she was on her phone for directions because we were running late and that was my fault. I had made us stop earlier to buy sunscreen because I didn’t want to use hers. It had a flowery scent and I didn’t feel like smelling like lavender all day.\n\nNow she is refusing to help with directions for the rest of the trip even though she is way better at navigating since she is used to it.\n\nI still think it was a little ironic. She always makes comments about my sweaty feet but walks around in shoes that leave her toes totally exposed in a tunnel that smells like a urinal. I didn’t expect her to step that deep in but I thought it would be harmless.\n\nShe says I am immature and petty even though she was the one not looking AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "This is about me (Cay, TM 23), my wife Bean (Nb 21) , our friend Ginger (m 29) and his fiance Chris (M 41) . \n\nWe are not good friend with Chris but we are best friends with Ginger. We have visited 2 or 3 times before and never been told any specific house rules. We always follow basic rules of respect, and none of these visits Chris has ever tried to hang out with us, electing to sleep or ignore us in another room instead.\n\nThe 2 of them drink Natty Daddy which is a cheap beer sold in our areas. We don't drink it, We wouldn't drink them even if offered. We brought 12 bottles of Seagrams flavored seltzers  for Bean and I to share. My 6 were the same flavors and the other 6 were various flavors Bean wanted to try. \n\nWhen we arrived at Chris' house he was already long asleep and we asked Ginger if we could put our beers in the fridge. Ginger said yes we could  and we were not told (nor did he know) this made them community drinks and we explained in the moment that one pack was mine and the other was Beans. The evening went by fine and then Ginger fell. \n\nGinger hit his face on a mirror and wanted his partner for comfort; cue awake Chris. Around this time I go to bed. \n\nWhen I woke up Bean and I discussed the night before and it was shared that Chris had taken 4 of those variety flavors from Beans package. I asked if he'd had permission or anything and I was told the following:\n\nChris first asked if he could have a mixed drink. Bean said yes and mixed him their apple sparkling water and some straight vodka we ALSO brought.  \n\nHe then went and sat alone in the kitchen. Bean went to the bathroom and noticed then that he had drank 2 of their flavors and said \"ummm actually those were mine\" and he said \"sorry I'll replace them\" and that was that. \n\nLater they noticed he'd drank 2 more of the flavors. Bean ignored it, and just hid the rest of our alcohol, also noticing now that half the vodka had been drank as well. \n\nThe next morning, Bean told Ginger. Ginger was upset and went to Chris to complain that that was rude and he owes us an apology. He got angry; he wanted us to leave and he didn't owe us anything. He then went back to bed and Ginger assured us we could continue to stay the night.\n\nI was on the phone with my friend Raisen (41M, UK) and explained the situation; we both called him a \"theiving c-word\" I know it's more offensive in the US but in the UK it's about as bad as saying b(female dog). I agree with that and its not some magically terrible word. \n\nWell this has got me and Bean banned from future visits.\n\nChris said that if it's in the fridge in his home then he's allowed to just take it. And refuses to replace or apologize and now took to Facebook to call me disrespectful for the name calling and to call my wife and I A-Holes for being upset that he took those flavored beers and Vodka without permission. \n\nHis family all seems to agree and it makes me wonder... Are we really the AH for being upset and wanting an apology? ",

My grandpa is in his 80s, my father wanted bring my grandpa along to travel, my grandpa rarely had the chance to travel, my siste might never had the chance to travel, and she has always wanted to travel to northern china (she rarely had the chance to travel).  my grandpa has been taken care by my sister, they were always togethers, my father hide the fact that we are planning to bring my grandpa and my sister along from my mother. one day, I slipped my mouth and told this fact to my mother,  I was unaware my father is hiding anything, my mother immediately had the angry, frustrated face.\n\n\n\nMy father comes back from home, from medical examination, my mother begin yelled at my father, for hiding the fact that grandpa and sister is going to northern China, she thought that it was only me and my father, that is going to travel to northern China, my father also become frustrated he said that it is none of your business to care about where my grandpa is traveling, and where my sister is traveling. in my mother point of view, she said that she wanted my sister to be with her during her surgery (the surgery isn't life threatening, may only takes few weeks) as a way to relieve her loneliness, however, this raise a problem, since my grandpa is going to travel along, he needed someone to take care of him, my sister lived with him since she was born, it would be best to bring my sister along, but, my mother don't want to. \n\n\n\nWe asked if other family members can be with her during the surgery, she insist no, she said she wanted to see my sister (that would mean there's no one to take care my grandpa). we asked if we can do video call, she insist no, we asked if she can travel along with us, and do the surgery, in northern china, still no.\n\n\n\nAITA for not going to my mother's surgery?",

      "scenario_description": "So my friend (M20yrs) has been obsessed with working at the Casino for a while now. We live in a somewhat small city and the Casino here (at least in my opinion) isn’t that great compared to some other big city casinos. Apart from cash/car draws, poker machines and table games there’s not really much to it. \nAnyways he’s been absolutely obsessed with working there for years since he stepped foot in it when he turned eighteen and he’s applied for a position there almost as soon as there’s one available however he’s never gotten hired. \nEvery time we go to the casino - which is like once or twice a week he’ll bring up the fact that they’re understaffed and they should hire him and that he can be a dealer if they just hired him or something to that effect. It’s honestly gotten to the point where it’s just annoying and pisses me off every time he brings it up because if they wanted to hire you, they would have already!\n\nSo as just a bit of a joke I decided to prank call him and tell him that a position had recently become available and that the casino would like him to come in for an interview @1pm the following day 😂.  \nMind you I made this call from a pay phone @9:20pm at night and I had an American accent going as well - we live in Australia. \n\nAlmost five minutes after he got off the phone with me he called our other friend (M20yrs) to tell him he had gotten an interview at the casino and he was so excited about - I mean he was ecstatic, jumping for joy that he was finally getting his “dream job”. \n\nThe other friend was in on the prank and hinted that maybe someone was prank calling him and maybe he should check with me (F21yrs) if I was the one pranking him because nobody else knows about his obsession with working at the casino besides us🙄. \n\nLong story short, I pulled his leg for a little bit then ended up confessing that it was me who made the prank call. To my surprise he was actually quite devastated (there was no life behind the response he gave me) that he didn’t actually get an interview which made me feel bad because I only intended for it to be a harmless prank 😬. \n\nAnyways I was debating with the friend who was in on it and he keeps telling me it’s just a harmless joke and that our friend will be fine but I just want to get some other opinions. \n\nSo, AITA for pranking him?\n\nEDIT: Upon reflection, I decided to show my friend this post, as well as all of your responses and he said it's not that deep 💀\n",

      "post_title": "AITA For Wishing My Fiancée Had Communicated With Me Prior to Agreeing to Host In-Laws",
      "scenario_description": "I have a situation that may seem minor, but I’d still like an outside perspective. My fiancée (23F) and I (23M) deeply value communication and transparency, though we sometimes fall short. Her birthday is coming up in two and a half weeks, and today we had our first detailed conversation about it. Coincidentally, my summer vacation lands right before her birthday (for two weeks), and I planned to take her actual birthday off too.\n\nThe issue is a classic one: in-laws visiting. She let me know that her mother will be staying with us for five days (ending on her birthday), her father for three, and her grandparents for two. These plans were made without consulting me. I immediately felt “off” about it—not because I dislike her family (I love them and enjoy their company), but because of the length and lack of communication. I couldn’t help but view it hypocritically: in the past, she’s been very clear that my three siblings shouldn’t stay longer than three days. I understood and respected that boundary.\n\nI’m someone who struggles with mental health and needs space to recharge. The only people I can be around without stress are my fiancée and siblings. Her mom, while lovely, is high-energy and very ADHD—traits that often clash with my anxious and introverted nature. It’s not a matter of liking or disliking anyone; it’s about mental stamina.\n\nWhen I told her that five days felt long, she didn’t seem to acknowledge my feelings. I then expressed that I wished she had discussed it with me first. I said I’d prefer if her mom could stay for just three days. She replied that it wouldn’t be appropriate to change the plans now, as it would be rude to her mother. I brought up the precedent with my siblings—how we had communicated and compromised—but she said the situations weren’t comparable. Her view is that my siblings are teens/preteens who want to spend time with her, while her mom is there primarily for her. I agreed they aren’t identical, but still felt the broader point stood: extended houseguests increase stress, especially in our small home.\n\nThe conversation began to stall. I made one final plea to shorten her mom’s stay, and she said that since it’s her birthday, I should “meet her in the middle.” I pointed out that nothing had changed—there had been no compromise or middle ground—so I’d essentially just be ignoring my own needs. She reiterated that the plans were made and she wouldn’t change them. At that point, I felt frustrated and emotionally drained, and I went to another room to cool off and type this post.\n\nI realize this isn’t a massive issue—five days is not weeks or months—but I still feel frustrated, unseen, and confused. I’m open to being wrong here, or to having overlooked her perspective in the way I feel she overlooked mine. I just want some outside input on what feels like a trivial matter from the outside, but is a real source of emotional tension from where I’m sitting. Thank you.\n",

My mom asked me to share my location with her a while back and I declined saying that it's just my boundary and I don't want to. We argued for a bit and then dropped the topic. My sister was sharing her location with my mom but stopped sharing it with her last week and my mom exploded and got so mad. She told us that we don't need to drive her to work anymore and that we basically don't have to do anything for her. We moved past that and still drove her and picked her up, thinking that we moved on. Today my sister asked if she can take the car just to run an errand. My mom said if she turns on her location then she can use it. My sister nicely said, \"it's okay then, I can walk there.\" This comment made my mom so mad and she said she can't believe that my sister would rather walk instead of sharing her location. So clearly my mom just wants the location just to be in control rather than using it for safety like she says. Later, I came down and talked to my mom and my sister was there. I was telling her that I don't understand why she has to take something away from us (not using the car) just because we're not comfortable sharing it with her. By the way, I barely ever use the car, I don't need it, but the principle of it all just bothered me. She threw it back in my face that I share my location with my friends and that she has the right to take something away from us because we are not being good daughters. This hurt because my sister and I try our best with making her happy, helping her around the house, etc. She told my sister and I that her relationship with us has changed after our reluctance sharing our location with her. Honestly, I'm so appalled at the way she is acting. She has never asked me to share my location when I was teenager and now it's a whole big thing. We have such a good relationship but I feel like I saw a different side of her. There's no middle ground that we can agree on. So AITA and should just turn it on for her? ",

      "scenario_description": "I, 51F am a mother of 2 kids, 18f and 14f. My 14 year old daughter has been asking me all summer if she can hang out with a few friends of hers, let's say Peter, Micheal, and Jamal, that I have not met. Normally I'm okay with with her hanging out with her friends, dont even need to meet the parents so I said sure. Since Peter lives about a 48 minute drive from us, I told her I wasnt up to driving her there and back to pick her up all in one day, so she suggested a sleepover.  She had already told me Peter was a guy, so I instantly shutted the idea down and said she was too young for it, and obviously her being a kid she got upset. She had been asking me and my husband all summer to go places like the mallz skate factory,  a skateboard park, etc yet me and my husband didn't feel like driving anywhere so we said no or maybe later. last night, we had gotten into a little hefty debate on why it was or wasnt such a big deal. She had gotten a little \"emotional\" and shouted a bit that I was overthinking the entire thing, and that I was acting like she was going to \"go over there and come back pregnant\", and that shes known Peter for 2 years and she knew how to act. She said that it wasnt going to just be her and Peter, 2 other of their friends and Peter's mom was going to make them have the door open the entire time so there wasnt anything that I needed to be worrying about. I tried telling her that it wasnt that simple and I even had problems with my 18 year old spending the night at her boyfriend's house. I stated that she could be mad if she wanted, but the answer would still be no. She rolled her eyes and stormed off, and now I'm currently getting the silent treatment from her. She hasnt been out of her room all day, and havent been answering my texts when I asked her if she wanted food or if she wanted to watch a movie. AITA?\n\n  \nedit: wow. Didn't expect to get as much hate as I did, but since a lot of you have some questions I'll just answer the ones that were frequently asked.\n\n1. How does she know this kid and why does he live so far away?\n\nI honestly have no clue how she met this kid. my daughter is very big on me and my husband not meeting her friends, only their parents. never asked why and I don't plan too.\n\n  \n2. Why can't you just drive her? \n\nMostly because I don't want to, but because I have a lot of health issues. I'm  CNA nurse who recently just injured my knee working with a patient.  I had to use a crutch for a few days but stopped to get use to the feeling so I could get back to work. The only places I drive are work, and back home.\n\n3. Does your oldest daughter have a license?\n\nYes she does. my oldest is 18 and she currently drives, but she doesn't have a car.\n\n4.  Is this kid your youngest's boyfriend?\n\nno he's not. my daughter already has a boyfriend who me and my husband have been planning to meet, Peter and her are just friends. And according to her, if I knew what Peter looked like I'd know she would never date him.\n\n5. Why can't ou text Peter's mom?\n\nI'm not a big people person. My daughter has been begging me to talk to Peter's mom, Tiffeny, because she thinks I won't are about her and Peter having a sleepover if I actually got to know his family. I always tell her I will later but I don't plan on texting anyone. \n\nI know it may seem like my husband and I are lazy, but we're not. We're both hardworking people who just like to come home and relax and not have to drive around all the time. ",

      "scenario_description": "Last year my (23F) mom (53F) unexpectedly died. My dad (55M) hasn't worked in 10+ years. He's very \"my way or the highway\", always fought with everyone, and rarely spent time with us except to discipline. My mom did everything - worked, cleaned, cooked. Dad mostly sat had his computer all day, watching YouTube and playing games. \n\nI have 3 brothers: one older (25M), and two younger (18M & 16M). The oldest finished college 2 years ago, is still unemployed and blames companies for not hiring him. In reality, he doesn't want to work. He spends most of his days like our dad, on his laptop playing games and listening to podcasts. When mom passed, my dad was super disoriented. He didn't know how to cook or do laundry. My younger brothers and I got jobs during the summer. I worked in a supermarket while looking for jobs in my field. September came and my dad told my older brother and I to move back to the capital (where we went to college) to find work. \n\nI ended up getting a job in my hometown in February and started living at home again. My dad asked me to help, so I paid half the rent for the apartment in the capital. But my dad got worse. He'd say I need to be in bed by 9:30 and not see my friends during the week. I didn't listen, but I'd worry about being out late. Fights became frequent (my dad is very stubborn and controlling). \n\nWhile helping my best friend and her brother look for a rental, it became clear I needed to move out too. We found a cheap 3BR near my work. I told my older brother, and he was furious, calling me selfish and saying this was the worst time to leave. I still offered to continue paying half the rent. I told my dad I was moving out - he laughed, said I'd fail, and compared me to the prodigal son. I asked if I could come back if things didn't work out - he said he wasn't sure. I hugged him goodbye, but he was cold. \n\nAfter moving out, I had a dentist appointment at the same time as my younger sibling. My grandpa (dad's dad) gave me a ride. When my dad and brother arrived, my dad immediately got upset that I had \"used\" my grandpa - he told me I had no right to ask for help from my family because I abandoned them. He yelled. \"What do you want from us?\" My older brother also thinks I'm selfish. He talks to my younger siblings about it - one of them now believes it too, while the youngest is split in the middle. I still try to see them and reach out, but my older brother only ever messages me when it's time to send my half of the rent. (example of the message: \"rent is {insert amount}\").\n\nMy dad hasn't spoken to me since I left. When I came by to get the rest of my things, he ignored me, and wouldn't look me in the eye. I feel so much guilt. My friends say I did the right thing, but I still have a hard time believing it. I feel like it's all my fault that everything went wrong and if I didn't do it, the family wouldn't have fallen apart. \n\nSo, AITA for moving out? ",

      "scenario_description": "I (17M) and my friend (18F) were planning to hangout yesterday. When yesterday came however, I woke up 2 hours before we were supposed to go out and I offered to reschedule for the next day, to which she was positive about and agreed.\n\nHowever, the next day (today), when I went to see her at a location we agreed on, she wasn't there. I called her about 6 times and I was genuinely worried that something went wrong.\n\nAt around 8PM, she messaged me and she seemed unconcerned. I told her I was waiting for her and she was clueless about everything we discussed. I explained to her that it was better for me to go out with her today rather than yesterday, as I learned last minute that my friend group wanted to hangout, hence why I offered to reschedule, to which, again, she was very positive about. She got mad at me for that explanation and insisted I prioritised my friends over her.\n\nWhile I understand where she comes from, I still don't understand which she would switch her mood just a day later. I even tried to apologize for trying to reschedule, but she said that she doesn't trust me in regards to hanging out again and I don't know how to move forwards with her in terms of our friendship.\n\nTL, DR: I rescheduled a hangout with my friend for the next day, acts clueless about said rescheduling and gets mad at me about it.\n\nUPDATE: I apologize to everyone who has read the post as I didn't provide all the necessary information due to my stomach sickness.\n\nSaid friend and my friend group are completely unrelated. There were no plans of a relationship from either side. While I rescheduled our plans, she was the one to suggest it because I woke up really late and I rescheduled with her knowing I had other plans.Also, to answer someone's question, this is the first time as far as I'm aware that I showed unreliability.\nI apologize for any possible conflicts with previous information. I was more focused on my stomach sickness and didn't think properly about the post itself like I should have.",

      "scenario_description": "For context, I (18f) spent time with friends at one of their houses. We were chilling, having a good time, until everyone wanted to leave around 11:30 pm. I volunteered to drive some of my friends home as it was something I frequently did. Since I drive my friends often, I have some simple rules in the car to prevent us from getting hurt or in trouble. The most important rule to this story is to have the seatbelt on, especially at night. \n\nOne of the friends I usually drive with (let’s call him Friend #1, 18m) said he would be coming with and of course I had no problem with it. He knew the rules of being inside my car and normally rides shotgun. In the past, I’ve had to talk to him multiple times about the rules in my car as he didn’t have the best track record with them. Since then, he has been fine, but recently has been violating my rules. I’ve let it slide.\n\nFast forward to when me, Friends #1, #2, and #3 get into the car and start driving. #1 is in the backseat with #2, and #3 is in shotgun. On the way to #2’s house, we pass by a cop that was parked on the side of the road. #2 mentions he didn’t have his seatbelt on. I sternly told him to put it on, but tried to laugh it off to prevent an awkward moment. I hadn’t been friends with him for long, so he was still getting accustomed to me and my car. A few seconds later, I can hear #2 telling #1 to put on his seatbelt too. When I hear this, I start to get irritated. #1 should know better than anyone to have his seatbelt on, as he’s been driving with me since I got my learner’s permit at 15.\n\nI start complaining to #1 about putting his seatbelt on and emphasized that I didn’t want to be pulled over for something minor and get in trouble. He puts it on and responded by saying that he didn’t know the rules applied to him when in the backseat. This started a back and forth, which partially stopped as #3 turned up the music to tune out #1. I took the dial and turned it up more. When the music was progressively getting louder, I hear #1 saying that I’m turning the music up because I couldn’t admit that I was in the wrong.\n\nI turn the music down and start to get audibly upset. We start going back and forth again. I kept telling him over and over again that he should’ve known better and to not be upset that he’s getting called out for it. He starts yelling back, saying a bunch of hurtful things. I then tell him to get out. If he didn’t want to follow simple ground rules and disrespect me in my own car, he can leave. \n\nAnd that’s exactly what happened. I pulled over to let him out. We both said some hurtful things, but he took it too far. He slammed my door, and I drove away. \n\nWe haven’t spoken since. I think the best thing for right now is distance. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. \n\nIn the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. \n\nI am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. \n\nThey’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. \n\nYesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. \n\nI had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. \n\nMy kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. \n\nBut afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. \n\nSo AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",

A group of my son’s friends are going away and when I told him that I booked it, he immediately said “I can’t take off, is everyone going?” At the time maybe two or three of the fathers weren’t going because they had to work, so he said ok, I can’t take off, have fun. Fast forward to a week before the trip  and I find out that in fact those fathers took off and are going. I didn’t say anything to my husband because I know he wouldn’t have taken off work with a week to go. He finds out and is now irate with me for not telling him that “everyone” is going and he’s now not and that I didn’t give him the option and have a conversation with him. His reason is “do you know how this makes me look?” We got into a huge argument and I told him if he wanted to have gone it should have been because he wanted to take a family trip and not because everyone is going.

      "scenario_description": "My partner and I have been together for 6yrs, and were bestfriends even before that, and we don’t fight—sometimes we get upset, but never yell and have always talked it out and resolved things well. I am the primary breadwinner, the one who generally handles big or regular purchases, the planner, the big-gift and gestures person, the one who does more of the cleaning, and pretty much the only one who cooks. My partner does most of the dishes, helps me dye my hair, and does nearly all of the driving and most of the car related things for us (but not everything—I brought our car into the relationship, and pay for most of the stuff, my partner is just usually the one to run to the DMV if we need to update things because they don’t work during normal business hours most of the time), because I hate driving, and has for basically the whole time we’ve been together.\n\nAt different times, with our changing jobs and commutes over the years, they have either been the one to drive me to or pick me up from work. They have previously had a work from home job and currently work 2 to 4 days a week for less than 8 hour shifts, and I work 40hrs a week in an office. I appreciated the rides because it always saved me either time or money or both, and also meant I got to see more of them on any given day. In the last year they haven’t wanted to drive me consistently anymore. I was fine with them only doing it two days a week, even, because I get that it eats up their time and I don’t mind mostly using public transit, but now they don’t want to do it at all. I didn’t argue or pressure them to continue, but after a while of the new routine they said (because I don’t wake them to drive me anymore) it makes them sad I don’t wake them up to talk and say hi and bye in the morning. I told them it makes me sad they can’t be bothered to be up regularly and spend the time with me/do the favor of driving me, and we didn’t talk about it anymore. \n\nRecently, they messed up requesting time off to be able to visit family in another state for a grad party, so I had to buy last minute train tickets and go by myself. I was disappointed, but aware mistakes happen. I asked them to charge their portable charger and let me borrow it for the trip (reminding them 3 different days after they said I could), which they still forgot, and to pick me up from the train station when I got home after the trip, which despite having my itinerary and me reminding them of my eta, they were a half an hour late to do. I explained that I was frustrated and felt uncared for since they didn’t want to drive anymore, and made these mistakes back to back, and they proceeded to tell me they talked to their therapist the day I left about driving and she thinks it’s crazy that my partner drives me, that I’m entitled, and they should set a hard boundary about not doing it anymore, which, frankly, left me hurt and stunned. Usually we resolve and move on from stuff, easy, but I don’t know what to do about this. AITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "This is such a stupid thing to even talk about but whatever.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend \"Dan\" (M27) and I (F25) both work full time. Dan and his friends (4 guys, all late 20s) all work from home, and they like to meet up and hang out when they work. Great! Happy for them! They'll rotate between their houses, meeting up for lunch and kind of extending that into a post-work hangout.\n\nThe thing is, all of his friends live alone. Dan & I live together. One of my biggest pet peeves is having random people in my house when I get home from work. I hate it so much-- I just wanna take my shoes off and relax and I can't do that if there's four dudes that I don't really know in my living room and kitchen.\n\nI spoke to Dan about potentially removing our house from the rotation, or at least taking his friends out around the time I get home. He said that was controlling, which maybe it is. He also said it wouldn't be fair for them to host every week and for him to just skate by.\n\nI get that! I do! But I feel like I'm a variable that isn't being accounted for here. Honestly I'm conflicted here, so I figured I'd ask: am I an asshole for not wanting my boyfriend's friends over when I get home?\n\nEDIT for more info, from a couple questions (& comments) I've seen:\n\n- The guys come over once a week usually. Sometimes twice a week. They come over at lunchtime (noon ish), and they're there until usually 7PM or so. I get home at 5:30 ish.\n\n- I do not want or expect my bf to stop hanging out with his friends, nor am I expecting him to break up with me for this. I didn't lecture or yell at him or anything, we had a regular conversation about this.\n\n- The guys themselves are not creepy or weird or anything. I'm just tired after work and I like being able to unwind, and part of that (for me at least) is the comfort of knowing I don't have guests around.\n\n- I can't avoid them that much-- our apartment is an open floor plan & the only bathroom is in our bedroom, so there's always *some* level of interaction.",

      "scenario_description": "Hi. I'm an early 20s bartender currently moving out of my family home. This month has been extra long shifts, training new staff, and moving everything I own. I work late evenings and nights, usually 7 hours but some shifts lately have been 10. I have a genetic disorder called Fabry's disease that makes falling+staying asleep harder, you lose energy quicker, and your body needs more recovery time. All this to say when I woke up this morning at 11 (I'd planned to sleep till 12:30) to my mom and her fiance's loud talking and slamming doors and cabinets, I didn't feel too good. I waited for half an hour hoping it would die down, no such luck.\n\nI walked out into the kitchen, bleary-eyed, irritable, full body soreness, and I pleaded my case for hushed voices for 1 more hour. My soon-to-be stepdad said \"welcome to adulthood\", an unhelpful comment in any scenario, and my mom pulled me aside to say they had decided on an impromptu BBQ (something that surprised me since that's never occurred before in my 20+ years of living), and to get over it. She brushed me off, and I felt pretty shitty about the whole interaction. Here's where it starts to get dicey and I do something I'm not proud of. I slam my own door shut, to show how loud and unpleasant it is. \n\nNow my mom starts texting me. She says no one I live with is ever gonna care if I'm sleeping, and that I'm selfish. Yesterday I had confided in her that I'm struggling greatly with loneliness because everyone around me is partnered and my last partner was abusive. She says \"you're selfish, you only care about you, this is why you're alone and no one loves you.\" She said no one can stand to be around me and no decent person would tolerate my \"poor me\" attitude. She said \"good luck finding someone, princess.\" It was devastating to read. It was the most vulnerable spot she could've hit me in. I blocked her after that and then unblocked her 10 minutes later when I felt guilty. We haven't talked more than that. \n\nI've talked to a few friends today about what happened, they say she's not right about me and I've not been selfish with them but I don't know. I'm too shaken and I haven't been able to stop crying more than a few minutes. I feel way too raw to think clearly, I really think what she said was way too intense for that situation but she could have a point about me, she could see something my friends don't. I don't know how I'll face her cuz I'll definitely start to cry and she could take that as confirmation that I'm a spoiled brat. I don't know what to do anymore man. ",

      "scenario_description": "I (26 M) and my fiancée (28 F) are set to get married within the next year, while we were making our invitations we came across an issue, one of her friends we will call her Emily, has the worst boyfriend in the world. He’s insanely rude, a complete misogynist, and all around deadbeat. In the first year of our relationship Emily would call us all the time complaining about (we will call him Rick) saying that he would stalk her at every bar, and do a bunch of weird shit, and almost like an African wild dog (they hunt by wearing down their prey), eventually I guess he wore her out until they started dating??? ANYWAYS in that time I said A LOT of things about Rick before they went out together, which has even caused that Emily excludes me from all events involving my fiancées friend group, it’s never been confirmed but I’m sure it has to do with my well known hatred of Rick.\n\nAnyways things came to a head when making the invitations, I said that absolutely he’s not coming to our wedding, and that I didn’t care, which then prompted my fiancée to be panicking due to her friend groups dynamic. She told me that if this were to go through it would cause Emily to not come at all which would potentially cause even more drama with her friend group which would lead to potentially to a situation that would ruin the wedding.\n\nFor context, everyone hates Rick all her friends do but they don’t tell her that to Emily’s face, Rick was found to have compiled suggestive pictures of some of Emily’s friends in a file in his phone, people gave restraining orders against that man, he humiliates Emily publicly for amusement, and constantly argues with other people in that friend group. He makes women uncomfortable and my entire family is only women, and my 2 daughters.\n\nThe last thing I would want is for my fiancée to feel uneasy at her own wedding but I don’t feel comfortable having Rick around.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting Rick at my wedding?\n\n(Adding detail, her friends aren’t the ones with retraining orders, and yes the explicit pictures were nudes he had collected via a local Reddit thread he made to obtain them from their exes, also African wild dogs hunt by wearing down their prey I had not realized how it looked until someone pointed it out! My bad sincerely!)",

      "scenario_description": "My (36, M) sister (34, F) moved into my house about 2 months ago with her 2 kids (7M, 4F) after she ended a really bad relationship\n\nI’ve always been an early-ish riser and like to get up and make myself some breakfast around 7 or 8am. Nothing spectacular, just whatever I felt like that day\n\nWhen my sister moved in, I realized quickly that she liked to sleep in. Some days she was up as late as 1pm…I gave her the benefit of the doubt since I knew how hard her break up was for her \n\n\nSince my sister slept so late daily, she wouldn’t get up and take care of her kids. I got into a routine with my niece and nephew that basically whatever I cooked myself for breakfast, I’d make enough for them as well until the other morning \n\nI woke up and had an urge to make huevos rancheros. The kids immediately started complaining that they didn’t want that and wanted something different\n\nI was nice and ended up making them pancakes since it’s not their fault that their mom is really struggling \n\nThe next morning, I was making breakfast potatoes and eggs but all I heard was “we don’t want that. We want something different” so again, I obliged…finally after 3 mornings of my unwanted food critics getting a separate meal, I finally told them “I’m no longer cooking 2 different meals for breakfast. If you don’t like what I’m making, go ask your mom to get up and do it”\n\nSo, they went upstairs to wake her up, but she still didn’t come downstairs until after 1pm. The kids immediately started complaining that I “refused to feed them” and my sister was PISSED\n\nShe started in about how they need to be fed by a certain time and a bunch of other things that she said to try and intentionally hurt me\n\nI snapped and told her “look I know you’re depressed, but wake up and take care of your fu**ing kids instead of expecting me to do it”\n\nShe got quiet after that and is still giving me the cold shoulder, but I know she’s expecting me to apologize.\n\nSorry this was long winded, but let me have it. AITA?\n\n",

      "scenario_description": "\nI (M26) am living with my long term best friend (A, M25), and our mutual friend/their partner (B, F25), and promised a couple years ago that I wouldn't move out if they couldn't find someone to replace me. Now I want to move out, and our tenancy is up for renewal, but they haven't made any effort in the past 4-5 months to find someone except for one of our friends (C, M26), who I'm worried won't be accepted by the landlord. They waited months to fill in the necessary forms, and even if they hadn't just lost their job, they probably didn't earn enough to be approved. There is another person (D, M19) in our close-knit group who would want to move in, but my housemates don't want that because of his age.\n\nLiving here is so bad for my mental health, my friends barely help with the cleaning, smoke weed and cigarettes in the house, and will spill the ash trays and not even clean them up properly, they leave takeaway boxes out for days, leave food in the sink, wet clothes in the washing machine, and they constantly play loud music/movies until 1-3AM in our small retirement community-esque neighbourhood. I tried so so hard for the first couple years to just keep the place clean but it's honestly impossible with how messy they are, especially with my health issues. I felt really pressured and expected to do this just because I wasn't working, but now that neither of them are working either I'm realising that they just don't clean, and don't care about the mess. If I want to live in a clean home I have to do it all myself, but that just isn't fair or sustainable. I've talked to them about this multiple times and nothing changes. They also just can't take care or adult responsibilities, like essential phone calls (I've had to make their Universal Credit phone calls and submit evidence for them), responding to emails from the landlord, cleaning for house inspections, etc. etc., so I'm just taking on so much responsibility.\n\nI just want to move out of here, and in with my partner, but I feel so trapped because I can't just make my friends homeless by not renewing the tenancy. They don't seem to see any issue with any of this, and don't have any sense of urgency even with our tenancy agreement ending in 6 weeks, and basically just have the attitude of \"well I guess you can't move out then\". Am I the asshole for being angry and hurt over this? Would I be the asshole if I just didn't sign the tenancy agreement, despite my promise?",

It’s just a preference of mine and I’m not going to tell my mom and friend’s wife to call me by my shortened name. It’s not an insecurity of mine either, I just would prefer if my partner called me by my shortened name. The arguments caused over this have been ridiculous. I think my girlfriend is feeling like I’m giving other people extra permissions to call me something that I don’t her I’d rather not be called by and it’s upsetting her. I don’t think she’s understanding where it’s coming from. Maybe I should just drop it and let her call me whatever since it’s becoming an issue since I brought it up. AITA?\n\nTLDR; I told my(32m) gf(29f) I’d prefer to be called by my shortened first name, but she says it’s not right of me to ask that since other people call me by my full name. It’s a preference of mine since she’s my partner. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "So backstory: I'm from the UK, but moved to the US when I married my spouse. We have kids and my parents are very keen to have a relationship with them. My parents are still \"together\" but don't get on, so they refuse to come at the same time as each other.\n\nSince I moved over here my parents have stayed here for around a month EACH every year. We do have the space in the house but I still am never comfortable when they're here. My parents are very high strung people and I did not have a pleasant upbringing, I was always on edge and I do not feel comfortable around them. They don't get on with each other and for example my dad (who is staying for a MONTH) expects to borrow a vehicle to be able to get around (we live in a very rural area). And was very irritated this morning because the car's battery died and I refused to let him take my car.\n\nEvery time I broach the subject of them not staying here any more they say things like \"you're going to bar me from seeing my grandkids?\" This is more of an issue with my mother than my father. As she's more vocal. Or the fact that it was me who decided to move 5000 miles away and therefore I need to accommodate their needs. They stated they can't afford an air BnB (no hotels in the area).\n\nI DO live in a very rural area with no real amenities apart from a few air BnBs. So their argument is that if they cannot stay with me then they are barred from all contact.\n\nWhen they're here they expect me to feed them, and cater to them. My dad is a type 1 diabetic and is very set in his ways so he is very picky. They expect it because they're my parents. I don't visit my home country very often and so have rarely stayed with them and would 100% get a hotel if it was the other way round.\n\nI am just exhausted. They say it's only a few months a year and they are there to \"help\" but taking my kids to the park 3 times a week and doing the dishwasher every day isn't the help I want or need. I just want to keep my routine and feel safe and comfortable within my own home.\n\nETA: I do have a fairly massive house with a lot of empty space (not fancy, but large as my husbands a builder) which is the main reason I think that my parents are so frustrated at my action. And why i am receiving backlash if I ask friends around me if I’m being unreasonable. ",

      "scenario_description": "This girl and I have dated on and off for close to a decade now. We've tried to make things work 4 or 5 times but it never seems to last. Our most recent breakup was about 6 months ago after dating for around 6 months. Before that we hadn't spoken in years. \n\nShe was living with her girlfriend for the last couple of years but they broke up and let their lease expire. They both moved out of their appartment a month ago. My ex decided to buy a bus instead of moving in with her family and she intends to live in it with her son. Right now it's not really set up to live in so she needs to do some work to it. I agreed to let her stay with me for a short time while she sets it up. \n\nMy house is 3,700 square feet and has several bedrooms. I primarily stay in 2 rooms. My bedroom and an attached game room. When she came here I told her I wanted her to stay in the downstairs bedroom but she put up a fight until I caved and let her stay in my gaming room. She was sleeping on a mattress on the floor and her son was sleeping on my couch. The mattress made it very difficult to get in and out of the room. I had told her to stay in the other bedroom 3 times but she always had a reason why she couldn't. The most recent one was that she didn't feel safe. She thinks there's some kind of supernatural creature in my back yard or something.\n\nShe also has a cat and had his entire set up in this room. Food, water and litter box. I have 2 cats but her cat bullies mine so we try to keep them separate. My cats usually come up in to the game room with me and sleep with me at night but they couldn't because her cat was locked in the room with us. \n\nToday I had a bad day at work and came home grumpy. All I wanted was some alone time but her and her son were sitting in my game room like they always are. I told them they needed to find somewhere else to go and they can't sleep there anymore. I helped her set up a bed in the downstairs bedroom. I wasn't exactly nice but I didn't yell at them or anything. Now she's mad at me and saying I didn't need to be an asshole about this. Im like 90% sure Im not but something is nagging at me. So am I the asshole?",

      "scenario_description": "I bought a second-hand game console online and asked a friend to collect it for me. He paid the seller on my behalf when picking it up, but didn’t check the item. Only two days later when he passed it to me, I found out the screen was damaged.\nAt that point, the seller refuse to take any responsibility since payment was already made and the item had left their hands.\n\nNow I feel like my friend should take responsibility for not checking the item before paying - especially since the damage was so obvious. If I had been there myself, I would’ve inspected it before handing over any money. I trusted him to at least give it a quick look.\n\nI feel bad because my friend was just trying to help me out. I haven’t asked him to cover the cost yet, but I’m leaning toward expecting him to pay in full. If someone picks up and pays for an item on your behalf, shouldn’t they be responsible for making sure it’s in acceptable condition?\n\n\nEdit:  Ok, I see many people are saying ITA, which I can accept. But some said I tried to set him up to blame him, and that feels a bit much. As I did ask him to check the item, and honestly, I wouldn’t have blamed him if it was a small or hard-to-spot issue. But the screen damage is quite obvious.\nIt’s not that I don’t appreciate his help—but since he agreed to help, I think it’s fair to expect he’d at least make sure the thing was working properly.",
