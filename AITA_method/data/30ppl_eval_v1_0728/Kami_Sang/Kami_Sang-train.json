      "scenario_description": "AITA**?**\n\nWe legally keep four beehives in our \\~0.5-acre forested backyard (full lot is an ~acre), fully compliant with all state and county ordinances and regulations.\n\nInitially, we kept two decorative hives in the front yard —the hives themselves were designed to look like little green-roofed houses. A neighbor we’ve known for years asked us to move them to the backyard, expressing concern that the bees were “biting” the fish in her koi pond. While bees don’t bite fish, we relocated the hives to the backyard out of consideration for her concern.\n\nA few years later, another neighbor—whose property backs up to ours from the adjoining subdivision—began complaining that our bees are \"a danger and a nuisance\" and are interfering with his enjoyment of his swimming pool.\n\nIn response, we relocated the hives to the far side of our backyard and added more water sources to keep the bees hydrated closer to home. Unfortunately, he says this hasn’t helped. Apparently, the bees are still visiting his decorative stone waterfall feature, which flows into the pool. The waterfall is not intended for use by people—it's purely ornamental—but the shallow water and accessible ledges make it an ideal spot for bees to drink. This is despite the fact that there’s dense vegetation between our yards, and in spring/summer we can’t even see his property because of all the trees and shrubs.\n\nThe bee families we keep were selected by my father, an experienced beekeeper, specifically for their gentle temperament. Despite having a toddler who plays barefoot on our clover-covered lawn almost daily, he’s never been stung. In the nearly ten years we’ve had the hives, I’ve only been stung once—by what may not even have been a bee (it flew away after getting tangled in my hair).\n\nWhen the neighbor first complained, the very first thing I asked was whether he or anyone in his household is allergic to bee stings. He said no. In my view, that would be the *only* truly valid reason to consider removing the hives. I want to be respectful of my neighbors, but I also feel strongly about property rights and environmental stewardship. \n\nWhat’s hard to swallow is that many of these same neighbors regularly use harmful herbicides (even on windy days, their landscape company just sprays it weekly), synthetic fragrances, and other substances known to be detrimental to human health—including causing brain cancer in  kids. And yet I’ve never asked anyone to change what they do on their land.\n\nWhy should I be pressured to remove *bees*, which are beneficial to the ecosystem and even offer medicinal benefits (bee venom, for example, is used therapeutically)?Now the neighbor is again asking me to relocate the bees, offering to cover part of the cost. But the truth is: I don’t really have anywhere else to put them, and honestly—I don’t want to.",

      "scenario_description": "My sister is in the ICU, over the last 2 days she has gone downhill very quickly. Her daughter (18) my niece does not want to see her mother. She visited her briefly but does not want to go back.\nWhen we were leaving the hospital after a quick visit my other sister started berating my niece telling her that she was \"making it all about herself\" simply because she didn't want to stay any longer. She kept telling her that she owed her mom her support and that it was selfish to leave and not stay. I told her that being upset and scared about your hospitalized parent is not selfish and *niece does not have to visit if she does not feel up to it. This of course led to my sister getting mad at me and *niece so I just took my niece home. Later another one of my sisters called niece and I could here her on the phone while niece is crying telling her that her mom needs her strength and that she needs to put aside her feelings and be there for her no matter what because she deserves it. She wasn't even trying to let my niece explain why she didn't want to see her just kept trying to guilt trip her. After they heard that I told niece she did not have to go both of them are on an \"anti-me\" strike.\nMy sister(hospitalized) has done the bare minimum for her kids,my niece and nephew. when my niece got too difficult she packed her up and dropped her off at my house and she stayed for two years. When my niece was going to fail high-school I was the one on the computer and the phone going through the classes with her and helping her figure everything out. My sister has never provided a bed or a roof or food it's always been people taking them in and she gets benefits so she's never had to work. She screams at her kids over everything and is just an all around poor mother. I do not feel bad about saying that. Regardless off how good or bad a parent is, I don't think children owe even good parents anything much less the bad ones.\nI will ALWAYS prioritize my nieces and nephews wellbeing over my siblings but I also wonder if my pushing that she doesn't have to see her mom if she doesn't want to is being just as manipulative as them trying to force her to see her. So AITA?",

Over the years, she's \"borrowed\" money from me (on a family trip, I think I paid for a large group expense and she didn't pay me back $400 for like months). I gave her furniture for her apartment that my wife and I no longer were using. I had to pick it back up again when she didn't need it anymore and it was really inconvenient. She's about 25, about 6 years my junior. I honestly like her but her behavior is really immature and selfish sometimes. \n\nShe was having issues with her VW ( it breaks down a lot and she gets ripped off by mechanics often). I've changed the lights on it at least once (her now fiance doesn't even ATTEMPT do do easy DIY jobs that most people could do). \n\nAnyways, I am an electromechanical tech and a pretty good one, that stuff is pretty easy for me. The part that got me is that she thinks because I can do it, it's like my job or something. She's asked me to do her brakes for like $50 and a case of beer. I said no politely (I hate doing brakes, that's not my hobby lady!). She seems to have no concept of value. \n\nAnyways, I still have tried to help her a bit. Her windshield wiper motor was on the Fritz. I told her it's not hard to replace, buy the part and bring it over and me and her can look at it. This was summer I believe. \n\nShe waits until the dead of winter (and I now have a 3 month old baby). The windshield wiper motor finally totally dies and she basically can't drive it. I tell her to come on a fairly warm day and I specifically said bring her fiancé and he can learn a thing or two. Reason being is I don't want to be doing stuff like this for them if they aren't going to at least attempt it themselves. \n\nDay comes, she didn't even tell her fiancé. I send him some texts along the lines of \"are you too busy for this?\" He says he doesn't appreciate that and that he has a secret Santa with his frat brothers that he's planned forever. He tells me that he doesn't need me to do this and just that I could \"be that friend\" who helps them. \n\nWe kindve get into it over the phone as I tell him this is more his problem than mine. He spins it saying he \"trusts Jane can handle her problems and is not controlling like that\". I tell him she's not solving it...she's bring it to me. He gets mad and says his friend who's a mechanic can do it. I still expect Jane to come but she doesn't, her and fiancé get into a fight over this and have their friend do it (who fails and it's still broken). I wind up apologizing to just smooth things over and my wife doesn't really take my side 100%. \n\nShe winds up having her step dad do it. I never even said don't come over. \n\nAITA or am I dealing with a bunch of babies?",

      "scenario_description": "I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. \n\nIn the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. \n\nI am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. \n\nThey’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. \n\nYesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. \n\nI had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. \n\nMy kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. \n\nBut afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. \n\nSo AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",

It's another all together to decide to take on a graduate degree while working and having a family.\n\nTo me it seems you did thag for you - you hit a ceiling. However, if your husband and kids are not onboard I just want you to know that your aggression is what they will remember.\n\nYes, you have a full plate but that is optional. Family first esp when you have kids - can you honestly say you're doing that? Your kids won't care if you get a masters if it comes at sacrificing time with them and loading them up with chores.\n\nAs the Mom there's your own fair share of chores to do.  You said it can't all be done and it sounds like you're sacrificing family over work and study.\n\nAs someone who has been there and seen it -  you don't do a grad degree with kids unless you have family support.\n\nI want to urge you to consider your attitude to your kids because it seems like you made a sudden change that in their minds may be selfish of you.  Whether you're right or wrong, suddenly offloading alot of chores on your kids that they never had before because you want to study is negatively going to affect them.\n\nSo you need to think - highly educated and break the ceiling at the expense of your kids because you're not managing it well...is it worth it?\n\nHaving been there I fully get that it is tough but don't sacrifice your relationship with your kids for a degree.  Your attitude will make or break this.  How you communicate, thanking them, finding time for thrm.  You're still Mom whether or not you want to break a ceiling.\n\nAlso, you set the tone of chores in the house and that won't change overnight because want a degree.  I think the problem here is poor change management.  You want to break that glass ceiling? Leadership starts at home.",

      "scenario_description": "I (45 F) am hosting a 50th birthday party for my husband in a few weeks. We have decided not to invite any children other than our own for cost reasons. We have 2 kids (10 M and 7 F). I have a cousin “Amelia” who is a single parent of an 11 month old baby. Amelia asked if her baby can come to the party and I said no because it wouldn’t be fair to the other guests who also have kids, including our own nieces and nephews. \n\nSome important background: over a year ago Amelia had a baby shower in which she invited myself and my daughter and all the other girl cousins but did not invite any boys so my son wasn’t invited. My son is neurodivergent and does not understand nuance like that so we asked my aunt (Amelia’s mom) who was hosting the shower and she made an exception for my son to come. \n\nI sent the invitations for the party about two weeks ago and Amelia called me up a few days later and said she wasn’t sure if she’d be allowed to bring her daughter. Her daughter’s father is not in the picture and neither is his family and since her parents and siblings will be attending our party, she doesn’t have a sitter. She also brought up the fact that she’s still breastfeeding and really doesn’t leave her daughter for more than a few hours. Her baby will be just about a year old at the time of the party. I told her that she could not bring her baby and explained that it wouldn’t be fair to the other guests, most of whom also have kids. She said she understands that logic and that’s why she didn’t invite boys to her shower, because many of her friends have sons and she only wanted it to be kids in the family. She brought up that her mom made an exception for me and that she understands if I can’t let her daughter come but that she will not be in attendance. My cousin is the oldest “grandchild” in his family and the oldest of our friend group so many of our friends and family members also have babies. A few are younger than Amelia’s daughter but aren’t breastfeeding and I don’t want them to feel left out because I let Amelia’s baby come and not theirs. We really do not want a million kids running around. \n\nI was telling my mom about this and she is giving me a hard time. She said it won’t cost anything because Amelia’s baby won’t have her own plate and that breastfeeding moms are different. She feels bad because Amelia is a single mom. She also feels embarrassed that I asked for an exception and won’t give one in return. I am feeling a little hurt that everybody in the family is giving me a hard time and I’m just wondering if I’m the asshole for not making an exception when I asked for one for my own child? ",

This had caused some problems with her family, they didn't like him spending all this money on her because she's unemployed and has problems keeping a job. So he buys her takeout, snakcks and random little gifts. And things her parents won't pay for, like her pet food and her tampons. They say she has to pay for this stuff herself.\n\nFor a few months, they had seperated them and made her focus on her career instead of socializing.\n\nToday, they got to meet up and hoped to reconcile. But he can't buy her anything else. They went to wal-mart, he had a birthday a few weeks back so they wanted her to buy him a gift, she didn't get him one. He said it's because he doesn't know what to ask for, because of her finances, the long gap between their last meeting, he's also never been big on gifts as he got older. So they just spent the day with each other and her family. Her mom got onto her about this. About how she takes gifts but can't give them\n\nAfter spending the day with her family, they brought him home.\n\nI don't know exactly what was said, his gf called us in tears and told us her mom said \"she was using him and leading him on and just with him for money\" and that \"She saw your house\", implying that she shouldn't borrow money from him because she saw where we live. We live in a mobile home that's pretty old, it's functional and has everything (Water, power, etc.), it's just small and looks rough on the outside.\n\nThey didn't directly mock or disparage where we lived but it gives me the impression that they're looking down on us because we don't live in a fancy 2 story home in a subdivision. My son doesn't think they were looking down on us and that it's just the money borrowing, but i personally do find it insulting.\n\nAnd this really upset me because i am proud of my home, it's a family heirloom and i am grateful to have a home at all.\n\nWIBTA if i tell her she's coming off as a snob?",

They didn't raise her to be a taker and they feel she is taking advantage of your son.  BTW I think so too.  She sounds like someone who's waiting around for a man to financially mind her and she's unwilling to make any effort for herself.\n\nSo they are trying to implement some tough love.\n\nRe your home - they're not looking down on you at all.  They're literally saying we raised you with more than your BF was raised with (wh8ch can simply be factual) and yet you are taking from him.  Instead of you using the platform we gave you to do well instead you're happy to take from someone who came from less and who could probably use the money for other things.\n\nThey probably appreciate your son but hate their daughter taking advantage.  I personally can't imagine at 21 expecting a man to buy me tampons.  I will aslo say if I had a 21 yo kid unwilling to work my attitude would be - I'll provide you with a roof over your head and you can eat what you cook but you better figure out your other expenses.\n\nI'd also think my own child was taking advantage if tge way they figure it out is for a bf/gf to give them $ or buy them things.  I understand her parents - she's just pissing them off.  It's not about your son or your home.\n\nThey probably also feel ashamed - your son's making strides and their daughter is just taking or in their mind being a user.",

      "scenario_description": "I (47 female) and my ex husband (49 male) share joint custody of our two children. Our eldest child is 19 and she is autistic and has ADHD. Last night was my ex husbands night with the kids and I had a date. My eldest daughter became ill before I went out with sickness and diarrhoea. I.e. very bad. Can’t even keep water down and in a lot of pain. We’ve all been there it’s horrible. I was literally dress up ready to go out but she was so poorly and she asked me to stay with her. The reason she asked me to stay was that in previous occasions her Dad has pretty much left her to her own devices when she’s ill. The same with her 17 year old sister. So I sat with her till well after an hour since I should have been out. Getting her medicines and just being company. During this time my ex husbands had sat downstairs on his computer game. After over an hour I admit I lost my temper (with my ex not my daughter) and I came downstairs for some water for myself. As I stormed back upstairs he said “I’ll give it to her” first time he’s even mentioned her. Bear in mind this is supposed to be his time. When I said to him that he hadn’t even bothered with her he got furious and stated “she’s 19 for gods sake” stating that at her age she basically needs to fed for herself. He then shouted at me as I was going upstairs “was I going or what?!”\nI cancelled my plans. I slept on the floor of my daughter’s bedroom as my ex refused to leave the house as it’s his night. (We leave the kids at the main house and we leave it when it’s not our time there)\nMy ex is angry because according to him I mollycoddle the kids and I should have just left. I’ve had hardly any sleep and I would like to go out again tonight but my daughter is still ill and panicking about me going and I can’t leave my kids when they’re asking for me even if they are 19. Am I the asshole for looking after my sick 19 year old kid when they’re asking asked me to? ",

You get sick at 19, you deal with it - as did every single other 19yo I know.  \n\nIf it's a serious illness or surgery related etc that's different.\n\nSo I'll say ESH  at 19 you can handle being ill and having diarrhea.  Sure, it's nice to have someone coddle you but I don't think ex was wrong for his attitude.\n\nAlso - if our kid is 19 and you're my ex - fuck off please.  I don't need you telling me how to interact with my adult child.  That's now my daughter and I's business.  \n\nNow given she is autistic - it would depend on how severe it is. That might be my only reason for the nta.\n\nFinally, OP you don't have a right to stay in the home if it's not your parenting time.  That is his time and you're imposing the way you desire to parent on him when your child is an adult.  This is very problematic.",

      "scenario_description": "I (30F) am engaged to my fiancé John (30M). His family spends a lot of time together—holidays, weekends, and frequent get-togethers with all the siblings and grandkids.\n\nJohn’s dad retired this past May, and we already had a retirement party for him. Now his parents have planned a family vacation in November to celebrate his retirement again. They rented a large house out of state and invited everyone—siblings, spouses, grandkids, etc.—for a full week: Saturday to Saturday.\n\nJohn and I were clear from the beginning that we probably wouldn’t stay the entire time. I’ve always expressed that Thanksgiving is an important holiday for me to spend with my own family, and John told his parents early on that he wasn’t sure we’d stay the full week because it was a long trip. We decided we’d attend the trip from Saturday through Wednesday, then head home so we could spend Thanksgiving with my family.\n\nSince then, there’s been some subtle pushback. His parents have said things like, “It’s just one Thanksgiving,” or asked if John could stay even if I left. They’ve also said this is the first time the whole family is doing a trip like this in years and it might not happen again.\n\nI understand they’re excited about the trip, and we’re not trying to skip it—we’re planning to be there for five full days. But I don’t think it’s fair to expect every adult to give up a full week of their own time and holiday plans, especially when we made our intentions clear up front.\n\nAITA for not wanting to stay the full week, even if it’s disappointing to his parents?\n\nEdit: Many people asked about the \"subtle pushback\" It was subtle as in they are communicating with John. His mom blew up when they asked about booking flights and he said yep our plan is to come Saturday to Wednesday to get back to OP's family for Thanksgiving since it's important to her.\n\nShe went off saying \"it's just one\" \"she can't miss just one\" and \"can't you just stay\"? Then he left that conversation upset and we got in an argument about holding the boundary because he is a peacekeeper and tends to people please.\n\nThen a couple weeks later they asked him to come for dinner and both his mom and dad pressed more saying \"it's just one\" \"can't you just stay\" and then they told him \"he needs to advocate for himself.\"\n\nHe was great about all of this. He held the boundary and told them this is a WE decision and that this is what WE are comfortable with. He told them he doesn't want to be away from his fiance on the holiday.",

I met her a couple of times and suddenly she moved in without any prior discussion. \n\nI was stunned but I tried to be happy for him. I really, really did. I tried my best to be polite and keep my resentment to myself. But it’s getting harder every single day. Every time I see them giggling in the kitchen or cuddled up on the sofa my mum picked out, I want to scream. My mum who died too young, who loved my dad, who was only ever with my dad, who never got a chance to move on. And now I have to watch him do it, every single day, in her house, in her childhood home. I didn't know I just feels like this is so disrespectful to my mum's memory.\n\nShe is redecorating. She has moved furniture. She changed the curtains and wallpapers my mum and I picked together and reorganised the kitchen cupboards.\n\nAnd worse she has been making comments like, “Have you ever thought about living independently now that you are settled in your career?” Or telling my dad they will need to turn my room into nursery eventually when they have kids as the third room is his home office.\n\nLike. What?? The absolute audacity.\n\nI’m not a tenant or a guest. I own the goddamn house. My dad just has a right to live here but I don't think that right gives him the right to just move in a partner and act like it’s their shared marital home especially when I live here too. If he wants to build a life with her he should at least move out and not do it in my mum's home.\n\nFrom what i understand she has no legal right to live here. She is not a tenant as she pays no rent. I think I can legally kick her out anytime i want to without a court order. At best she is an \"excluded occupier\" and can be evicted with reasonable notice which is classed as one rental period. And I don't think even that is applicable here.\n\nI havent confronted him yet but I am this close to sitting my dad down and saying all this. And if he refuses, I am considering speaking to a solicitor and making it happen formally. I know it would cause a huge rift but i am so tired of feeling like a stranger in my own home. I feel like my mum is being erased. But I really love my dad and don't want to hurt him or lose him",

      "scenario_description": "EDITED TO CLARIFY. \nMy husband (35m) and I (33f) are expecting our second child this summer. We have the c section date schedule, so like, it’s coming soon.. soon soon. With our first, my MIL stayed at our house to care for our three dogs and a cat while we were in the hospital having the first baby, also by c section. We were there 3 nights. This go around we still have the same house, same pets (minus two dogs, RIP the good boy and girl) add a toddler and are planning on leaving a day earlier since we have a better idea of what we’re doing. Initially she was game to stay at our house with our toddler (2.5m) and our pets, and she already took off work those days to be here…so we didn’t make any other plans. Now speaking with her. She’s trying to convince us that she needs to stay at her house with our toddler and we can just take the dog somewhere and we can pick both up the day we come home. I told my husband absolutely not. If that’s the game, then we will find some other family member who will either watch both at their house or who will stay here for both. We’re not even asking her to stay all day.. and the toddler goes to day care during the day. We’re just looking for someone to be here in the evenings for the dog to have company and be taken care of twice a day and so the toddler can stay in his house and routine. It’s literally two nights unless something goes wrong. AITA? \n\nAdditional info:\nDog is DOG reactive. Loves people. No bite history. No other dogs around. Only has health issues when severely stressed, but none for a while. Couch potato dog. \n\nMIL was happy to agree to this in November when  asked. Confirmed it again sometime in April, still happy to help and stay at our house. When told the date of c section, in 3 weeks, changed her mind while on the phone. We mentioned having FIL (they’re divorced) watch both. She doesn’t want that only wants GC. \n\nMILs house is not childproofed. No gates for steps and a dog that HAS bit toddler. Plus 3 cats that have also bit and scratched toddler. \n",

What you asked of her - to leave her home and spend days at yours is unreasonable imo.  I fully understand her not wanting to do it.  She has her own home, she can take care of your kid in her place and she's not up for your pet care.  She also did it before and it's clear she's not up to doing it again.\n\nI hate your attitude that it's literally 2 nights as if it's not an imposition on her and she wouldn't be doing you a favour.\n\nBy all means get someone else....",

      "scenario_description": "I (37M) have a 4 year old son with whom I see every other weekend. I plan to propose to my GF of 3 years this fall. I have most of the details mapped out (nice hotel for the weekend on the water, hire a photographer, plan for this to be a surprise) and when putting the plan together I felt I wouldn’t be able to pull this off on a weekend I have him. Especially considering the surprise aspect; she would definitely pick up on the oddity of me planning a romantic weekend getaway on a weekend I have with my son. Of course, I plan to have him there for the wedding, but felt it wasn’t necessary for the proposal. To clarify, it’s not that I don’t want him there I am obsessed with my son, but it would be near impossible to pull off the proposal I was planning on my weekend ‘on’ with him.\n\n My sister, on the other hand, thinks its trashy and would be a bad look if I did the proposal on my weekend I don’t have him.\n\n I personally feel not having him there when I propose isn’t that big of deal; mainly because he’s 4 and has no concept of what a proposal/engagement is. I would agree it would be a bigger deal if I had my wedding on a weekend without him.\n\n Perhaps I’m wrong and I should just change my proposal to something less elaborate and do it on my weekend with him.. Looking for some opinions on whether or not AITA!",

      "scenario_description": "My friend (22M) recently started dating a girl from Brazil while he lives in the U.S. He doesn’t make much, just minimum wage, and saves what he can for pilot school. He’s very frugal but not cheap, especially with people he loves. He’ll tell you he’s selfish, but as someone who’s known him closely, I can say he’s one of the most giving people I’ve met.\n\nHe’s now madly in love with this girl. So much so, he’s considering dropping everything to move to Brazil, maybe work there, and be with her. She’s studying to become a doctor. At first, she said her family was financially well off, but later admitted they weren’t. Initially, she didn’t want to leave Brazil. Now she’s talking about moving to the U.S. with him after marriage.\n\nImportant to note my friend is very Christian, saving intimacy for marriage, even no kissing.\n\nWhen he visited her in Brazil, she apparently sat him down and said, “as a man i expect you to provide for me financially. I expect you to pay for everything when we go out, and take care of my needs.” For me, my red flag alarms were blaring. I know my friend. He already does everything he can to take on that traditional provider role. He pays when he can, he gives generously, and he never brags about it. So for her to say that explicitly felt transactional.\n\nI shared my thoughts with him, maybe a bit too bluntly: “That sounds unnecessary and borderline transactional. Why did she feel the need to say that?” He responded, “Well, you know I’m selfish, right? My girlfriend is basically fixing me.” I know for a fact that is 100% inaccurate, because I know my friend is not selfish at all. In fact he is the least selfish guy i have known. He’s always offering to pay for food and there have been times he has gone above and beyond not just for me but also other people in our friend group. Politically, we disagree (he leans right, I lean left), and I’m not white, but he’s always treated me with deep love and respect. He’s always had enough reasons to show selfishness but not once has he done it. On the contrary he has supported me in ways I never asked for, both emotionally and financially.\n\nHe is however, frugal. Buying from clearance isles, never using uber, never buying things he doesnt need, maybe saying things like “i can totally make that at home” when we are all at a restaurant. Its a running joke at this point, not a whole negative personality trait.\n\nI told him, “When you love someone, you’re not checking boxes. You just want to be with them. The fact she laid out a list of her demands like that doesn’t sit right with me.” I could see his face turn pale. I instantly regretted saying it because he genuinely seems happy with her.\n\nThis is his first serious relationship. I wonder if that’s clouding his view or making him tolerate things he wouldn’t otherwise. Maybe I overstepped. But as someone who cares deeply for him, it’s hard to stay silent when something feels off.\n\nCurious what you all think. Did I cross a line, or was I right to say something?",

      "scenario_description": "I (26F) recently moved back to my hometown for a job. Because it is only for a year and the job doesn’t pay well enough to afford a place of my own I have been living with my parents for the past months. I can work partially remotely but have to be at the office 2 days a week. The commute is is 1,5 hours each way with public transport, so 3 hours a day plus delays usually (Germany) and it has been wearing me down for the past months.\n\n\n\nAt some point, my sister (28F) offered me to stay at her apartment for free on the days that I was going to the office, which would cut the commute down by half. She hasn’t been living in her apartment for close to a year now and living with her boyfriend full-time so she told me that me staying there would be no problem. In the beginning she told me that she was planning on keeping her place for the rest of the year because her and her boyfriend were looking for a new place to move in together but didn’t have the time or energy for a big move right now and that her furniture wouldn’t fit into their current place. When I asked about paying her rent she told it was fine because she had to keep the place for the rest of the year either way. \n\n\n\nIt’s been a few weeks now of me going to her apartment every Sunday night and leaving Wednesday morning. I bring everything I need for the days and only keep a few items of clothing there just in case. I make sure to leave the place clean and don’t touch her things. The place is also very small with basically just a kitchen, a table and a couch to sleep on.\n\n\n\nNow she’s suddenly pressuring me to pay a third of the rent arguing that she is providing me a “mostly furnished apartment” to use whenever I want and that because of me she couldn’t live there now. I would be fine with paying her something of course but even the days that I am using the apartment I am out of the house most of the day and basically just have dinner and go to bed so a third doesn’t sound fair to me. AITA for not paying a third of her rent?",

      "scenario_description": "Our wedding budget allowed us to not have to worry about limiting the amount of guests (within reason).\n\nMy best friend at the time. and groomsman, Russell (not real name), had a girlfriend (Shannon) who no one liked. Everyone was around her only because Russell is a great guy, perfect gentleman, etc. He's the kind of guy that is so nice, and everyone wants him to be happy, and find a good woman, and have a good life. Shannon, on the other hand was very negative, toxic, and people thought she was a little weird (not in a good way). There are many stories of her just being rude, a party  pooper, and I later found out saying bad opinions about us. These comments would surface on Facebook, through some games we play in friend groups, and through talking behind our backs.\n\nBasically, Shannon was rude and a \"you must be fun at parties\" type of person. The part that was hard for me was that while Shannon was so negative and toxic, and judgemental (Christian-type judgemental), Russell was so good and happy. I felt like I was supposed to tell him that his gf sucks, but who am I to tell a happy man something negative.\n\nSo when it came time to send out invites, I felt like I was at a crossroads with inviting Shannon or not. Many friends and even family have expressed their concern with sitting at the same table as Shannon. Then my fiance (now wife) requested that Shannon not be invited, and that was it, I sent Russell one without a plus one. He didn't know, but he was the only person with a significant other who didn't get a plus one on his invite. Am I going to go into my wedding/marriage upsetting my best friend, or am I going into it upsetting my wife, and close friends?\n\nThe wedding day came, and I left a seat open for him, and understandably, he didn't show up. I wasn't mad about it, and I understood it, but I was a little bummed. Many guests came in, looked at the list of tables, and were relieved that Shannon wasn't at their table. Then they felt they can party freely. I don't regret not inviting her, but I feel like in hindsight, I could have approached the subject differently/sooner.\n\nAm I the asshole for not inviting his plus one?\n",

      "scenario_description": "I just got my driver’s license after so many years because honestly, I was really scared to drive—especially when it’s my turn behind the wheel. So, I hired a driving instructor for the day to help me get more comfortable with the car and the road. Before I started practicing, my boyfriend and I agreed that he’d come with me after work sometimes so he could learn how to drive the car too. But we also agreed to stay flexible with our plans and schedules since we’re both pretty busy, especially him.\n\nSince I was driving, I didn’t check my phone or read messages because I’m still new at this and I didn’t want to mess up or distract myself. So, I wasn’t able to update him much or really focus on his messages. I did tell him that we could practice together the next day, but I had no idea he already left and was driving around looking for me. We missed each other, and he got upset.\n\nWhen he got home, I kept apologizing and calling him, but he wouldn’t answer. I cried so much because I felt really bad about everything. The next day he finally replied and said he told his mom what happened (he’s a total mama’s boy), and his mom told him that my attitude was terrible, that he was “poor him” for being with me, and even worried about what would happen if we got married.\n\nIt really hurt me to be judged like that, especially over something I didn’t mean to happen and that was kinda out of my control. It felt like all the good things I’ve done for him and his family didn’t matter anymore. And the crazy part is, his mom doesn’t even know what he’s done to me—things way worse than this (like micro-cheating, barely putting in effort, emotional immaturity, just to name a few).\n",

As you say he's a mama's boy so what do you expect?\n\nI just think you're overreacting.  Clearly, he also recated in a completely jackass manner for not being able to contact you.  Who knows how he would have relayed his side to her as he was upset to the point of refusing to answer your calls.\n\nAs a Mom she's entitled to react to her child being upset.  She didn't say anything to you, she didn't tell him breakup.  She's just upset he's upset.\n\nJust leave it alone.  Your issue is not her (not if that's all she's done), your issue is your BF.  You're more hurt she said that than his behaviour?",

We originally met through our daughters, who play basketball on multiple teams together, and over time, we started dating.\n\nDuring the games, I sometimes become hyper-focused on my daughter. Conversations get interrupted as I watch her closely. She could be doing almost anything on the court or even sitting on the bench, but something will catch my eye, and I’ll zone in on her for anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. I do this to my girlfriend’s daughter as well, but I’ll admit it’s not nearly as often. \n\nThis tendency to focus on my daughter has caused a lot of tension and repeated arguments between us. While we occasionally argue about other things, this particular issue continues to be a major source of conflict.\n\nAt this point, there seems to be nothing I can say or do to fix the situation. I’ve tried to change, but when my daughter is visibly upset or about to make a big play, I naturally focus on her rather than on my girlfriend.\n\nSo, AITA for not giving my girlfriend enough attention during our daughters' basketball games?",

      "scenario_description": "My husband and his sister were gifted the leasehold to a flat in the UK by their mother a few years ago. I bought out my sister-in-law.\n\nMy husbands mother and another lady (\"Kiki\") are the freeholders since 2010. When we asked when maintenance was next scheduled we learned that in the 15 years of ownership they have done very (VERY) little in terms of building maintenance (a responsibility of the freeholders, Kiki was also the property manager).\n\nSince we became owners of the flat (which is rented out) we have tried to get the freeholders to make good on their legal obligations as per the lease. We sent emails to Kiki, then more emails, and eventually we included my husband's mother as the other responsible freeholder in emails to try and get them to take action.\n\nInstead of helping us, my mother-in-law ignored my emails and formal complaints, and when I spoke to her she said she \"knew nothing about these issues\" and that she thought Kiki was an \"excellent manager\". \n\nMay 2nd this year I wrote a formal letter about the fire safety issues, roof maintenance, wall maintenance, decoration, and other historic neglect issues as covered in our lease (that I have been trying to get sorted for a year now) asking for a response in 20 days.\n\nOf course we did not receive a response. My suggestion now is to write a formal letter of claim through a lawyer to try to compel them to do the necessary works. We legally have to pay for the maintenance works as leaseholders, but not for the historic neglect.\n\nMy husband thinks I WBTA if I threathen with legal action, and he suggests that we keep trying through emails and calls.  He also feels uncomfortable that we try to get his mother to pay her historic contribution to the necessary works to the building because she originally gifted the property to him.  He feels that the cost of the repairs to roof, walls, etc will be less than this 'gifted' amount (around 80K), so to take the gift and then legally challenge for the historic repairs is unfair. He is also reluctant to enter into confrontation (legal or otherwise) with his mother.\n\nI respect this. But my view is that she owned the leasehold and freehold to the flat for 15 years, and in all those years benefitted from the rental income whilst neglecting to maintain the building. All issues that I have raised predate our ownership, and additionally she is the freeholder and thus responsible. \n\nFor various other reasons I don't really speak to my mother-in-law anymore so I fear my judgement is clouded by this because I feel I always get punished for trying to do the right thing. My husband and I also always argue about her behaviour because when I call out manipulation or lying I am the problem for getting upset, she is never the problem for behaving badly.. He says he feels in the middle.\n\nWIBTA if I sent a letter of claim though a lawfirm to get my mother in law and her fellow freeholder to comply with the law and the lease?",

I guess it doesn't matter to you that it's your husband's mother because you don't like her.\n\nI think you are wrong for buying SIL's interest and then making a family arrangement business.  Buy another damn property for that.  Neither your husband nor his sister ever intended to hold their Mom responsible since after all it was a gift to them.  I'm sure you always knew this.

She was driving and saw a deer running in front of her so she slammed on the brakes, swerved, and then proceeded to hit three cars and slam into a tree.

But deep down, I still resent her. And not in the usual “evil stepmom” kind of way.\n\nBefore I was born, Sheila and my dad were together in their early 20s. I don’t know the full story, but it was abusive. Bad enough that Sheila literally ran away to Florida to escape him and cut contact completely.\n\nFast forward to when I was in 6th grade. I was with my grandma (who practically raised me), and we randomly ran into Sheila at a store. I didn’t know who she was, but she told my grandma that she had just seen my dad a few days earlier, and they’d exchanged numbers. She asked if she should reach out. My grandma told her not to since my dad was already dating someone else.\n\nWell, a few weeks later, I met Sheila for the first time, and shortly after, she was living with us. Eventually, we moved into her house about 30 minutes away from where I grew up. After that, whenever they fought (which was often), she’d kick us out. I got kicked out of the house with my dad twice, and one time she just kicked him out and let me stay, but it was super uncomfortable. Each time she kicked him out, she also filed a restraining order on him.\n\nHere’s why I resent her: she knew who he was. She experienced his abuse firsthand. She had already escaped him once. But she still chose to get back with him, and by doing that, she brought all that chaos back. not just into her life, but into mine. I was still a kid. I didn’t choose this. But I’ve had to deal with cops at the house, screaming matches, being kicked out, instability. all because she decided to give him another chance.\n\nI know abusive relationships are complicated. I know manipulation is real. But this wasn’t the first time. This wasn’t someone who didn’t know better. She knew exactly who he was—years before I was even born. And now I’m the one dealing with the consequences of her decision to come back.\n\nShe’s nice to me, yeah. But I can’t pretend like that makes it okay. I feel like my life would’ve been so different if she had just walked away that day in the store. And I hate that I think that.\n\nAITA for resenting her, even though she never directly hurt me?\n\nEDIT: just want to clear something up, because a lot of the responses are saying I’m “blaming the abused instead of the abuser,” and that’s not what I’m trying to do at all. To be 100% clear: I do hold my father responsible for everything he’s done. He is absolutely the root cause of the abuse and chaos. I’m not excusing him in any way. I’ve lived with him. I know how bad he is, and I’ve never once seen him as anything other than the main source of the problem. That said, this post wasn’t about him. This was about my feelings toward my stepmom specifically, someone who re-entered his life (and mine) after already having firsthand experience of what he’s capable of. She’s not the abuser, but her choices did have serious consequences for me, as a child caught in the middle.\n\nEDIT 2: this isn’t about blaming her for the abuse. he’s fully responsible for that. My issue is that she came back to him after 20+ years, knowing how bad things were back then, knowing he was already in a relationship, and even after being warned by his own mother not to get involved with him again. She still made the conscious decision to reinsert herself into his life, disrupt his current relationship, and be with him. He’s at fault too, obviously. but this post is about her choice to come back despite everything. Everyone under this post seems to believe that being a victim excuses you from also being partly to blame.",

The last 2-3 months i we have spent every weekend from friday till sunday together (sometimes from thursday). \n\nSince this time I have already lost contact to some of my friends of whom i have been really close. I dont want to lose them all so i have to something with them.\n\nOne thing to consider though is that she has been diagnosed with cervical cancer but her recovery has been going well. I tried to make extra time for her, called her every evening and we probably been texting nonstop.(Last week we even took a little vacation and everything was perfect)\n\nYesterday when i asked her, i asked 3 times if it is really ok she said yes. About 2 hours later she then texted me she is going to visit and take drugs with an old friend who she had something with and phrased it in a way that was trying to hurt me. \"Dont worry I am going to wear underwear when we are going to sleep in the same bed.\" \"I guess he has to look at the new dresses i just bought\"\n\nI am trying to stay calm and understand her view but it was going to be half a day with my friends who i haven't seen for months. Saturday and Sunday she would have had me again. She then got drunk and wants to break up. \n\nAm i the asshole?",

The next day that I had gotten it I couldn’t find it and thought that someone had stolen it. I told my sister and I got sad because I felt bad because I thought that someone had stolen the brand new lacrosse stick that my sister had spent 80$ on. I eventually found it on the bottom shelf behind a whole bunch of boxes. My dad asked my mom if she had put it there and she said yes because she had tripped on it and had put it in an easily accessible spot. As I mentioned before in was in the corner of my garage on the bottom shelf behind a whole bunch of boxes and to her I said well that’s a kinda stupid spot to put it. I know I could have used my words in a different way but I was not able to fully comprehend what I was saying as I had just felt extremely guilty as I thought someone had stolen the brand new lacrosse stick. My mom was trying to tell me to put it in a driffent spot but I was not paying attention because I was trying not to cry because I had already felt bad about the stick and now my mom was talking to me and I was just overwhelmed. Suddenly she called me a stupid dramatic bitch and I lost it I started crying even more I walked outside because I felt unsafe. I feel like I was dramatic about it and that I was the asshole in the situation and I should have listen to her about where to put it. AITA?",

      "scenario_description": "I (26F) still feel hurt about something that happened when I was around 15–16. Back then, my family was living in Germany (military) and my mom (46) planned a detailed weeklong trip to Italy for our family of five, plus my cousin. Italy was close by and is my favorite place in the world, so I was excited based on vague mentions that it would happen “sometime in the summer\" (which typically means when school is out... right?). But I was never given actual dates or any concrete info, no mention of it at dinner, no family meeting called, it wasn't even on the family calendar which usually had everything from big trips like this to dentist appointments.\n\nI was the only one in high school at the time, so I was the only child with a schedule that really mattered and I had a major AP project due right at the end of the school year. Four days before the trip, my stepdad casually asked if I had packed yet, that was the first time I realized this trip was actually happening *then*. By that point, it was too late. I couldn’t go without tanking my grade, because part of the assignment included presenting it in class.\n\nThis came up again recently, and it turned into a three-day argument. All I want is a real apology from my mom for not telling me, just a simple “I’m sorry I didn’t let you know when I should have\" and this would not have been as dragged out as it has been. Instead, she offered vague apologies like “I’m sorry your schedule felt overlooked, I'm sorry it didn't fall on your timeline” and focuses more on how hard it was to plan a trip for six people.\n\nI’ve acknowledged how much she took on and how little help she had from her husband (who should have been more involved), I get that coordinating everything was a huge task. But I don’t understand how telling me somehow didn’t make the cut with all that effort she put into planning. Part of planning a big trip is making sure everyone involved knows about it... right?  \nShe packed bags for everyone else. Everyone else knew in advance. I was the only one blindsided. If I knew just a full week before leaving I would have been able to go because I would have had actual time to prepare, finish my project, and work something out with my teacher in regards to presenting that didn't seem like I was just asking for an extension due to poor time planning.\n\nTo me, it’s not about holding a grudge or wanting to rehash the past. It’s about wanting her to take real ownership of the fact that she didn’t communicate something important without trying to defend it. Instead, she seems to think that her stress at the time should excuse the oversight completely.\n\nSo Reddit—**AITA for still wanting a direct apology all these years later?**\n\nEdit: There was a plane ticket in my name. But like everything else here, I never knew it existed.  \nI ended up staying with a family friend since they would have gotten in trouble with the military for leaving me alone in the house for longer than a couple days.\n\nUpdate: I asked my stepdad what he remembered about this. Initially, he thought that I was told about the trip and just didn't pack for it. After knowing that I was never told, HE offered an apology. So there is some closure there. Its nice to finally hear from SOMEONE \"im sorry you never knew, that was messed up\" which is all I really needed.",

That being said, when he is here, I find Mark to be a pretty good kid, polite and respectful. \n\nHis dad decided to take a trip for work, in the last few weeks of school, so Mark's here for a bit. He's out of the house most of the time and doesn't take up much space. He does get kind of grumpy when there’s too much going on around him, especially noise, but for that, his favourite thing are these expensive noise-cancelling headphones which he almost always has with him- a present from his dad. \n\nEmily’s school has already finished, so she's home. The problem is that the room Mark is, sometimes has miscellaneous items put in when he's not here and therefore Emily seems to think its fair game to go through his stuff. I've told her to stop, but Sasha hasn't been taking it seriously, imo, saying that most of Mark's stuff is easy to replace.\n\nThe big problem happened when Mark accidentally left his headphones in his room, and Emily accidentally snapped them. \n\nMark found out when he came home from school and flipped. He shouted at her, saying she was 'spoilt without anything to back it up', loud enough that my wife and I heard it from the other room. Sasha wanted me to calm things down, which I did- but I also told Emily she’s replacing them.\n\nThing is, Mark’s dad offered have someone get him a new pair immediately, and that it wasn't a problem. I said Emily would pay him back, and I'm sticking with it. \n\nEmily and Sasha think that’s unfair since Mark’s dad can afford to buy 10 more. But I don’t think you get to break someone’s stuff and not pay for it. Those aren't the values I was raised with or what I want for my daughter.\n\nThat being said, I do realise in this case its kind of unnecessary and there may be better ways for her to make it up to him. AITA? ",

But only later I realized some of the new dates are conflicting with the scheduled birth of my niece, so I told my husband we’d had to cut two to three days off our trip so I could be back home in time to be with my sister. I had promised I’d be there for her because we lost our mother years ago and I have been ‘her person’ ever since.\n\nMy husband said I should have told him this before he rearranged the trip, and it’s true, I could have, I just didn’t realize the dates would overlap at the time. Yet he still seemed mad at me, so I said he has no reason to be acting like this, since I also had made plans to travel in April and understood when his own commitments led us to postpone. He sees it differently, as if his work obligations were something he couldn’t get away from, but I say the same goes for the plans I made with my sister.",

      "scenario_description": "Me (31M) and my gf (29F) were out to dinner the other night at this bar/restaurant/resort type place that does cabin rentals and lake activities (kayaks, fishing, tubing, etc.). We live in the area so we weren't renting a cabin, just there for dinner.\n \n&nbsp;\n \nThey have a gender neutral single stall bathroom that locks, the kind that only one person can use at a time. My gf and I have been dating for nearly 6 years, so we obviously are not concerned about privacy. We both had to use the bathroom and we went in there together. This is not the first time we've done this at other places with similar style bathrooms. I used it first while she touched up her make up, then she used it. We washed up and left. Had to have been less than 5 mins in and out. Probably around 3 or 4 mins max. \n\n&nbsp;\n \nWhen we exited, there was a mother waiting with two young kids that appeared to be waiting for the bathroom. As soon as she saw us both exit, she shot daggers at us and scoffed like she was utterly appalled by us. She said something to her kids to the effect of \"we can't use this bathroom, come on, we'll have to find another one\" and apparently said to my gf \"you two should be disgusted, this is a family resort\" verbatim. \n\n&nbsp;\n \nIt's obvious she assumed we were in there banging, but we absolutely were not. To me this is completely normalized and akin to our morning routines. Are we assholes for using the bathroom at the same time?",

      "scenario_description": "I (25, F) have been dating my girlfriend “Kate” (21, F) for a few years now. We recently had a very difficult time in our relationship. she found an old diary entry I had written early this year (in a language she doesn’t speak) where I was emotionally processing some guilt and sadness around how I handled my past relationship with my ex of approx 4 years. I hadn’t shared it with her because I was working through it privately and didn’t fully understand my own feelings at the time, but more so because it didn’t affect my ability to be present in my own relationship. When she found it and translated it, it caused a huge amount of hurt, understandably, and we took a break. We’ve recently reconciled after a lot of communication and mutual accountability. Things are healing and I’m hopeful again.\n\nFast-forward to this past weekend: Kate stayed at my flat for the first time in a while, where my mum has temporarily moved in, as her permanent home is abroad. The next morning, my mum made a comment to me that Kate had said something really pointed to her. Apparently, after I left the garden and it was solely Kate & my mum together, Kate  came in and said something along the lines of, “Well, I’ll go see what else I can find and read,” which my mum interpreted as a sarcastic dig, referencing the diary incident.\n\nI was surprised, because the mood had seemed fine. I just calmly asked Kate about it two days later. She was really taken aback and said that it never happened like that at all. According to her, it was a warm moment — my mum asked if she was okay, they exchanged I love yous, and there was no mention or tone that would suggest a sarcastic comment. I didn’t accuse her, I just asked because I wanted clarity. There’s already tension between Kate and my family due to the recent issues, and I just wanted to make sure nothing else would snowball.\n\nBut now my mum is furious. She said she knows “where she stands” with me, that I didn’t believe her, and that she wants nothing to do with either of us. I feel completely caught in the middle. Whereas in reality I just wanted clarity as two people I love and care about are telling me two completely different things - someone is lying to me.\n\nI didn’t take sides, I just wanted to understand what was actually said. But now I feel like I’ve caused a major rift, and it’s stressing me out. I’m doing my best to rebuild my relationship with Kate while keeping things civil with my family, but it feels like I’m being punished for trying to be neutral and honest.\n\nMy mum has calmed down but I can tell this whole thing is still on her mind. Kate wants to clear her name & chat with my mum face to face but given how explosive my mum was with me not immediately believing her without question, I think this would come right back to me & cause irreparable damage.\n\nSo — AITA for asking my girlfriend about what was said to my mum, which has now made my mum want nothing to do with either of us?",

No clarity is needed - your actions caused this to snowball.\n\nYour Mom said something and that's her interpretation of the convo with Kate.  So what? Why does her view of something need to be corrected? If she thinks Kate was being sarcastic - ok it's not about Mom, it's about you and Kate. Even if Kate said that sarcastically - so what? It does not impact your Mother.   \n\nYou then addressed it with Kate (which your Mom didn't need to know).  Kate tells you somethung different. Ok - the underlying issue is between you and Kate. So if Kate feels no I didn't say that or wasn't sarcastic then just leave it there.  What was there to go back to your Mom on?\n\nAlso, wtf about someone is lying to you?  OP - ylu are creatung issues where there is none. 2 people have different views of a conversation and because you feel someone is lying, you're pitting them against the other.\n\nDoes it really matter who said what, how? Or is it that what matters is that you and Kate resolve the issue re the diary?\n\nYTA - you need to learn to fight the right battles, focus on what matters and just drop things.",

      "scenario_description": "So I (26F) was supposed to be a bridesmaid for my friend’s (27F) wedding we used to be close in college but haven’t really talked that much since then. I honestly was kinda surprised she even asked me\n\nPlanning was a disaster she was micromanaging every single thing and kept acting like we were all just accessories in her aesthetic she wanted us to have identical nails and lashes and like I get wanting a vibe but I said in the group chat I wasn’t doing long fake nails since I work in healthcare and she got mad and made some comment like “then maybe you’re not a fit for the bridal party” so I said “maybe I’m not” and I guess that was that\n\nFew days later she texted me saying she was taking me out of the wedding party but I could still come as a guest which tbh felt kinda humiliating especially after I already bought the dress shoes and paid for alterations. Over $350\n\nI asked if I could still wear the dress to the wedding since it’s not like I can return it and she said absolutely not she doesn’t want anyone wearing that dress unless they’re in the photos and didn’t want “reminders of negativity” at her wedding \n\nSo I didn’t go\n\nBut yeah two days later I wore the dress to brunch and posted pics and tagged the store it was definitely the same dress and same color scheme she used for the wedding so our mutuals realized it and I guess it got back to her\n\nShe sent this whole thing about how I was being disrespectful and intentionally trying to ruin her vibe and I was like ??? it’s a dress I paid for and it looks good\n\nSome friends say I had every right, others say I clearly posted it to stir the pot which I didn’t the dresss was expensive and the brunch was very formal and I needed a dress and I had it so i wore it \n\nAITA?\n\n\nupdate: I just wanna clarify a few things, I do have other dresses I could’ve worn to the brunch but none fit that theme, person who hosted wanted light colors all my other dresses are dark green, red, black, some just white. I only had the light blue dress that was bought for the wedding. I originally didn’t even plan on going to the brunch but decided last minute since my girlfriend wanted to go and wanted me with her. \n\n\nsmall other update/clarification: the dress wasn’t from a wedding dress store it was a normal mall store think zara or H&M, that’s what i tagged not a bridal shop store. \n\n\nlast update: good to know I’m not the AH lol, as for the situation I’m just going to let everything pass and not entertain anyone including my now ex girlfriend don’t know why she was so upset on behalf the bride but whatever. Im done with all the drama this has all drained me badly. Thank you to all the people who commented didn’t think it would reach 10 people let alone 400+ ",

      "scenario_description": "I (22F) got pregnant after a one-night stand with a friend. I’ve been trying to involve the dad in everything he rarely responds to my messages and when I do get replies it’s usually his mam. She has 5 sons but always wanted a daughter, since I’m having a girl she sees it as her second chance.Lately it’s felt like she’s trying to take over. Early on I said I didn’t want our parents controlling decisions but his mam relays messages through my mam instead of coming to me directly. If I text him about the baby he ignores it or I get a message from his mam.\n\nThe first conflict came because I can only have two people in the delivery room, I chose my mam and cousin, people who will comfort me. I plan to have him come in right after birth for bonding time. But before I could explain that, his mam said she wanted to be there, and later messaged me saying she was “heartbroken” I wouldn’t let him be there and that it was unfair.\n\nLater, I tried to talk to him about the first weeks after birth. I plan to breastfeed and need to recover, so I asked if he could come to mine for visits during the first couple weeks. I said he’s welcome to come every day, even stay over. After that I’d be happy to start taking turns going to his or going out together. He didn’t respond but I got a message from his mam. She said it was “totally unreasonable” to expect him to come to me and that he wants the baby overnight once a week at her house. She suggested I sleep there because “he doesn’t like sleeping out” I ended up making a group chat with both our mams and him to explain that I’m only asking for the first two weeks and I’m open to compromise after that. But she doubled down saying I’m making all the decisions without involving him.\n\nThe only decision I made without him was choosing godparents. Everything else, names, prams, baby clothes. I’ve included him in. He picked his own godparents too. The only thing I said no to was naming the baby after himself if it were a boy because I don’t like the idea of juniors.\n\nShe argued that him visiting at my house isn’t “real” bonding time, even though I said my family would step out during visits and that he could have time alone with the baby while I nap or shower. Then she posted on Facebook about how she’s “finally getting her little girl,” and now she’s saying he should go to a solicitor so she can have a custody schedule in writing for her peace of mind. I don’t want to drag my baby into legal stuff or create tension this early. I had a complicated relationship with my own dad and don’t want that for her. I want her dad and his family involved but not if it’s going to come at the cost of my mental health or ability to recover and bond with my baby in peace. His mam says she doesn’t want her son upset but doesn’t seem to care about me or my baby’s wellbeing. I’ve started overthinking everything and wondering if I’m being too controlling or unreasonable.\n\nSo AITA for trying to set boundaries?",

      "scenario_description": "I (22F) just moved back home from college after graduating. My home is a small 3-bedroom townhouse and being that I am the middle child, I have never had my own room. I would either share rooms with my younger brother (20M) or older sister (25F). As my siblings and I grew older, my brother moved into the basement and his old bedroom was inhabited by whichever family was staying with us at the time, so I continued to share a room with my sister. When I went off to college I was happy to finally have my own room and a space to call my own.\n\n\n\nNow that I am done with school, I moved out of my college apartment and back home. The room that my extended family members used to stay in is now vacant, so I was ok moving back knowing that I could be in that room and would still have my own personal space.\n\n\n\nOne weekend I left the house to go visit some friends, and when I came back to my new room, I noticed there were brown stains on my bed. Upon investigating further, I realized it was foundation. I don’t wear foundation, and neither does anyone else in my family, so I started to wonder where they came from. Then, I had remembered my mother talking about how she saw my brother with a girl through our ring doorbell at 2:00 am in the morning. I then connected the dots and realized the foundation must be from her. I was livid and confronted my brother about it immediately.\n\n\n\nI asked him if he brought the girl into my room and if they had done the deed, and he said yes to both. I cannot begin to explain how disgusted and angry I felt. I have never had a space in our house to call my own and when I finally do, he violates it in the worst way. When I called him out, he apologized, but justified his actions by stating that my mom and sister had fallen asleep in the basement where he stays and that they had no where else to go. He elaborated that it was only her face on the bed, so no bodily fluids got on it (which to me does not matter because they did it in my room!). He also feigned ignorance by claiming that he didn’t know I would be upset because he would not care if me and my boyfriend did the same to him (lies). He also said that I was making a big deal out of nothing and that it used to be his old room anyways, and that it was not my room. Lastly, he said I was a bad sister for threatening to tell on him because he is always driving me places and “covered” for me when I first started seeing my boyfriend and leaving the house to go on dates.\n\n\n\nIt has been three days since I confronted him and I am still very angry. Not only did he disrespect and violate my personal space and boundaries by bringing a random girl into my room and doing unspeakable things with her, but he didn’t even have the decency to change the sheets, let alone make the bed. I am contemplating telling my parents because I am so angry that I want to get a lock for the room that only I would have the key for. So would I be the a-hole for snitching on my brother?",

      "scenario_description": "I'm 20F and live with two other girls who are around my age. We get along well for the most part. We have group dinners once or twice a week where we cook, drink a little, and just chill. It's something we all look forward to after stressful days.\n\nOne of my roommates, let's call her Sarah, has been going through a rough time lately. Her dad passed away a couple months ago and she’s been pretty open about struggling. I get it. That’s obviously horrible and I was super supportive at first. I even helped her clean her room and brought her food a few times when she couldn’t get out of bed.\n\nBut lately she brings it up almost every time we hang out. Like we’ll be halfway through dinner and she’ll randomly say something about how hard it is to eat alone now or how she misses hearing her dad’s voice. Everyone kind of gets quiet and it kills the mood. I know she’s hurting but it feels like she’s hijacking every moment to turn it into a therapy session.\n\nLast night I snapped a little. She brought up how she couldn’t sleep again and I kind of sighed and said, “Can we not do the trauma-dump thing tonight? It’s a little much and honestly it ruins the vibe.” She got really quiet and went to her room. The other roommate said that was harsh and I should’ve just talked to her privately.\n\nNow Sarah’s barely said a word to me and I feel bad, but I also feel like I’m allowed to not want to feel emotionally drained all the time. Still, I know she’s grieving and I probably came off like a heartless jerk.\n\nSo yeah. AITA?",

It was her birthday a few days ago, so it was the perfect time for them to come see her. They live about 2 1/2 hours away and don’t visit that often.\n\nBack in October, I found out that I was pregnant with our second child, but unfortunately lost the pregnancy. I was crushed, but I was eager to try again. We had told my husband’s parents that I was pregnant, but when we lost the baby the first thing his mom said to me was that it was God’s plan and that they had “mourned their loss.”\n\nWhen I got pregnant a few months later, it ended up being a partial molar pregnancy, so it was not viable in resulted in another miscarriage. Once again, his mother said that it was God‘s plan. She’s not generally a mean person, and I think she just says things without thinking, but yesterday had brunch she looked at me and said, “you would’ve had a baby today!”  I️ had forgotten it would’ve been my due date with the first loss. \n\nI could not believe that she said that to me at all let alone in public. I brushed it off with a joke something like oh I would be even more tired than I already am. But that ruined the entire day for me. I have now told my husband that I do not want to go on the beach vacation That they had planned a couple weeks from now because I don’t wanna hang out with his family. He really wants me to go because it would be a lot to manage our toddler daughter on his own in a new place but I️ just have no interest in being around his mom after yesterday. \n\nI️ said he could take our daughter solo but he says he doesn’t want to go without me. I’m not going. AITA?",

I think people forget that close relatives are also invested in the pregnancy, birth and baby.  MIL remembers.  It is pretty normal for people to acknowledge a death anniversary or even what could have been.\n\nI just am not seeing this as cruel if it's not even on OP's mind suggesting that OP is past this.  Is it that noone should ever mention the miscarriages or the babies that could have been when as close relatives you also were invested? \n\nIf OP showed that she hadn't moved past it enough or even seemed subdued at brunch, I'd understand but with no cues from OP why is it cruel for MIL to think of the grandbaby she could have had?  \n\nSounds like it's cruel only because OP forgot.",
