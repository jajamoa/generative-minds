I started out renting a room in a shared apartment in the Mission District, but after about a year, I had to move when the building was sold. I then found a small studio in the Inner Richmond, which worked out well until rent increases made it unaffordable. In 2022, I moved into a shared house with some friends in the Sunset, which helped lower costs and gave me a more stable situation. Throughout these years, changes were mainly due to affordability, lease issues, and trying to find better living conditions within my budget."
