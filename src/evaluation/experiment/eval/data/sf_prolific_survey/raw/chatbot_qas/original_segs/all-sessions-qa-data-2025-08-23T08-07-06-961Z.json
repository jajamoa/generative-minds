And so I think the relationship between greed and capitalism is very easy to see, and the influence that capitalism has on greed is positive in the sense that it's increasing, because as our current political climate gets worse, our socioeconomic climate gets worse, it incentivizes people to hoard their wealth even more out of scarcity.",

Landlords and homeowners and just those with wealth have driven up the prices for homes and made it really difficult for others to afford them. So I think instead of focusing on building more infrastructure, we should be focusing on how we can lower the cost of infrastructure that already exists.

I believe when people look at other parts of the world and they view their overcrowding, it can become very uneasy to imagine what life might be like living within that overcrowded society. And I don't think many people would be willing to just jump right into that change, just going from a normal society or a normally populated society to one that's overcrowded.

I don't know. You might have a huge shift and you'll still have some people that don't support it. So the only way to find out would be to implement these changes and find out. I mean, does their support matter at this point in time? Or is the other option just having people homeless or not being able to afford rent? To be essentially shoved into poverty because rents rise so high they can't afford food. So my opinion is if they don't support it, I don't care. What matters is that positive change takes effect.

And as far as it having a positive and a negative effect, when it comes to density, it's going to have probably both. There's always pros and cons to every solution, but again, it's a crisis, got to do something. And what's a more negative effect, right? A little bit of density or people being homeless, people having no money at the end of the month because every penny goes to rent and food.

        "answer": "I'm not too sure how to answer that question. When you talk about the interests of current residents, they don't own that city. They're just residents of the city. So when future residents show up, they have just as much a right to be there as current residents do. When you're making zoning decisions, you should take in consideration that everyone can be a resident, current and future people, and that making decisions that are going to positively affect people's lives are the wise decisions. And if somebody wants to complain about it, sure, they can. But again, you know, we're just passing through in this life, and nobody really owns anything. We're just here temporarily.",

        "answer": "Well, when it comes to building housing, I don't think social equity is the highest and most important factor. However, it will come into play in that people who are poorer would suddenly have the ability to rent places that they otherwise might not be able to rent right now. Having the opportunity to keep a roof over your head, I think, does play a role and is one of the reasons that the zoning and housing policies to create the amount of available housing is important.",

I would hope that any change, no matter how small, would be looked upon as a positive. But then there are some people who are going to be against it no matter what. Would it take larger shifts? I don't know. You might have a huge shift and you'll still have some people that don't support it. So the only way to find out would be to implement these changes and find out. I mean, does their support matter at this point in time? Or is the other option just having people homeless or not being able to afford rent? To be essentially shoved into poverty because rents rise so high they can't afford food. So my opinion is if they don't support it, I don't care. What matters is that positive change takes effect. And the naysayers and the negative Nancy's, they can whine all they want. You asked, does it have a positive effect increasing it or a negative effect decreasing this? How strong is the effect?

A little bit of density or people being homeless, people having no money at the end of the month because every penny goes to rent and food.
