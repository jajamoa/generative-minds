Policies that include affordable housing features or a focus on sustainability also build support, especially among equity- or environment-focused individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, support can fall sharply if residents feel that upzoning will change the face of the neighborhood, increase traffic, or overburden the facilities of the surrounding community. A lack of transparency or participation in the planning process will give rise to distrust and opposition. Similarly, if upzoning is perceived as being for the developer's gain rather than the community's, individuals will resist even if there are broader gains.

Political pressure is either weak or strong based on the prevailing political climate.\n\nEconomic Conditions (Moderate): Boom or recession cycles in the economy can reverse the trend of zoning policy, with liberal measures in times of boom to spur expansion, or stricter ones in periods of recession to protect existing property values.\n\nPublic Opinion (Moderate): Public opinion for or against a direction of zoning policy can result from communities speaking out in greater numbers regarding the affordability of housing and environmental issues.

With rising rents, especially in highly sought-after urban areas, people will experience a sense of desperation and frustration with housing affordability. This creates a strong push for policy changes like upzoning to increase housing supply. The effect is significant, with people considering upzoning to be a possible solution in order to ease housing demands by increasing the number of available units and ultimately decreasing prices. Raising rents has the potential to quickly influence public sentiments toward accepting upzoning measures as a solution to eliminate the housing affordability crisis.",

If residents perceive visible housing crisesâ€”e.g., rising rents, over-crowding, or homelessnessâ€”support picks up because upzoning is viewed as a way to ease pressure on the housing market. Policies that include affordable housing features or a focus on sustainability also build support, especially among equity- or environment-focused individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, support can fall sharply if residents feel that upzoning will change the face of the neighborhood, increase traffic, or overburden the facilities of the surrounding community. A lack of transparency or participation in the planning process will give rise to distrust and opposition. Similarly, if upzoning is perceived as being for the developer's gain rather than the community's, individuals will resist even if there are broader gains.

        "answer": "I am fairly sure that sustainability changes lead to beneficial changes in upzoning support, but the magnitude of the effect depends on the context. If upzoning is strongly linked with sustainable impactsâ€”such as avoiding sprawl, reducing emissions through walkable areas, or enabling transit-oriented developmentâ€”support increases, particularly among green-minded residents and younger people.\n\nBut the effect tends to be gradual rather than immediate. People are more persuaded if gains for sustainability are real and proximateâ€”e.g., fewer automobiles on the road or cleaner public spaces due to more compact development. Conversely, intangible greens without concrete local effect can be no better than weakly compelling.\n\nTypically, sustainability is an influential secondary narrative of upzoning, but its strength is enhanced when it is supported by education, transparency, and concrete results.",

        "answer": "Upzoning policy reforms are typically driven by housing demand, political pressure, economic factors, and public opinion. \n\nHousing Demand (Strong): When cities are facing shortages or rising housing prices, there will be considerable pressure to ease zoning to increase supply, which is a powerful inducement for reform.\n\nPolitical Pressure (Moderate to Strong): Elected officials, advocacy groups, and developers can apply pressure towards upzoning, especially where there is high growth ambitions or general feeling of a housing crisis. Political pressure is either weak or strong based on the prevailing political climate.\n\nEconomic Conditions (Moderate): Boom or recession cycles in the economy can reverse the trend of zoning policy, with liberal measures in times of boom to spur expansion, or stricter ones in periods of recession to protect existing property values.\n\nPublic Opinion (Moderate): Public opinion for or against a direction of zoning policy can result from communities speaking out in greater numbers regarding the affordability of housing and environmental issues. The effect is moderate because change only occurs when the pressure is ongoing or escalated through activism or a local movement.\n\nOverall, political pressure and demand for housing are the strongest determinants of upzoning policy changes, with economic conditions and public opinion exercising moderate influences.",

On the downside could be property values drop for existing housing, but I don't think that's that much of a concern. It's at least not the biggest concern amongst all these things. I think from just an economic standpoint altogether it would be very good because you'll have more people living in these areas that can contribute to the local economy. It would be very positive.",

I think when you look at someone comparing their potential with their property value might go down or their view might not be as nice as it once was, you have to weight that versus people that want to just have a home and currently are unable to do that because of the current situation.

And all of this politicking and networking unfortunately has a huge role in zoning and housing and other aspects of local government or government in general. Thank you.",

I would think that in most cases it would take time to develop just to change your mentality about where you live and how you live but to get used to the new rhythm and routine of your environment. I think the effect of escape from urban environment would probably have a negative effect on support for upzoning because if you are leaving that urban environment you have a specific reason why you're doing it and it's most likely because you feel negatively about being in a tighter space that's more congested with more people.

I think when you're younger and have either very young kids or don't have kids yet, probably when you're in the earlier stages of your career, you're more in support of upzoning or at least enjoy the benefits of upzoning for yourself. But as you get older, you have a larger family, you need more space, you're thinking about homeownership and equity and moving further along in your life and where you want to see yourself financially and status-wise, these are times when you may have a more negative thought process regarding upzoning or just understand that it's not for you. And politics-wise, I don't know, it seems like more right-leaning people are conservative and live in the suburbs and more left-leaning people are city folks and enjoy that lifestyle more and enjoy the mix of people, personalities, cultures that you are going to come into contact with more frequently when you are in an upzoning or upzoned environment.",

This brings a lot of noise early in the morning on a work day, early on a weekday morning when residents are trying to relax. There is... there are roads that are closed off, narrowed lanes, parching spaces are lost, and it's a lot for a long time to deal with if you already live in a busy urban area.

        "answer": "Yes, I am a car driver, so I haven't been on public transportation in a long time, and I forgot to mention that. Cities are already congested, so having more people could possibly cause an increase in traffic congestion. However, if you have more people paying more taxes to invest in city infrastructure, it is highly likely that the transit authority would increase the service lines and service routes in the city to keep up, or attempt to keep up with the increase in residents in the city. So, this could go either way.",

There are far too many homeless people, far too many veterans struggling, far too many young people who have family issues, who don't have options or anywhere to go, and the number one goal of government should be to take care of its society and take care of its citizens. So we should certainly find a way to subsidize housing, even if that means giving breaks to property owners in order to house our citizens.",

Current residents shouldn't feel squeezed out of their existing homes whether that be on a noise level due to construction or due to squeezing in new residents around the existing residents and those new residents being so many that they make a lot of noise. I think that is a huge issue if you all of a sudden just try to squeeze people in and everyone is all of a sudden on top of each other that would quickly diminish the quality of life for all of the residents.",

I think the effect of Escape from urban environment would probably have a negative effect on Support for Upzoning because if you are leaving that urban environment you have a specific reason why you're doing it and it's most likely because you feel negatively about being in a tighter space that's more congested with more people.

But as you get older, you have a larger family, you need more space, you're thinking about homeownership and equity and moving further along in your life and where you want to see yourself financially and status-wise, these are times when you may have a more negative thought process regarding upzoning or just understand that it's not for you. And politics-wise, I don't know, it seems like more right-leaning people are conservative and live in the suburbs and more left-leaning people are city folks and enjoy that lifestyle more and enjoy the mix of people, personalities, cultures that you are going to come into contact with more frequently when you are in an upzoning or upzoned environment.",

You hear about this belief of a link between crime and upzoning frequently in the news, so I would say that this negative effect is quite strong because it's always an argument that people have in their back pocket ready to go when they want to argue against housing or moving certain groups from one area to another.

This brings a lot of noise early in the morning on a work day, early on a weekend morning when residents are trying to relax. There  are roads that are closed off, narrowed lanes, parking spaces are lost, and it's a lot for a long time to deal with if you already live in a busy urban area. Then this can certainly be impactful and have a negative effect on your living area or living environment for quite a long time.

I don't think that every neighborhood or subdivision needs to be akin to living in a large city and that's what having tall apartment buildings seems to me because you really only see that in major cities and I think it's okay for places to just have homes.",

I don't suggest that everyone who moves into an apartment is loud or inconsiderate, but that can certainly be a factor. Yeah, those would be mine. Overcrowding, noise, traffic, and that means more people in the local stores. And while that might benefit the local stores, I'm currently living in a tiny town whose one grocery store is already packed to the rafters because people come from an hour and a half in every direction to go to this one grocery store. To stand in line there is sometimes 45 minutes even for one item. It's okay to spread people out.",

It's going to help with the housing crisis and allow more people from lower or middle income to find a place to live in urban areas or area that's growing population. And also, it's also going to be more positive in terms of the environmental impact. I think when you're up zoning versus when you're just having single family homes, each household will emit less carbon dioxide or pollution, I guess. And it's going to be easier for maintenance. So each household or person renting or living in the building, for example, would be able to get help from the building supervisor or manager when they need to perform maintenance or repair. And it's just easier for them, I think. Versus single family homes where these people might have to do repairs themselves or have to hire other contractors and pay more for repair.

I think urban areas are already more vulnerable to the environmental impact of increased population growth, so it's more pollution in the urban area. I think upzoning also kind of helps with pollution because it could reduce the amount of pollution per household. If we design buildings to have more electric stovetops instead of gas stovetops, I think that could be more environmentally friendly. And also if the building uses renewable energy instead, I think that might have a more positive environmental impact. So it's kind of important. So I'm a bit uncertain about the environmental impact, the overall impact, but I feel like upzoning has both positive and negative impacts on the environment. So it's quite important. If there's a more positive environmental impact, I would support upzoning in urban areas. If there's more negative impact, I would not be as supportive of upzoning. So it's quite important to me.",

The negative effect include, so I haven't really thought about negative effects but I think the negative effect could include maybe lower wages from higher competition when there's more population competing for jobs in the area and then there might not be as much high pay available because when there's more people in the area they're competing for the same jobs they might accept lower wages so that's another negative impact or effect so when there's more families and more population there might not be as many jobs available and then there might be lower wages and then also the quality of living might not be as good.",

So when we talk about growing population, this factor would have a really strong impact that would be positive, that would positively influence the support for upzoning. When there's a higher population, when there's a rapid growth, we would mostly support upzoning to build upwards to help provide housing for these people. And then the environmental impact, I think the environmental factors could have both positive and negative influence on the support for upzoning. So when upzoning leads to more energy efficient buildings, that include more renewable energy or electric equipment over fossil fuels, I think it would have a more positive influence on the support for upzoning. And overcrowding and garbage though, that would have a negative impact on the influence for support for upzoning. And then also the rent, affordable rent would also have a more positive influence on the support for upzoning when you are building more homes through upzoning. And there's more supply and when that leads to cheaper rents or more housing prices that would encourage more people. And it's just going to help people find homes more easily.

So each household probably doesn't emit as much carbon, and it's less wasteful, and if the building adds electric stovetops or more energy-efficient refrigerators or appliances, I think that's going to be a lot more environmental, and that would really reduce carbon emissions.

It does take time to develop because it might cost a lot to add new developments and implement more environmental designs. And I think the population growth is going to have a positive effect. It's going to increase demand for upzoning. It's going to increase demand for vertical buildings, vertical expansions to allow more people to find homes at affordable prices.

And then in more liberal states, like California, environmental concern would probably be immediate. And it depends on the leader of the state or the area. Depends on their views on the environment. And I think it would have a positive effect or a more positive effect than negative effect because it really helps reduce carbon emissions for a large population that need housing.

So I'm not completely confident but I'm somewhat confident that it's going to help reduce carbon emission when there's more energy efficient design or environmental design.

        "shortText": "Upzoning impacts",
        "category": "research",
        "answer": "So I think it depends on the population and the number of people who are still homeless. So I think if it's like an urban area and there's more population, then it has a more positive impact. It's going to help with the housing crisis and allow more people from lower or middle income to find a place to live in urban areas or area that's growing population. And also, it's also going to be more positive in terms of the environmental impact. I think when you're up zoning versus when you're just having single family homes, each household will emit less carbon dioxide or pollution, I guess. And it's going to be easier for maintenance. So each household or person renting or living in the building, for example, would be able to get help from the building supervisor or manager when they need to perform maintenance or repair. And it's just easier for them, I think. Versus single family homes where these people might have to do repairs themselves or have to hire other contractors and pay more for repair. So I think it's more of a positive impact when we have up zoning. If the population is growing really fast.",

And there's going to there might be more garbage and emissions at the same time. So it's going to it might be more dirty, the streets might become more dirty more easily. And so the quality of life might not be as good. And there's increased housing density, the aesthetics of the building might not be as good as before, there might not be full sunlight and there are people that might not be able to see the natural scenery. So I feel like it could have more negative impact on the character and quality of life.

        "answer": "Environmental concerns would be important for me when making decisions about urban density and zoning. I think urban areas are already more vulnerable to the environmental impact of increased population growth, so it's more pollution in the urban area. I think upzoning also kind of helps with pollution because it could reduce the amount of pollution per household. If we design buildings to have more electric stovetops instead of gas stovetops, I think that could be more environmentally friendly. And also if the building uses renewable energy instead, I think that might have a more positive environmental impact. So it's kind of important. So I'm a bit uncertain about the environmental impact, the overall impact, but I feel like upzoning has both positive and negative impacts on the environment. So it's quite important. If there's a more positive environmental impact, I would support upzoning in urban areas. If there's more negative impact, I would not be as supportive of upzoning. So it's quite important to me.",

The negative effect include, so I haven't really thought about negative effects but I think the negative effect could include maybe lower wages from higher competition when there's more population competing for jobs in the area and then there might not be as much high pay available because when there's more people in the area they're competing for the same jobs they might accept lower wages so that's another negative impact or effect so when there's more families and more population there might not be as many jobs available and then there might be lower wages and then also the quality of living might not be as good.",

And they should also be able to still enjoy the natural scenery without having to worry about too much development in their area. They should still have access to the recreation in the area. And then at the same time, they have to allow for some development near their homes. And then for the future residents, they should be able to have affordable housing in the developments. They should be able to find opportunities in the area and they should just be able to have a place be accepted, but at the same time, they shouldn't disturb the current residents. They shouldn't cause too much noise or crowding. So these are some of the things that should be balanced. The current residents should be able to enjoy the current public facilities and recreation without too much pollution or being largely impacted by noise or pollution of the new developments. And then the future residents should be able to find affordable housing and job opportunities, but also they should keep in mind to not cause too much crowding or noise.",

It would allow for more social equity and access to opportunity for those people who are in lower income or unable to find affordable homes without jobs. It would allow, when there's upzoning and housing becomes more affordable, I think it would allow a lot more opportunity for people from various different groups, like the minority groups, to get this, get an opportunity to live in the area, find jobs in the area, go to school in the area.

So upzoning, when you're building up vertically, it would really help cover a highly densely populated area. So I think it would have a more positive effect, it would increase support for it when you have a lot more people in the area and there's limited space, and I think it's just more efficient to have upzoning for a very densely populated area with limited land available. How strong is this effect? I think it would have a really strong effect when there's a lot more demand for housing and there's limited land and there's a shortage of land or house available for multiple households. I think it would cause, it would lead to a lot more support for upzoning, so this is a very strong effect.",

Population growth would have a really strong impact that would positively influence the support for upzoning. When there's a higher population, when there's a rapid growth, we would mostly support upzoning to build upwards to help provide housing for these people. And then the environmental impact, I think the environmental factors could have both positive and negative influence on the support for upzoning. So when upzoning leads to more energy efficient buildings, that include more renewable energy or electric equipment over fossil fuels, I think it would have a more positive influence on the support for upzoning. And overcrowding and garbage though, that would have a negative impact on the influence for support for upzoning. And then also the rent, affordable rent would also have a more positive influence on the support for upzoning when you are building more homes through upzoning. And there's more supply and when that leads to cheaper rents or more housing prices that would encourage more people. And it's just going to help people find homes more easily.

This is really significant because climate change is getting worse, so it is very important to reduce carbon emissions when we're building more homes, and I think overall it would have a positive effect because when you build upwards, you allow more individuals and homes to share facilities in the building, and it's just more efficient compared to single-family homes. So each household probably doesn't emit as much carbon, and it's less wasteful, and if the building adds electric stovetops or more energy-efficient refrigerators or appliances, I think that's going to be a lot more environmental, and that would really reduce carbon emissions. So compared to single-family homes that might rely on traditional fossil fuels or traditional appliances, it's going to be more positive when there's upzoning, I think.

        "answer": "So, in my experience, the effect of population growth would take some time to influence the support for upzoning. You would probably take some time to be certain that the population is growing and it's become a bigger challenge. I think we would need more evidence and statistics to help us decide when the population growth becomes a bigger concern. It does take time to develop because it might cost a lot to add new developments and implement more environmental designs. And I think the population growth is going to have a positive effect. It's going to increase demand for upzoning. It's going to increase demand for vertical buildings, vertical expansions to allow more people to find homes at affordable prices. And this is a very strong effect because population growth is one of the main reasons that there's housing shortage in the densely populated area. And that's one of the main reasons for upzoning.",

        "answer": "I think the effect of environmental concerns might be immediate for some areas, but it might take time to develop for other areas. It really depends on the type of area. So for example, in the South, the more conservative states, the environmental concern might not be immediate, and it might take time. And then in more liberal states, like California, environmental concern would probably be immediate. And it depends on the leader of the state or the area. Depends on their views on the environment. And I think it would have a positive effect or a more positive effect than negative effect because it really helps reduce carbon emissions for a large population that need housing. And more efficient designs or more environmental designs would really help reduce environmental pollution. So that would increase support for upzoning. And this is also a somewhat strong effect overall.",

        "answer": "I think I'm somewhat confident, about 73% confident that changes in pollution lead to changes in support for upzoning. Because I've seen and heard that upzoning or vertical expansion can probably help reduce carbon emission so it's going to help with pollution most of the time but at the same time there's going to be more garbage when there's more population and there's going to be more crowding or noise pollution. So I'm not completely confident but I'm somewhat confident that it's going to help reduce carbon emission when there's more energy efficient design or environmental design. It's just kind of help reduce carbon footprint per person based on what I've heard and read. It would have a more positive effect on the support for upzoning and this would be a somewhat strong effect.",

It would have a negative effect on the support for upzoning because when there's upzoning there's going to be more population renting or buying homes in the area I think so that's going to lead to more noise and crowding and traffic congestion. So that's going to really have a negative impact on the peace and quiet in the public areas and when the peace and quiet is disturbed there's crowding there's more noise that's going to lead to oppositions.
