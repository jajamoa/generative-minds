When more homes are available, people may support zoning more because it helps with housing needs. So, the effect is mostly positive—it increases support. This effect might not be very strong for everyone. Some people may still worry about traffic or neighborhood changes even if housing improves. Overall, more housing supply usually helps people feel better about upzoning, but other concerns can also influence their opinions.",

If too many apartments are built too quickly, it will result in a large loss for forests and other natural land. There needs to be a balance between providing housing for people while maintaining the environments safety.",

On the other hand, future residents also deserve to have an affordable shelter in a reasonable amount of time, so multiple apartments should be built.
