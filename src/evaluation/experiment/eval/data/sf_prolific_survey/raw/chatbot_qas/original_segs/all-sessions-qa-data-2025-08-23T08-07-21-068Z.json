I would have to get up and move my car because of the street cleaning. And then sometimes I had great difficulty even finding a place to park, or I'd have to find a garage and pay to park just to go home. Like I just, I remember like not being able to get home like at times because the traffic was so bad and like really having to use the bathroom. It was horrible. I didn't ever want to live like that again. And yet I feel like it's coming to where I am now. And I really, really hate that because I really don't want to mess with parking or loud neighbors or, you know, ruining my peaceful day because I hate my neighbors. You know, that type of thing.

I don't know anyone that supports it, but maybe the Californians from across the street who just moved here for an investment property want to like basically build an apartment building on their property so they can get more money and then just take that money and move somewhere else, you know, if they're concerned about taxes or something and just need to reinvest, that's probably what's going on. I feel like a lot of people in my neighborhood aren't even home, like they don't even live here and they probably just bought it as an investment property or maybe they're even in China or something like heck if I know, it's just weird.",

I already live too close to my neighbors. I'm really upset because I can't enjoy my backyard sometimes and I moved here specifically because I wanted to have a garden like just today for instance not to be gross but I could hear my neighbor having sex and that's disgusting and I don't want to hear it in my backyard. I want my right to peace and quiet enjoyment of my property which I already don't have because my landlady's a nightmare so I don't want to be going outside and having to hear my neighbor or having to smell cigarette smoke from a neighbor that moved in and is renting the property. I'm not opposed to renters. I am a renter myself. I think that there are good renters and quiet renters and people who are considerate of others but if I had to move back into an apartment building, not to be dramatic, but I would shoot myself in the mouth. I just don't want to live in that kind of proximity to other humans. I really dislike people and most of the time I really don't enjoy having to live even as close to them as I already do and if this upzoning thing goes through it's just going to be worse. I feel like upzoning might make housing more affordable, but not enough to offset the decreased quality of life or make it worth the sacrifice of the character of a residential community. It would just make the rich property hoarders aka landlords richer and less single family homes available for regular families because they keep being purchased by investors who do not care about the neighborhood other than for their personal profit.",

I don't know if I'm supposed to share that with you, but I hate Austin. I don't like what it's become. I really regret coming back here. It's just like Los Angeles now, and there's a lot of people here from there. It's basically a bunch of ugly condos going up that are probably still overpriced even though they say the rents are going down, yada, yada, yada. I don't know if I really believe that, but I think a lot of those condos are unoccupied and they're just like great, big, huge, giant. I mean, they're just apartment buildings. I don't know why they're called condos or whatever. It's just an apartment building is what it is. It's like an overpriced apartment building or like a fancy, bougie-looking apartment building, but when it comes down to it, you're still living on top of other people. I don't like the idea of that at all.\n\nIt's going to ruin the character of the neighborhood. Right now, it's kind of out on the main road where the condos are, but I feel like they're getting closer. There's a hundred-plus-year-old farmhouse down the street that used to be a coffee shop I could walk to at the end of my street, and now it's being torn down to build another stupid condo we don't need. There's more than enough of them around here already, and I bet you they are not fully occupied at all.",

But all the things that they're against and that they campaign against, and I'm sure that they are contacting their representatives and they're voting for representatives that they believe will listen to them. It just seems to happen anyway, though. So I don't know, they've been trying to stop it or she's been trying to stop it, but it doesn't seem to be working.

I feel like, you know, like I said, these upzoning/coding changes are just going through, whether we want them or not. But I believe they did give consent for people to build a, what is it called, an ADU, basically like a mother-in-law or an additional house on their property. So I know it's going to make parking worse. I mean, I just feel like no matter what, eventually this is going to become Los Angeles, where I unfortunately had the misfortune to live for close to 20 years. And I just remember a lot of, you know, even though we lived in a residential neighborhood, having to constantly move my car, having to like read all these parking restriction signs, having to like not being able to park my car overnight to where I could sleep comfortably. I would have to get up and move my car because of the street cleaning. And then sometimes I had great difficulty even finding a place to park, or I'd have to find a garage and pay to park just to go home. Like I just, I remember like not being able to get home like at times because the traffic was so bad and like really having to use the bathroom. It was horrible. I didn't ever want to live like that again. And yet I feel like it's coming to where I am now. And I really, really hate that because I really don't want to mess with parking or loud neighbors or, you know, ruining my peaceful day because I hate my neighbors. You know, that type of thing. I just am not looking forward to it getting even worse. And I'm sure with people having multiple units on their property, although I'm sure the property owners are happy about it because that just means that they get more money and they don't even really need it.

I guess, like, I don't even understand that thinking. I guess if they're thinking that people are going to live more in condos or something, that they're not going to have cars, because, trust me, they're going to have cars, so traffic congestion is going to go up, so I don't think it's going to increase support for upzoning, because the traffic's just not going to go down, and even if it did go down, I don't think people would make the connection.",

Frankly, I don't see how they afford one. I can't even really afford one, but somebody purchased one for me. Otherwise, I would probably be having to use public transportation, but I also strongly prefer to work from home, so maybe that's not as big an issue, but a lot of people now are being forced back into the office, so that might not work either.",

I would think it would have a positive effect, but not a very strong positive effect because people, I don't know, I think we already have a lot of urban density, so I don't see why those people care. I guess the only people that might care are the ones that live downtown, for instance, maybe don't want to live downtown anymore, but want to move somewhere a little bit more livable or a little more suburban. They might support upzoning because they want to be able to rent a unit a little bit away from the city, but I feel like if you live in the city, you live in the city because you want to live in the city and not in a residential neighborhood.",

Because if you disapprove of littering, you probably don't support upzoning because if you have more people, you've got more problems. And it's a strong inverse connection and it would have a negative effect on support for upzoning because people litter. But I think it's also kind of cultural, to be honest with you, not to be racist, but it just is. I see a lot more litter in certain areas and certain minorities and I'm sure it just has to do with people's privilege. Because if they grew up in a crappy neighborhood where there's crap everywhere through no fault of their own and nobody ever taught them not to throw stuff on the ground, that's one thing, but if you grow up in a very fancy neighborhood with a HOA or something where people yell at you for having visible trash cans, you're probably less likely to throw things on the ground.",

Maybe people who compost and recycle are more altruistic, but I'm not.

More housing options could mean more affordability and diversity in neighborhoods, which I see as a good thing. \nThat said, I understand why some people are hesitant. There are valid concerns about how it might affect traffic, parking, school capacity, and even the character of a neighborhood. I think support for upzoning really depends on how it's implemented. If it's done with proper planning—like making sure infrastructure and public services are scaled appropriately—I think it can be a positive step forward.\nSo, overall, I’m supportive, but I believe it needs to be thoughtful and community-informed, not just developer-driven.",

More units mean more supply, which can ease pressure on rents and home prices, especially in high-demand areas. It also opens up neighborhoods to a more diverse mix of people—different income levels, family sizes, and backgrounds—which can lead to stronger, more vibrant communities.\nAnother upside is that denser neighborhoods often support better public transportation, walkability, and small local businesses, because there's simply more foot traffic and demand.\nOn the negative side, if it's not done carefully, it can put strain on local infrastructure—like roads, public schools, and sanitation systems. There's also the issue of neighborhood character—some long-time residents may feel like they’re losing the familiar look and feel of their community, which can create tension.\nSo to me, the impact depends a lot on how cities manage the transition. Density can be really beneficial, but only if it’s paired with smart planning and meaningful input from the people who live there.",

        "answer": "I would say I 'somewhat support upzoning', but with some important caveats. I think allowing higher-density housing—like duplexes, small apartment buildings, or mixed-use developments—can be a smart way to address the housing shortage, especially in cities where prices have gotten out of control. More housing options could mean more affordability and diversity in neighborhoods, which I see as a good thing. \nThat said, I understand why some people are hesitant. There are valid concerns about how it might affect traffic, parking, school capacity, and even the character of a neighborhood. I think support for upzoning really depends on how it's implemented. If it's done with proper planning—like making sure infrastructure and public services are scaled appropriately—I think it can be a positive step forward.\nSo, overall, I’m supportive, but I believe it needs to be thoughtful and community-informed, not just developer-driven.",

        "category": "research",
        "answer": "I think one of the biggest 'positive impacts' of increasing housing density is that it can help alleviate the housing crisis. More units mean more supply, which can ease pressure on rents and home prices, especially in high-demand areas. It also opens up neighborhoods to a more diverse mix of people—different income levels, family sizes, and backgrounds—which can lead to stronger, more vibrant communities.\nAnother upside is that denser neighborhoods often support better public transportation, walkability, and small local businesses, because there's simply more foot traffic and demand.\nOn the negative side, if it's not done carefully, it can put strain on local infrastructure—like roads, public schools, and sanitation systems. There's also the issue of neighborhood character—some long-time residents may feel like they’re losing the familiar look and feel of their community, which can create tension.\nSo to me, the impact depends a lot on how cities manage the transition. Density can be really beneficial, but only if it’s paired with smart planning and meaningful input from the people who live there.",

On the positive side, higher density can actually be better for the environment—people drive less, cities use land more efficiently, and it can reduce urban sprawl, which helps protect green space and farmland.\nBut there are also real concerns, like how new buildings affect air quality, tree cover, and stormwater runoff. If cities don’t plan for green space, energy efficiency, and sustainable building practices, increased density could create new environmental problems.

        "answer": "Changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing can have several economic effects.\nOn the positive side, it can boost the local economy by creating jobs in construction, increasing demand for local businesses, and generating more property tax revenue. It can also ease housing shortages, which helps keep prices and rents more stable, making cities more affordable for workers and families.\nOn the negative side, if not managed carefully, it might lead to gentrification—raising property values in a way that pushes out lower-income residents. There's also a risk that developers focus on high-end units rather than truly affordable housing, which could leave the most vulnerable people behind.\nOverall, the economic impact depends a lot on how inclusive and thoughtful the zoning changes are.

Current residents know their neighborhoods best and have real concerns about things like traffic, schools, and community character. But we also have to recognize that housing decisions made today affect whether future residents—like young people, essential workers, or new families—can afford to live there at all.\nIf we only listen to current residents, we risk freezing neighborhoods in time and making cities less inclusive and more expensive. On the flip side, change shouldn’t be forced in ways that ignore people’s lived experiences.

        "answer": "Social equity and access to opportunity should be at the heart of zoning and housing policy discussions. Where people can afford to live directly affects their access to good schools, safe neighborhoods, jobs, and transportation. If zoning laws only allow expensive single-family homes, they end up shutting out lower- and middle-income families—often disproportionately impacting people of color.\nUpzoning and inclusive housing policies can help correct some of those imbalances by creating more affordable options in areas that have traditionally been exclusive. It’s not just about buildings—it’s about who gets to live where, and what kind of future they can build from there. So in my view, equity shouldn’t be a side note—it should be a guiding principle.",

        "answer": "The effect of a housing shortage on support for upzoning is generally positive, but it takes time to develop. At first, people may not connect rising rents or limited availability directly to zoning rules. But as the shortage becomes more visible—through price hikes, displacement, or long waitlists for housing—public awareness grows, and support for solutions like upzoning tends to increase.\nThat said, the strength of the effect is moderate. While some people respond by supporting higher-density housing, others become more protective of their neighborhoods, especially if they fear change or don’t trust how upzoning will be implemented. So yes, housing shortages can increase support for upzoning over time, but it’s not automatic or overwhelming—it often depends on how the issue is framed and who is affected.",

        "text": "Small increases in the number of housing units, such as adding a few duplexes or triplexes to a neighborhood, might not have an immediate or large impact on public opinion or support for upzoning. People may not perceive these changes as significant enough to see the full benefits of upzoning, especially in neighborhoods with larger housing shortages.\nExample: In a city facing a severe housing crisis, adding a few extra units might not do enough to change the overall market dynamics, so people may not immediately connect these changes with greater affordability or access to housing.\nPositive or Negative Effect?:\nPositive effect: If people perceive that even small increases in housing units are steps in the right direction and are properly integrated into the neighborhood, there may be gradual increases in support for upzoning.\n\nNegative effect: On the flip side, small changes may not be enough to alleviate concerns over rising housing costs or demand, which could result in frustration or disappointment among residents who expect more substantial change.\n2. Larger Changes in Housing Units (Significant Shifts):\nMore Noticeable Impact: Larger, more significant increases in housing units (e.g., several apartment buildings, large mixed-use developments) are more likely to lead to noticeable changes in public opinion because they have a more direct impact on the housing market, infrastructure, and the community’s character. These changes are more likely to be felt by residents and to shift perceptions.\n\nExample: A large new housing development can provide many new homes and apartments, alleviating housing shortages in a more tangible way. This could lead to noticeable decreases in rent or more available units, which would likely increase support for similar upzoning efforts in the future.\n\nPositive or Negative Effect?:\nPositive effect: In high-demand urban areas with housing shortages, large increases in housing units could help decrease rents and improve access to housing, generating stronger support for upzoning. It’s seen as a direct solution to affordability and availability issues.\n\nNegative effect: Larger developments can sometimes be met with resistance (often from NIMBY groups) due to concerns about loss of neighborhood character, increased traffic, or overcrowding. This opposition can decrease support for upzoning, particularly in communities where the density is seen as overwhelming or disruptive.\n3. Does It Have a Positive or Negative Effect on Support for Upzoning?\nSmall Changes: The impact of small changes tends to be neutral to slightly positive, depending on how they are framed and perceived by the community. The small changes may be seen as a step forward but not sufficient to solve the problem, leading to modest support or no significant change in attitudes.\n\nLarger Changes: Larger changes tend to have a more noticeable positive effect, especially when they significantly contribute to alleviating housing shortages or improving community amenities. However, if the changes are too drastic or poorly planned, they can also increase resistance, especially if residents feel that the changes are too abrupt or disrupt their quality of life.\n\n4. Strength of the Effect:\nSmall Changes: The strength of the effect is weaker for small changes in housing units. While they may gradually help build support over time, they are unlikely to have an immediate, dramatic influence on public opinion unless they are part of a broader, well-communicated strategy.\n\nLarger Changes: The effect of larger changes is stronger because they are more tangible, provide visible results, and more directly address community needs like affordability. However, the level of support will also depend on how well these changes are managed and integrated into the existing community.",

        "answer": "I generally support upzoning policies that allow for higher-density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods, especially when they are implemented thoughtfully and with community input. These policies can help address housing shortages, increase affordability, and reduce urban sprawl by making more efficient use of existing infrastructure.\nBy allowing for duplexes, triplexes, and small apartment buildings in areas previously restricted to single-family homes, upzoning can create more diverse housing options and open up neighborhoods to a broader range of income levels. This can also support walkability, transit access, and more vibrant local economies.",

        "answer": "Improved Housing Affordability: By allowing more units per lot, increased density can help meet housing demand and reduce upward pressure on prices and rents.\nMore Diverse Housing Options: Density enables the development of smaller, more affordable units that can serve students, seniors, and lower-income households.\nEnvironmental Benefits: Denser neighborhoods reduce reliance on cars, support public transit, and lower per-capita energy use and emissions.\nEconomic Vitality: More residents can support local businesses and lead to more vibrant, walkable communities.\n\nNegative Impacts:\nInfrastructure Strain: Without adequate planning, higher density can put pressure on schools, roads, water systems, and public services.\nNeighborhood Character Changes: Some residents may feel that increased density alters the aesthetic or historic identity of their neighborhood.\nParking and Traffic: More units can increase street parking competition and congestion if transportation planning doesn’t keep up.\nRisk of Displacement: In some cases, redevelopment can lead to rising property values and the displacement of long-time residents if protections aren’t in place.",

        "answer": "Small increases in the number of housing units, such as adding a few duplexes or triplexes to a neighborhood, might not have an immediate or large impact on public opinion or support for upzoning. People may not perceive these changes as significant enough to see the full benefits of upzoning, especially in neighborhoods with larger housing shortages.\nExample: In a city facing a severe housing crisis, adding a few extra units might not do enough to change the overall market dynamics, so people may not immediately connect these changes with greater affordability or access to housing.\nPositive or Negative Effect?:\nPositive effect: If people perceive that even small increases in housing units are steps in the right direction and are properly integrated into the neighborhood, there may be gradual increases in support for upzoning.\n\nNegative effect: On the flip side, small changes may not be enough to alleviate concerns over rising housing costs or demand, which could result in frustration or disappointment among residents who expect more substantial change.\n2. Larger Changes in Housing Units (Significant Shifts):\nMore Noticeable Impact: Larger, more significant increases in housing units (e.g., several apartment buildings, large mixed-use developments) are more likely to lead to noticeable changes in public opinion because they have a more direct impact on the housing market, infrastructure, and the community’s character. These changes are more likely to be felt by residents and to shift perceptions.\n\nExample: A large new housing development can provide many new homes and apartments, alleviating housing shortages in a more tangible way. This could lead to noticeable decreases in rent or more available units, which would likely increase support for similar upzoning efforts in the future.\n\nPositive or Negative Effect?:\nPositive effect: In high-demand urban areas with housing shortages, large increases in housing units could help decrease rents and improve access to housing, generating stronger support for upzoning. It’s seen as a direct solution to affordability and availability issues.\n\nNegative effect: Larger developments can sometimes be met with resistance (often from NIMBY groups) due to concerns about loss of neighborhood character, increased traffic, or overcrowding. This opposition can decrease support for upzoning, particularly in communities where the density is seen as overwhelming or disruptive.\n3. Does It Have a Positive or Negative Effect on Support for Upzoning?\nSmall Changes: The impact of small changes tends to be neutral to slightly positive, depending on how they are framed and perceived by the community. The small changes may be seen as a step forward but not sufficient to solve the problem, leading to modest support or no significant change in attitudes.\n\nLarger Changes: Larger changes tend to have a more noticeable positive effect, especially when they significantly contribute to alleviating housing shortages or improving community amenities. However, if the changes are too drastic or poorly planned, they can also increase resistance, especially if residents feel that the changes are too abrupt or disrupt their quality of life.\n\n4. Strength of the Effect:\nSmall Changes: The strength of the effect is weaker for small changes in housing units. While they may gradually help build support over time, they are unlikely to have an immediate, dramatic influence on public opinion unless they are part of a broader, well-communicated strategy.\n\nLarger Changes: The effect of larger changes is stronger because they are more tangible, provide visible results, and more directly address community needs like affordability. However, the level of support will also depend on how well these changes are managed and integrated into the existing community.",

I'm not really aware of any negative economic effects that might come with allowing more multi-family housing unless the multi-family housing doesn't get filled and were just left with empty spaces.",

        "answer": "Ideally it should be up to the current residents to decide when it comes to making zoning decisions but I don't see why they would agree to increasing the amount of residents in their neighborhood and increase the overall traffic. So I don't think any current residents especially owners would be approving of these changes, as it might affect the pricing of their residential homes. So ideally they should have a say and I think the residents would treat their new neighbors better if they were approving of it in the first place, so probably yeah they should have a higher weight when it comes to making zoning decions",

Obviously, the downside is how change affects our feelings. And people do worry about losing something that's familiar, that's quiet, you know, the space, the parking.

I grew up in the Sunset and I now live up in Diamond Heights. So I've been, I've seen firsthand how hard it's gotten for regular people to live in the city they love. Upzoning doesn't mean tearing down, you know, every single home or ruining neighborhoods. It means giving people more chances to stay, build a life, and perhaps raise a family here. We definitely need more housing options, period. And we're not just talking luxury high-rises, but, you know, homes that real working people like myself can actually afford. If it's done right, you know, upzoning can really help us get there.",

        "answer": "Well, you know, the biggest impact of increasing housing density is probably that more people have a real shot at living in San Francisco. And that's definitely an upside. You've got more homes, you've got more neighbors and, you know, hopefully more diversity. We priced out so many folks already, you know, with that booming tech industry that we have, you know, but it doesn't have to be that way all the time. Obviously, the downside is how change affects our feelings. And people do worry about losing something that's familiar, that's quiet, you know, the space, the parking. And if we're not careful, developers might just build for profit and not really for the people. So the key is definitely smart planning, you know, build the neighborhood in mind and not just build a skyline.",

We've seen that before. But if the city ties upzoning to real affordable housing, like units that teachers, nurses, flight attendants, and working families can actually afford, then it definitely can make a real difference.

A lot of San Francisco spirit comes from people you know families, immigrants, artists, small business owners. You know if we don't make room for those kind of people the city becomes less attractive, not necessarily more attractive. So yeah I think the neighborhood might feel a little bit different but if done right you know the quality of life definitely can improve.

In fact, we might actually reduce it. More people living close together where they work or shop means, you know, fewer cars on the road. The real issue is making sure our transit system keeps up, like BART and MUNI and buses, you know, things like that, you know, bike lanes, in fact.

You have more housing and that usually means more jobs in construction, means more customers for local businesses, means more people who can afford to live in there where they work and you know Bay Area is very very expensive. That's good for the city but as I've stressed all along, if we don't do it correctly it's gonna drive up land values and push out longtime residents, perhaps my children and even myself and small businesses that can't keep up with the rising costs.

Zoning isn't just about the pretty buildings or the architecture. It's about who gets to really live here and who gets left out, and the haves and the have-nots. For far too long, zoning laws have been used to keep certain people out, especially low-income families, immigrants, and people of color. That's just bad policy. It's definitely wrong. Housing is an opportunity. It's access to good schools, clean air, good jobs, and a real shot at stability. If we really care about fairness, we have to fix the system.

But if the community sees real guarantees, and they might go along with it, they don't just want empty promises. Zoning feels like it's a developer free-for-all, support drops really quickly. People don't like change, they're usually against change. They're definitely against being priced out of it.

When long-term residency neighbor is forced out, you know, that trust breaks down quickly. And people don't wait to see the long-term benefits, they react to what they see now and what's happening now. It's a very strong effect. You know, displacement makes folks feel like the city is being taken from them, you know, not shared. And especially those, you know, who have been there a long time. Even if the policy has good intentions, if people see their community as being erased in support for upzoning, it disappears very quickly. But unless, you know, protections are built from the start, displacement kills trust and definitely support within it.",

The stories, the landmarks, the way a place feels because of who's lived there. For many, it has a negative effect on upzoning, especially if the change feels rushed and if it's incomplete, like it's swiping out the past. People want to protect what they've known and loved for so many years. That feeling can be strong, especially in neighborhoods with deep roots. But if upzoning respects that history, you know, not just with plaques and trophies and all those kind of things, but with actual real care, the resistance can soften over time. Still, memory runs deep, and if you ignore that, the support fades very, very quickly.",

When folks see strong policies that protect renters, fund affordable housing, and prevent displacement, strong support for upzoning does go up, and that's a very strong effect. Reviewed policy builds great trust, but when housing policy is weak, confusing, and feels like it only helps the developers with thousands of millions of dollars, the support drops quick like a rock, drop it like it's hot.

You know, so I guess that can be a positive increasing effect, but I'm fairly certain about this. It's happening in real time across the, you know, cities, you know, public and private investment in affordable housing, more funding, more units, et cetera, you know, positive increasing effect, you know, I'm only certain depends on whether funding actually reaches the right projects, you know, higher interest rates, slowing demand. Some buyers are sitting it out, you know, leaving more rental openings, you know, a mixed effect, you know, can increase availability, but not necessarily affordability. I am somewhat certain it's a side effects. It's not a longterm fix, remote work shifts, you know, fewer people needing to live in these high cost urban dense areas, you know, positive, you know, it has a positive increasing effect in some cities, neutral in others, you know, moderate certainty still is playing out.

But when trust is broken, you know, when decisions are made behind closed doors or people get displaced without wanting it and feel like things to come down behind their back, you know, support really drops fast and hard.

You know, enough people can't afford to live in a city, something's got to give to get priced out. So, you know, you get political leadership and city priorities that are definitely a strong influence. A mayor or city council pushing for change can shift that policy or maybe just entirely block it. I think, you know, community pressure and advocacy is a moderate to strong influence. If neighborhoods organize and push for more inclusive housing, it can definitely move the needle. You know, also, you know, especially when the media picks it up. And then you get the developers and business interests, strong influence, but sometimes controversial. They bring money and momentum, but not always the community, it's a buy-in. And then you get the state or federal mandates, strong and growing influences, especially in cities like California, you know, where the state is stepping in when the city calls or city solve. So yeah, most of these influences are strong. The question is whether they're being used to help everyone or just a few.",
