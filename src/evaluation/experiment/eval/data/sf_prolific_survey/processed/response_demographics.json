It was quieter, but that famous fog? Yeah, it\u2019s real. Then, when my job went remote, I jumped at the chance to try the Richmond District a little more space, a little less rent stress, and way closer to hikes at Lands End. Every move came with tradeoffs for me but each neighborhood taught me something new about the city."

Most recently, I relocated to a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment closer to my workplace in the Mission District. Each move was driven mainly by financial considerations, changes in work commute, and the need for more affordable or convenient living arrangements."
