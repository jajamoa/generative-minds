I live with my husband and our two young kids, currently 1 and 3 years old. We\u2019ve been able to maintain a stable rental situation, though space and affordability are always on our minds.\n\nBefore having kids, we lived in a smaller apartment, which worked fine for just the two of us. But when we found out we were expecting our first child in 2022, we decided to move into a larger rental in a quieter, more family-friendly neighborhood. We wanted a place with nearby parks, good childcare options, and enough room for our growing family.\n\nWhile we didn't have to navigate newborns during the height of the pandemic, the lasting effects\u2014like rising costs and limited housing options\u2014have definitely shaped our decisions. Buying a home in the city still feels financially out of reach, but we\u2019re focused on stability, and making sure our kids have a safe and comfortable environment to grow up in."

The pandemic also influenced my housing decisions\u2014remote work made proximity to downtown less important, and I prioritized space and quieter surroundings. Overall, my housing status remained stable, but affordability and quality of life were key factors in my decisions."

That worked well during the pandemic when I was working from home and needed more privacy.\nLast year, I moved again this time with my partner to a one-bedroom in the Mission. We wanted to enjoy sunnier weather and more going on around us. Each move was mostly driven by a combination of rent increases, changes in my personal life, and the constant trade-off between affordability, space, and neighborhood vibe.\n\n\n"

    "housing_experience": "I have lived in the same flat for over 30 years as I have rent control. My landlord has wanted me out since he bought the building.  During the pandemic he did illegal construction in the building as everyone moved out except me. My building was built in the 1930s. I got very sick and was diagnosed with lead exposure. I had the apartment tested which cost 1800$ that I never got back as my landlord would do nothing to help me. It turns out the amount of lead in the hallway was 10x the amount allowed safe by the EPA. There were other rooms that had an unsafe amount of lead also. There is no law in SF that forces a landlord to do anything to fix your apartment if you get sick from lead. Lead is not taken seriously in this city  like it is in places such as New York. Since my experience I have heard of other people in SF getting lead exposure in their apartment. Only if there are children present will it be illegal .  This law has to change. I lost a lot of weight and felt like I was going insane, there were no services available . Luckily I had good insurance to be able to see an environmental specialist. When one of the building inspectors came, It took 2 months for the building inspector to post his findings. My landlord had to hire someone to redo all the floors and repaint most of the rooms. It took 6 months . He dragged it out, hoping I would move. I could not live in my apartment the whole time. My landlord did not reimburse me for any of this. After hiring an independent inspector who tested the house and agreed it was safe I was finally able to move back in. The landlord had other violations which were all reduced by the other inspectors. The other inspectors had told me there were grave violations, however, after speaking with my landlords reps barely anything was done about those. "

After two years, I moved to a studio in the Inner Richmond for more privacy, as my work situation stabilized and I could afford a higher rent. In 2022, due to a rent increase and the expiration of a rent-controlled lease, I relocated to a one-bedroom unit in the Sunset District. Most of my moves were driven by affordability, job changes, and the desire for a quieter or more spacious living environment."

The rent was also, predictably, quite high and seemed to creep up a little each year.\nAbout three years ago, I decided to look for something a bit bigger and, perhaps, slightly more affordable I ended up moving to a one-bedroom apartment in the Outer Sunset. It was further from the main action, but the apartment was significantly larger, and having more space was a real plus."
